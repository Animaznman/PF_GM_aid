Unquestionably, she took the loss of her mother Gwyndria much harder\nthan Kalabrynne, and every knight knows Clarethe\u2019s truest desire is to conquer\nthe ruins of Vigil. It is most likely this quest that led to the fiery argument between\nher and her surviving mother, when Clarethe stormed from Vellumis with her most\nardent allies in tow. This, then, was the schism among the knights that led to the\nformation of the Crimson Reclaimers. Since then the two Iomedars have made peace,\nand the two orders are one again; family and order each now more tightly bound\nthan ever. Clarethe still prefers the field, though, for she is a creature of action.",

Yet in Rahadoum, where faith in the gods is persecuted, techniques like those pioneered by Kassi are literal lifesavers. With degrees from major universities across Golarion and an apprenticeship with Artokus Kirran, the precocious Kassi Elaran traveled the world to further refine her techniques. Discoveries like kandleare, a deep sea algae with astounding medicinal properties, led to further breakthroughs, and studies with other medical practitioners helped her cultivate kandleare in her laboratories. She returned to Rahadoum to focus on her research, periodically sharing reports or updates with other scholars or government agencies for peer reviews and the like.",

She was introduced to the substance by Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid via a series of missives, but only recently has she started to suspect that his motives might be sinister. By helping her to develop methods of healing based on science rather than faith, the veiled master posing as Hashim hopes to further erode the very concept of faith itself, something very different than what Kassi hopes to accomplish. Now that Kassi has an inkling of the veiled master\u2019s insidious schemes, whether or not its influence will play out the way it plans, only time will tell. Regardless, none can argue that what Kassi has accomplished has been anything but beneficial to her patients and the medical community at large.",

The character is dressed in leather armor and has various pouches and tools attached to their belt, suggesting an alchemist or tinkerer archetype. The background is white, and the image is integrated into a page of text.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 Main subject is a humanoid fantasy character with pointed ears, blue skin, and a bushy beard.\n  \u2022 The character is holding a glowing blue vial in their right hand, which emits a soft blue light.\n  \u2022 The character wears a leather vest, shirt, and has multiple pouches and tools on a belt, indicating a profession related to alchemy or tinkering.\n  \u2022 The illustration is rendered in a painterly style with high detail and vibrant colors, especially blues and browns.\n  \u2022 The background is plain white, with the character positioned on the left side of the page, partially overlapping the text.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.\n  \u2022 The lighting emphasizes the glow from the vial, casting blue highlights on the character\u2019s hand and face.\n  \u2022 No on-image UI elements or text overlays are present.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 The character is in the foreground, facing slightly to the right, with the glowing vial held up at chest level.\n  \u2022 The composition places the character on the left, with the right side of the image blending into the text of the page.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The illustration visually reinforces the theme of alchemy, technology, or magical science, as suggested by the character\u2019s equipment and the glowing vial.\n  \u2022 The use of blue lighting draws attention to the vial, making it the focal point of the image.\n  \u2022 The integration of the character into the page layout suggests this is an in-universe illustration for a fantasy roleplaying game or sourcebook.",

Early reports described the young Magdelena as a natural hunter, but predisposed to thieving, while Martum learned how to manage the plantation finances. Both got along well with their fellow halflings but harbored a burning hate for their owner. At age 14, agents witnessed an escape attempt that ended in the twins\u2019 capture and punishment. These reports quickly reached Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist), who investigated the matter and learned something surprising: her deceased nephew, Hamir Fallows, was the father of the twins.",

The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain.

This might suggest a ferry that transports anyone, no questions asked, or a Bellflower contact that has some means of transport available. The lotus petals also suggest preferred times for passage. A white lotus notes passage available primarily near dawn, while pink and violet lotuses indicate passages at dusk or during the night respectively. Finally, the flower's state of bloom can notify of danger. A fully bloomed lotus announces safe passage while even a single closed lotus on the quilt indicates that travelers should be cautious as there are eyes around that might report suspicious activity. Most of these quilts feature several lotuses to more easily hide a closed lotus.",

Then I slew a great beast and called myself its king, and peace became a possibility where before we had no hope. So I shall be a linnorm king and allow those words to define me in the eyes of strangers, for doing so has given me Ulfen brothers and sisters where once only enemies stood before me.\n\n\u2013Nankou of Icemark",

At once a peerless scholar and a fierce war master, the archwizard\u2019s artifice stands in stark contrast to his centuries-long rivalry with the necromancer Geb. The clash between the two would lead to the loss of countless lives, the ravaging of both lands, the disappearance of Nex himself, and Geb\u2019s transformation to ghostly tyrant.

His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex\u2014a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power\u2014and in rumored immortality.

Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom\u2019s skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city\u2019s gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein.\n\nServing as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex\u2019s horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society\u2019s Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard\u2019s ambition.",

In the years since, Razmir has attracted an influential cult of followers. Lured to him with the promise of prosperity and peace, converts more often than not find themselves struggling to survive in a nation that seems built to funnel wealth and privilege to the priests.

Some stories, for\nexample, claim that he grew up in Taldor, penniless on the\nstreets of Oppara, begging for food and sleeping under a\nsewer grate; others purport that he was raised in Varisia on a\nsmall rural farm, destined to live a simple life until he uncovered\nthe secret library of the Runelords, learning to wield their mighty\npower all on his own. Despite their differences, all of these stories\nbear a few basic similarities.

When arriving in a community, they immediately take up with the poor and indigent, offering them food, aid, and succor, all the while telling these desperate souls about the glory that is Razmir. With the new believers behind them, they then petition to open up a shrine and pressure local businesses to offer up donations to the church to protect and improve the neighborhood. If left unchecked, they soon infiltrate the local militia and then the government, using masks to hide the true identities of the faithful.",
