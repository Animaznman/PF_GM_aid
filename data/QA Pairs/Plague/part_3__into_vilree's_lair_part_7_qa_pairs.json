    "question": "How does the PCs' decision to rest or push on without breaks affect the final confrontation with the drudge?",
    "answer": "If the PCs didn't stop for breaks, the PCs are all fatigued (unless they have horses, in which case the horses are fatigued instead), but they can square off against the drudge while it is still at the edge of town, 120 feet away from the stone. If the PCs rested, the drudge starts only 60 feet from the stone, near the middle of town."
