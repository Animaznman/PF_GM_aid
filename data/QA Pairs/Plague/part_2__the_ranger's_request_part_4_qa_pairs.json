    "question": "What are the special traits of the Stone Horse's Hoof attack?",
    "answer": "The Stone Horse's hooves are as hard as iron. A critical hit with a Hoof Strike damages the target's armor, dealing damage equal to what was dealt to the target (after Hardness). If the target uses Shield Block against a critical hit, the shield's Hardness is reduced by 5 (minimum 0)."

    "question": "What hazard is present in the South Cage area?",
    "answer": "The area near the South Cage contains a large pool of toxic sludge, which emits fumes. Creatures in the draft of the fumes take 1d4 acid damage and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened 1. Being adjacent to the pool also causes 1d4 acid damage."

    "source_file": "part_2:_the_ranger's_request_part_4.md",
    "question": "What is the wind mechanic associated with the toxic sludge?",
    "answer": "At the start of the fight, roll 1d8 to determine the wind direction. Each round, roll 1d8 to see if the wind shifts. A roll of 1-2 means it shifts one direction clockwise, 3-6 means it stays the same, and 7-8 means it shifts one direction counterclockwise."

    "answer": "A character trained in Nature can calm the leopard with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check. A critical failure causes it to attack."

    "question": "How can the PCs alleviate the Fiery Leopard's suffering?",
    "answer": "The PCs can hydrate the leopard by chilling water with a ray of frost or similar effect. Also, a successful DC 15 Medicine check reveals that it has been wounded, and healing it for 3 Hit Points restores it to full health."
  },
  {
    "source_file": "part_2:_the_ranger's_request_part_4.md",
    "question": "What happens if the PCs hydrate and heal the Fiery Leopard?",
    "answer": "If the PCs hydrate and heal the leopard, it perks up and wants to escape. It may bolt out of the cage, into the yard, up a wall, and out of the Pen."
