    "question": "What is the Sculptor's strategy in combat, and when will he attempt to flee?",
    "answer": "The Sculptor stays in the fight as long as it goes his way, using his minions to take the brunt of the damage and harrying the PCs with bombs. He will attempt to flee when he thinks he's losing, escaping through the refuse pit, the laboratory, past the cages, and out into the wilderness. If reduced to half Hit Points or fewer, Noala spots him and hunts him down; otherwise, if he has more than half HP remaining, he wounds Noala and traps her to allow his escape to Vilree."

    "question": "What information can be gained from the Sculptor's notes with a DC 15 Crafting check?",
    "answer": "A broad outline of Vilree's experiments can be uncovered, detailing her past requests for experiments to evolve permanent mutations in creatures, which became too bestial. The notes also mention the 'coagulant thing' the Sculptor is creating for the mistress."

    "source_file": "part_2:_the_ranger's_request_part_6.md",
    "question": "What was the 'viridian vapor' experiment?",
    "answer": "About 3 years ago, Vilree commanded the orcs to capture a human, place them in a covered pit in the woods, and expose them to something called the viridian vapor. The human died in agony in less than a day, after which the body was burned, and the pit filled in."

    "source_file": "part_2:_the_ranger's_request_part_6.md",
    "question": "How is the blood ooze created and what triggers its attack?",
    "answer": "The blood ooze is created by extracting blood from humanoids, mixing it with alchemical reagents, and then pumping it back into a human prisoner. It is kept docile using a spray of caustic agents. Approaching the body without the agent causes the ooze to burst from its human enclosure and attack."

    "question": "What does Noala ask the PCs to do after they deal with the creatures in the Pen?",
    "answer": "Noala implores the PCs to bring Vilree to justice 'for Bort's sake, if not for the sake of the woods', as she believes Vilree is responsible for all of the blights."
  },
  {
    "source_file": "part_2:_the_ranger's_request_part_6.md",
    "question": "Why does Noala decline to accompany the PCs to Spite's Cradle?",
    "answer": "Noala declines to accompany the PCs to Spite's Cradle, citing that her place is in the woods, and keeping the forest safe is a full-time job until the threat has been removed. She promises to share secrets of the forest through training upon their return."
