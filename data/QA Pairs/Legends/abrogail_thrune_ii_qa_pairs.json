    "question": "What is a Thrune Contract and what are its effects?",
    "answer": "A Thrune contract is a diabolically binding magical contract that Abrogail Thrune II, empowered by Asmodeus, can enter into with other mortals. It provides specific benefits and drawbacks. The contract functions like a magic item with the contract trait, is automatically invested, and consigns the signer's soul to Hell upon death unless freed. The contract cannot be dispelled, altered, or destroyed, except by destroying both copies."

    "answer": "Abrogail uses her reputation as being immature, capricious, and demanding to keep those who underestimate her off-balance. She controls the fractious noble houses and byzantine bureaucracy of Cheliax predominantly through fear, and punishes those who offend her personally by petrifying them."

    "answer": "Abrogail was forced to cede independence to Ravounel and has failed to reclaim the former colony of Vidrian (Sargava). These defeats are a still-festering wound, and she ceaselessly contemplates how to extend her influence in the Inner Sea region to compensate for them."

    "question": "What are some of Abrogail Thrune II's recent actions against religious groups and how does she justify them?",
    "answer": "Abrogail seized the opportunity to massacre the church of Iomedae in Egorian for \"seditious activity\", using the sword *Heart's Edge* as a trap to trick the faithful into treason. She also issued a public excruciation order against Kassi Aziril, a Rahadoumi healer, for her godless philosophies, which Abrogail declared blasphemous against Iomedae and Asmodeus."
