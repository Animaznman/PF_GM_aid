    "question": "What is sovereign steel and what benefits does it provide?",
    "answer": "Sovereign steel is a rare alloy of cold iron and the skymetal noqual, created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul. Items made from it have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic, and grant this bonus to the owner's saves to protect the item from magic. Sovereign steel weapons are treated as cold iron against creatures with a weakness to it and cause spellcasters to become stupefied 1 for 1 round on a critical hit. Sovereign steel armor sickens creatures with weakness to cold iron and provides a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against spell attack rolls but imposes a flat check on casting spells."

    "question": "Describe Khismar Crookchar's relationship with Gawta the medusa, and why does he maintain it?",
    "answer": "Khismar and Gawta have an alliance based on mutual benefit. Khismar supplies Gawta with regular shipments of plasma hype, and in return, she petrifies remnants of the Technic League and delivers their heads to Khismar, because she is addicted to the hype that Khismar provides. Khismar utilizes multiple safeguards due to her dangerous gaze."

Khismar named them in part after the medusa Gawta's blue markings on her red scales for plausible deniability."
