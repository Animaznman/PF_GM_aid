    "question": "How has becoming Hurricane Queen impacted Tessa Fairwind?",
    "answer": "While Tessa preferred a carefree life, the power of being Hurricane Queen has given her refuge from consequences. This has made her somewhat reckless, leading to successful raids like the one on Cheliax, but also causing concern among other pirate lords who view her as potentially weak and irresponsible."

    "question": "How does Queen Telandia balance her need for alliances with the concerns of her elven subjects?",
    "answer": "Queen Telandia balances her need for alliances by opening Kyonin to outsiders to gather allies against Tar-Baphon, while simultaneously hiring diplomats to placate her elven subjects who fear losing their nation to outsiders or want her to focus on other threats like Treerazer."
