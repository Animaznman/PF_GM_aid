    "question": "How does sovereign steel differ from other skymetals like noqual, and what is its significance?",
    "answer": "Sovereign steel is an alloy of cold iron and noqual developed by Kevoth-Kul. Noqual typically exhibits magic-resistant properties, making magic weapons crafted from it difficult and expensive to create. Sovereign steel seems to avoid this trait, suggesting a specialized application or purpose, as seen in the Blade of the Black Sovereign."
