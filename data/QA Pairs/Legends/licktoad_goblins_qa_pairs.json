    "question": "What is the Licktoad Goblin's atomizer and how does it work?",
    "answer": "Khismar developed an atomizer that distributes elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. It holds one consumable at a time and has 10 uses before requiring reagent replacement. Activating it via an Interact action allows you to spray the contents on yourself, an ally, or an unattended object, granting the target the consumable's effects. Another activation method allows you to fire the held consumable at a square within 30 feet, creating a cloud that affects the first valid target to enter."

    "answer": "The Corpse Heart was intended as a container for storage within a zombie, designed to break on impact. A side effect where a fire ray caused a subject's \"flaming guts\" to damage nearby targets led to the development of the deadbomb serum, aimed at recreating this effect."
