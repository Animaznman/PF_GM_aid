means that there’s a very high chance at least one of them
will succeed. Most of the time, that’s perfectly fine, but
sometimes you’ll want the task to be a challenge, with
some uncertainty as to whether the party can succeed.
In these cases, make the check very hard, or incredibly
hard if you want it to be particularly difficult or at high
levels. At these DCs, most of the party will probably fail,
but someone might still succeed, likely a character who
has heavily invested in the given skill, as is expected for
specialized characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.236), with ID a2d917d8-ecb9-4d33-8f6d-a0634b069ebe -->

## Minimum Proficiency
Sometimes succeeding at a particular task requires a character to have a specific proficiency rank in addition to a success at the check. Locks and traps often require a certain proficiency rank to successfully use the Pick a Lock or Disable a Device actions of Thievery. A character whose proficiency rank is lower than what’s listed can attempt the check, but they can’t succeed. You can apply similar minimum proficiencies to other tasks. You might decide, for example, that a particular occult theorem requires training in Occultism to understand. An untrained barbarian can’t succeed at the check, but she can still attempt it if she wants—after all, she needs to have a chance to critically fail and get erroneous information! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.244,r=0.471,b=0.479), with ID aac7ee10-76ac-408c-940b-10a4ef22c67c -->

For checks that require a minimum proficiency, keep the following guidelines in mind. A 2nd-level or lower task should almost never require expert proficiency, a 6th-level or lower task should almost never require master proficiency, and a 14th-level or lower task should almost never require legendary proficiency. If they did, no character of the appropriate level could succeed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.480,r=0.471,b=0.587), with ID ba3d24e2-1013-4d7c-af65-32abf45ade76 -->

Specific Actions
You as the GM set the DCs for certain checks or determine other parameters. Here are guidelines for the most common tasks. Remember that all of these are guidelines, and you can adjust them as necessary to suit the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.597,r=0.471,b=0.694), with ID 1b633c9b-5fd0-4351-85d9-5930323829c6 -->

Craft  
When a character Crafts an item, use the item’s level to determine the DC, applying the adjustments for the item’s rarity if it’s not common. You might also apply the easy DC adjustment for an item the crafter has made before. Repairing an item usually uses the DC of the item’s level with no adjustments, though you might adjust the DC to be more difficult for an item of a higher level than the character can Craft. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.705,r=0.470,b=0.847), with ID f61c8b31-6ea7-4dd2-9d9f-84a51308dd0b -->

Earn Income  
You set the task level when someone tries to Earn Income. The highest-level task available is usually the same as the level of the settlement where the character is located.

to find tasks of levels 8-10, and to the largest cities in the

that. Some locations might have higher-level tasks
available based on the nature of the settlement. A major

with a vibrant arts scene might have higher-level tasks
for Performance, and so on. The Earn Income Tasks <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.801,r=0.860,b=0.940), with ID 94e27531-6d3b-4b8d-8832-31fee149f826 -->

## DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF LORE
Lore skills are one of the most specialized aspects of Pathfinder, but they require GM oversight, particularly in determining which Lore subcategories are acceptable for player characters to select. A Lore subcategory represents a narrow focus, and thus it shouldn’t replace all or even most of an entire skill, nor should it convey vast swaths of information. For example, a single Lore subcategory doesn’t cover all religions—that’s covered by the Religion skill—but a character could have a Lore subcategory that covers a single deity. One Lore subcategory won’t cover an entire country or all of history, but it could cover a city, an ancient civilization, or one aspect of a modern country, like Taldan History Lore. A single Lore subcategory couldn’t cover the entire multiverse, but it could cover a whole plane (other than the Universe). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.074,r=0.512,b=0.355), with ID 962a3f13-3eb5-4f04-b166-f0fee7d97ff7 -->

table on page 47 includes some ideas for suitable tasks.
If someone is trying to use a particularly obscure skill,
they might have trouble finding tasks of an ideal level, or
any at all—no one in most settlements is clamoring for
the expertise of someone with Troll Lore. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.370,r=0.515,b=0.448), with ID 699d8226-e303-4f08-8c4d-3c0416252817 -->

Once the PC has decided on a particular level of task from those available, use the DC for that level. You might adjust the DC to be more difficult if there’s inclement weather during an outdoor job, a rowdy audience for a performance, or the like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.448,r=0.515,b=0.527), with ID bf72e168-1dd8-495f-a439-62a71230a643 -->

Gather Information  
To set the DC to Gather Information, use a simple DC representing the availability of information about the subject. Adjust the DC upward if the PC Gathering Information seeks in-depth information. For example, if a character wants to Gather Information about a visiting caravan, you might decide that a common person wouldn’t know much about it, but any merchant or guard would, so learning basic facts uses the simple DC for trained proficiency. A caravan leader’s name is superficial, so discovering it might be DC 15 (the simple trained DC). Learning the identity of the leader’s employers, however, might be DC 20 if the employers are more obscure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.536,r=0.515,b=0.755), with ID 71bc5156-3567-4198-b714-579e0efcb314 -->

Identify Magic, Identify Alchemy, or Learn a Spell  
The DC to Identify Magic, Identify Alchemy, or Learn a Spell is usually the DC listed for the spell’s rank or the item’s level, adjusted for its rarity. A very strange item or phenomenon usually uses a higher DC adjustment. For a cursed item or certain illusory items, you can use an incredibly hard DC to increase the chance of misidentification. If someone has already identified the spell or item, it’s best to either let them automatically identify it or apply an easy or very easy adjustment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.765,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID 32b5861a-94c2-46b1-bf40-a10b24567e42 -->

Recall Knowledge  
On most topics, you can use simple DCs for checks to Recall Knowledge. For a check about a specific creature, trap, or other subject with a level, use a level-based DC (adjusting for rarity as needed). You might adjust the difficulty down, maybe even drastically, if the subject is especially notorious or famed. Knowing simple tales about an infamous dragon’s exploits, for example, might be incredibly easy for the dragon’s level, or even just a simple trained DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.075,r=0.907,b=0.236), with ID dcde3834-a1f5-4709-9b5c-79cfa0bb3e16 -->

Alternative Skills
As noted in the action’s description, a character might attempt to Recall Knowledge using a different skill than the ones listed as the default options. If the skill is highly applicable, like using Medicine to identify a medicinal tonic, you probably don’t need to adjust the DC. If its relevance is a stretch, adjust the DC upward as described in Adjusting Difficulty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.245,r=0.906,b=0.373), with ID 899e17ee-dd9d-418f-a0c1-0d2eb93d15ca -->

Additional Knowledge  
Sometimes a character might want to follow up on a check to Recall Knowledge, rolling another check to discover more information. After a success, further uses of Recall Knowledge can yield more information, but you should adjust the difficulty to be higher for each attempt. Once a character has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed a check, further attempts are fruitless—the character has recalled everything they know about the subject. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.383,r=0.906,b=0.541), with ID 349735d6-1558-480e-ba65-e4ba16fd2487 -->

Creature Identification  
A character who successfully identifies a creature learns one of its best-known attributes—such as a hydra’s head regrowth (and the fact that it can be stopped by acid or fire) or a manticore’s tail spikes. On a critical success, the character also learns something subtler, like a weakness that’s not obvious or the trigger for one of the creature’s reactions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.553,r=0.905,b=0.677), with ID ee4dbb9c-4a75-4bae-b5ef-3804885c3e0d -->

The skill used to identify a creature usually depends
on that creature’s trait, as shown on the Creature
Identification Skills table, but you have leeway on which
skills apply. For instance, hags are humanoids but have
a strong connection to occult spells and live outside
society, so you might allow a character to use Occultism
to identify them without any DC adjustment and make
using Society harder. Lore skills can also be used to
identify a specific creature. Using the applicable Lore
usually has an easy or very easy DC (before adjusting
for rarity). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.679,r=0.905,b=0.847), with ID c789daca-7fef-4d74-91ee-a4448f5eaa1e -->

Sense Direction  
Pick the most appropriate simple DC when someone uses Survival to Sense Direction. This is usually the trained DC in normal wilderness, expert in deep forests or underground, master in featureless or tricky <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.859,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 1304680f-9870-4b61-9787-65644686f8bc -->

Social Skills  
When a character uses Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance to influence or impress someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, estimate the level of the creature and use that DC. A commoner is usually level 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It often makes sense to adjust the DC based on the target’s attitude for Deception, Diplomacy, or Performance, making the DC easy for a friendly creature, very easy for a helpful one, hard for an unfriendly one, or very hard for a hostile one. You might adjust the DC further or differently based on the PC’s goal; for instance, the DC to Request something an indifferent NPC is fundamentally opposed to might be incredibly hard or impossible, and it might be easy to convince an unfriendly creature to do something it already wants to do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.489,r=0.472,b=0.756), with ID 39963cd8-065d-442b-af74-20c847557ede -->

**Subsist**  
A simple DC is usually sufficient for the Subsist action, with a trained DC for a typical situation. Use the disposition of the environment or city as a guide; an environment with scarce resources or a city with little tolerance for transience might require an expert or higher DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.766,r=0.470,b=0.879), with ID 9c02d11a-7772-4a74-8ba5-a579500a8701 -->

Track  
Often when a PC uses Survival to Track, you can pick a simple DC and adjust it based on the circumstances. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.888,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID 4eb18c36-f837-4b81-a4b1-cdc310191682 -->

RECALL KNOWLEDGE CONSIDERATIONS
Use the following advice.
  “What is it?”: For the basic information referred to in Recall Knowledge, you’ll typically want to answer with a sentence that includes a name, type or category, and some basic context. You have lots of freedom, and players will rarely complain about getting too much detail.
Examples: “This statue represents Shelyn, the Eternal Rose, goddess of art, beauty, love, and music.” “The merchant is a boggard, an amphibious humanoid with a froglike appearance.” “The letter is postmarked from Magnimar, a city-state in Varisia famous for its ancient monuments.” “This magic is geas, a ritual that binds a creature to perform or refrain from a certain act.” Often, the answer you need is summarized in a sentence within the subject’s description or stat block! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.494,t=0.078,r=0.851,b=0.340), with ID 36a982ac-1c55-4336-8264-09ff3fe290cb -->

**Redirection:** You can freely make suggestions to a player if they seem stumped on what to ask or think of a question unlikely to be relevant. If they have a question they really want to ask, find a way to make the answer interesting even if you don’t think the knowledge will be useful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.340,r=0.850,b=0.433), with ID 049ebefa-b989-4722-a53d-dcb93512cf89 -->

Adventure Details: Published adventures often include a piece of information characters can discover if they Recall Knowledge. A player doesn’t need to ask the perfect question in order to get this knowledge! Feel free to feed it to them on any check to Recall Knowledge that hits the DC, often in addition to an answer to their original question. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.433,r=0.849,b=0.540), with ID 98e30b30-40a1-4ea5-a0c4-da04c68fdc2b -->

**General vs. Unique:** Some elements, such as creatures or items, might require you to draw a distinction between a general concept and a unique individual, such as “pirates” vs. “Tessa Fairwind, the Hurricane Queen” or “a harrow deck” vs. “the *Deck of Harrowed Tales*.” When a PC tries to Recall Knowledge, let them choose whether to ask about the general category or the unique person or item, and determine the DC and specifics based on that choice. If the unique character or item is famous enough, the DC might even be easier than for the general topic! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.541,r=0.851,b=0.696), with ID 5b2dff6e-6348-45eb-aaf7-20cba7c5d04f -->

For example, an army is usually easy to track, so you could use the untrained DC of 10. If the army marched through mud, you could even adjust this down to DC 5. On the other hand, if the party pursues a cunning survivalist using Cover Tracks, you might use their Survival DC as the DC to Track. If the character is familiar with the terrain, you might want to apply an easy adjustment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.725,r=0.861,b=0.847), with ID 2c6fc2dd-ef1c-4d57-b0ba-896cbd04ec8e -->

Train an Animal  
Train Animal allows PCs to teach animals tricks. Use the level of the animal as the baseline; you can adjust the DC up if the trick is especially difficult or down if the animal is especially domesticated, like a dog. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.858,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 7e738631-9c85-4625-b7cb-8f4363a673dc -->

# REWARDS

*In Pathfinder, player characters can receive three kinds of rewards for their heroic deeds: Experience Points, which they’ll use to level up; treasure, which can be anything from powerful magical items to more intangible benefits; and Hero Points, which they can use to get out of sticky situations.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.132,t=0.079,r=0.910,b=0.184), with ID 7ee6842f-5fca-4308-9b41-110879468684 -->

# EXPERIENCE POINTS
As characters adventure, they earn Experience Points (XP). These awards come from achieving goals, completing social encounters, exploring new places, fighting monsters, overcoming hazards, and other sorts of deeds. You have a great deal of control over when the characters gain XP, though the following guidelines are what you’re expected to give out in a standard campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.212,r=0.515,b=0.341), with ID a1318786-ad64-4e79-a492-4303c2f44615 -->

Normally, when a player character reaches 1,000 XP or more, they level up, reduce their XP by 1,000, and start progressing toward the next level, though you can choose to advance your players more quickly or slowly if it suits your group. These other means of advancement are noted in the Advancement Speeds sidebar on page 57. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.341,r=0.515,b=0.450), with ID 73e10e85-8455-4c83-9b24-6694d75c3a53 -->

XP Awards  
Experience Points are awarded for encounters, exploration, and progress in an adventure. When the PCs face direct opposition, such as a fight or a social conflict, the XP earned is based on the level of the challenge the party overcame. Characters can also gain XP from exploration, such as finding secret areas, locating a hideout, enduring a dangerous environment, or mapping an entire dungeon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.459,r=0.515,b=0.601), with ID 73ca29b1-c26b-45de-8670-a5c7a0d4063f -->

The party is a team, so any XP awarded goes to all
members of the group. For instance, if the party wins a
battle worth 100 XP, they each get 100 XP, even if the
party’s rogue was off in a vault stealing treasure during
the battle. But if the rogue collected a splendid and
famous gemstone, which you’ve decided was a moderate
accomplishment worth 30 XP, each member of the party
gets 30 XP, too. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.602,r=0.513,b=0.725), with ID 0bd75ccc-846a-4096-af2a-3a2bd46bd4be -->

Adversaries and Hazards  
Encounters with adversaries and hazards grant a set amount of XP. When the group overcomes an encounter with creatures or hazards, each character gains XP equal to the total XP of the creatures and hazards in the encounter (this excludes XP adjustments for different party sizes; see Party Size for details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.736,r=0.513,b=0.847), with ID 9c0a56db-07f2-429c-bb67-17a43fbdbc11 -->

Trivial encounters don’t normally grant any XP, but
you might decide to award the same XP as for a minor
or moderate accomplishment for a trivial encounter that
was important to the story, or for an encounter that
became trivial because of the order in which the PCs
encountered it in a nonlinear adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.848,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 1b74e5af-99d3-4b7e-920d-7c10b0f89f1b -->

Accomplishments  
Characters’ actions that move the story forward—like securing a major alliance, establishing an organization, or causing an NPC to have a change of heart—are considered accomplishments and should be rewarded with XP. Their significance determines the size of the XP award. Determine whether the achievement was a minor, moderate, or major accomplishment, and refer to the XP Awards table on page 57 to award an appropriate amount of XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.216,r=0.905,b=0.372), with ID e2aa4793-c5bb-49cc-998b-7f72efaefb0b -->

Minor accomplishments include all sorts of
significant, memorable, or surprising moments in the
game. A moderate accomplishment typically represents
a goal that takes most of a session to complete, and a
major accomplishment is usually the culmination of the
characters’ efforts across many sessions. Moderate and
major accomplishments usually come after heroic effort,
so that’s an ideal time to also give a Hero Point to one
or more of the characters involved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.373,r=0.904,b=0.509), with ID 88007107-2748-454b-b220-c5c1d0abbea5 -->

As mentioned earlier, it’s up to you how much XP to
give out for accomplishments. As a general guideline, in
a given game session, you’ll typically give several minor
awards, one or two moderate awards, and only one
major award, if any. Try to be consistent about what is
worth accomplishment XP and what isn’t, and give out
at least some accomplishment XP every session. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.511,r=0.903,b=0.617), with ID 1b7233fc-f75c-45c3-a73f-737c21511088 -->

If two PCs pull off the same magnitude of task, they should get an equal amount of accomplishment XP. That doesn’t mean you should allow XP “farming,” however. Part of the assumption of accomplishment XP is that the accomplishment is novel and the result of something challenging. If someone got accomplishment XP for snatching a dragon’s egg from a lair, someone collecting another egg wouldn’t necessarily get accomplishment XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.618,r=0.903,b=0.754), with ID 0152a9f6-e802-4f97-841e-a8a4e1ac4769 -->

Party Size  
The rules for advancement assume a group of four PCs.  
The rules for building encounters (page 57) describe how to  
accommodate groups of a different size, but the XP awards  
don’t change—always award the amount of XP listed for a  
group of four characters. You usually won’t need to make  
many adjustments for a differently sized group outside of  
encounters. Be careful of providing too many ways to get  
accomplishment XP when you have a large group, though.  
Since they can pursue multiple accomplishments at once, it  
can lead to the PCs leveling up too fast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.767,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 846b7abe-5769-4dfc-96d7-cdf98e77c5ff -->

Group Parity and Party Level  
It’s recommended that you keep all the player characters at the same XP total. This makes it much easier to know what challenges are suitable for your players. Having characters at different levels can mean weaker characters die more easily and their players feel less effective, which in turn makes the game less fun for those players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.491,r=0.470,b=0.616), with ID 48e7408c-4853-4074-9561-42a1f1dff138 -->

If you choose not to keep the whole group at
the same character level, you’ll need to select a party level
to determine your XP budget for encounters. Choose
the level you think best represents the party’s ability as a
whole. Use the highest level if only one or two characters
are behind, or an average if everyone is at a different level.
If only one character is two or more levels ahead, use a
party level suitable for the lower-level characters, and
adjust the encounters as if there were one additional PC
for every 2 levels the higher-level character has beyond
the rest of the party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.618,r=0.469,b=0.785), with ID 7490272f-3105-499f-85fb-93edd1104f56 -->

Party members who are behind the party level gain
double the XP other characters do until they reach
the party’s level. When tracking individually, you’ll
need to decide whether party members get XP for
missed sessions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.787,r=0.469,b=0.861), with ID 97403c2e-cb71-4640-bb58-4fe4072edf67 -->

HERO POINTS
Unlike Experience Points and treasure, which stay with a character, Hero Points are granted and used on a per-session basis. At the start of a game session, you give out <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.874,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 743d7f5e-6606-4d07-baa6-547f345d98f6 -->

## ADVANCEMENT SPEEDS
By varying the amount of XP it takes to gain a level, you can change how quickly characters gain power. The game rules assume a group playing with standard advancement. Fast advancement works best when you know you won’t be playing a very long campaign and want to accomplish as much as possible quickly; slow advancement works best for a gritty campaign where all progress is hard won. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.091,r=0.844,b=0.218), with ID b39abe9c-9f44-4c60-92d6-757f38618ef7 -->

You can alter XP from one adventure to the next to get a different feel. During a street-level murder mystery and travel through a haunted wilderness, you might use slow advancement. When the PCs reach the dungeon, you might switch to standard or fast advancement. The values below are just examples. You can use values even higher or lower. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.503,t=0.219,r=0.846,b=0.325), with ID 6d48b58d-b4d4-4da4-be30-ec7673c43e0d -->

<table><thead><tr><th>Advancement Speed</th><th>XP to Level Up</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fast</td><td>800 XP</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>1,000 XP</td></tr><tr><td>Slow</td><td>1,200 XP</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.506,t=0.332,r=0.841,b=0.390), with ID 1e811d39-9482-4fa2-9938-eeb0a6d69baa -->

## Story-Based Leveling
If you don't want to deal with managing and handing out XP, or if you want to have progression based solely on events in the story, you can ignore the XP process entirely and instead simply have the characters level up at story-appropriate moments. Generally, the characters should gain a level every three to four game sessions, just after the most appropriate big event that happens during that time, such as defeating a significant villain or achieving a major goal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.503,t=0.398,r=0.847,b=0.554), with ID b94b91ac-d98c-4aa6-95c1-7a41721515c1 -->

1 Hero Point to each player character. You can also give out more Hero Points during the game, typically after a heroic moment or accomplishment (see below). As noted in the Player Core, a player can spend 1 Hero Point for a reroll, or they can spend all their Hero Points to recover when near death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.587,r=0.860,b=0.677), with ID 5ab3f37c-fd9a-4fef-9643-483a2159ac57 -->

In a typical game, you’ll hand out about 1 Hero
Point during each hour of play after the first (for
example, 3 extra points in a 4-hour session). If you
want a more over-the-top game, or if your group is up
against incredible odds and showing immense bravery,
you might give them out at a faster rate, like 1 every
30 minutes (6 over a 4-hour session). You might also
give them out at a faster rate during a shorter session.
Try to ensure each PC has opportunities to earn Hero
Points, and avoid granting all of the Hero Points to a
single character. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.679,r=0.859,b=0.846), with ID 7b6d1030-9665-4a0c-b524-9f908292dc57 -->

Brave last stands, protecting innocents, and using a
smart strategy or spell to save the day could all earn a
character a Hero Point. Look for those moments when
everybody at the table celebrates or sits back in awe of a
character’s accomplishments; that’s your cue to issue that
character a Hero Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.848,r=0.859,b=0.939), with ID 0b0a2a97-f11d-45a8-999c-5ff9c40c8879 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting a dramatic scene in a dungeon or castle setting, with two characters in dynamic poses near a large portcullis gate.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a dynamic confrontation between two characters in a stone-walled, torch-lit environment.
  • On the left, a figure in rugged, dark leather armor stands confidently in front of a large, spiked portcullis gate.
  • On the right, a second character in ornate red and green clothing is tumbling or being thrown, clutching a wooden barrel.
  • The lighting is dramatic, with strong highlights and shadows, and the color palette features earthy browns, reds, and metallic tones.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The image includes the "Pathfinder GM Core" title at the top and a decorative dragon motif in the upper left corner.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible textures on clothing, wood, and stone.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The armored figure is positioned in the background, standing upright and facing the tumbling character.
  • The tumbling character is in the foreground, angled diagonally across the image, suggesting motion or impact.
  • The portcullis gate forms a strong vertical and horizontal grid in the background, emphasizing the dungeon setting.

Analysis :
  • The scene conveys action and tension, likely representing a moment of conflict or escape.
  • The composition draws the viewer's eye from the tumbling character in the foreground to the armored figure and the imposing gate in the background, creating a sense of depth and narrative.
  • The use of lighting and perspective enhances the drama and focus on the characters' interaction. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.004,r=0.996,b=0.520), with ID df7b9766-1f5b-4713-b890-4253e627803b -->

You can also give out a Hero Point for a less impactful,
but still notable moments. A PC landing the killing blow
on a difficult foe or successfully navigating a social
challenge could earn a Hero Point. There are times when
the PCs’ actions aren’t exceptionally dramatic or world-
shattering, but that shouldn’t prevent you from handing
out a Hero Point as a reward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.539,r=0.514,b=0.647), with ID a334f413-1340-4aa4-8a06-4b7d2c3837be -->

The party could also gain Hero Points for their
accomplishments throughout the game. For a moderate
or major accomplishment, consider giving out a Hero
Point as well. This point typically goes to a PC who was
instrumental in attaining that accomplishment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.648,r=0.513,b=0.725), with ID 9ce22300-9cc6-43fe-a787-6ade2fd3aeba -->

TREASURE
As the GM, it’s your job to distribute treasure to the player characters. Treasure appears throughout an adventure, and the PCs obtain it by raiding treasure hoards, defeating foes who carry valuable items or currency, getting paid for successful quests, and any other way you can imagine. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.736,r=0.513,b=0.846), with ID 03ed763e-37da-4dc5-a36a-b696117d2dc0 -->

The game’s math is based on PCs looking to find,
buy, or craft items that are the same level as them—
this includes weapons and armor with fundamental
runes, and items that help with the PC’s favorite skills
or tactics. A PC who gets the item at that level will
typically be ahead of the monsters, hazards, and skill <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.847,r=0.512,b=0.939), with ID fc6b24fd-9ecd-4842-a83e-c447375d470b -->

DCs briefly, before their challenges start to catch back  
up. The guidelines for awarding treasure, meanwhile,  
have you give the party items 1 level higher than the  
PCs. This means the items found on adventures are more  
powerful than those a PC could make (which are capped  
at the PC’s level). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.540,r=0.904,b=0.632), with ID 91bf4897-ec63-482a-b47d-77609a3c7fe0 -->

The treasure assignment is measured across a level
instead of per encounter because some encounters won’t
have treasure, some will have extra treasure, and some
treasure hoards or rewards might be found outside
encounters entirely. You always have the freedom to
assign extra treasure for a high-powered game, less
treasure for a gritty survival horror adventure, or any
amount in between. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.634,r=0.904,b=0.754), with ID eb052022-1349-43e2-ba07-4022986c905e -->

As you choose treasure, look at the flow of treasure in
the campaign, and see which PCs are ahead and which
are behind. It’s usually best to mix “core items,” treasure
linked to a PC’s main abilities, with treasure that has
unusual, less broadly applicable powers. For instance,
the party’s sword-and-shield fighter might not go out of
their way to purchase an *lodestone shield*, but they’ll
likely use it if they find it. These items should always be
useful—a party without a primal spellcaster won’t have
much use for an *animal staff*. The number of core items
to give out depends partly on how much the campaign
allows for crafting and buying items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.756,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 2f7076be-dd41-4d74-8294-e9d8fa89cb89 -->

- • If there are few limits on buying items and there’s plenty of downtime to craft items, make about half the permanent items you give out core items. The PCs have plenty of ways to obtain the items they want.
- • If purchasing items and obtaining formulas is somewhat difficult, make about three-fourths of the permanent items core items. If a PC really wants an item, they might have to do extra work to get it.
- • If there are no magic item shops or other ways to purchase items and formulas, make all the permanent items core items. In this case, it might work better for your game to use Automatic Bonus Progression (page 83) to eliminate the need for core items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.463,r=0.473,b=0.710), with ID be8e0b48-3eb4-41c3-a27d-953a34a68d20 -->

Treasure by Level
The Party Treasure by Level table above shows how much treasure you should give out over the course of a level for a group of four PCs. The Total Value column gives an approximate total value of all the treasure, in case you want to spend it like a budget. The next several columns provide suggestions for breaking down that total into permanent items, which the PCs keep and use for a long time; consumables, which are destroyed after being used once; and currency, which includes coins, gems, and other valuables primarily spent to acquire items or services. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.720,r=0.472,b=0.907), with ID 8fb19c49-d4ba-4fd3-92a8-f228e36dfc97 -->

The final column gives the amount of currency to
add for each PC beyond four in the group; use this <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.909,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 08de6a54-fa97-4483-929d-ea3740f2df7c -->

only if you have more than four characters in the
game. (Different Party Sizes on page 61 provides more
guidance on this.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.465,r=0.862,b=0.510), with ID e16a078f-a97c-4bcd-8b47-cd8e90d236f7 -->

For instance, between the time your PCs reach 3rd
level and the time they reach 4th level, you should
give them the treasure listed in the table for 3rd level,
worth approximately 500 gp: two 4th-level permanent
items, two 3rd-level permanent items, two 4th-level
consumables, two 3rd-level consumables, two 2nd-level
consumables, and 120 gp worth of currency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.511,r=0.860,b=0.617), with ID 8a761747-8079-4c21-90e7-00042de737fb -->

When assigning 1st-level permanent items, your best
options are armor, weapons, and other gear from *Player
Core* worth between 10 and 20 gp. The treasure listed
in the row for 20th level represents a full level’s worth
of adventures, even though there is no way to reach
21st level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.618,r=0.860,b=0.708), with ID 8f6d4f76-0c90-4107-8c10-1d33dbdce37d -->

Some creature entries in *Monster Core* list treasure  
that can be gained by defeating an individual creature;  
this counts toward the treasure for any given level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.709,r=0.860,b=0.754), with ID addebc3c-0f07-4df6-b8a4-026e6522f434 -->

Published adventures include a suitable amount of
treasure throughout the adventure, though you should
still monitor the party’s capabilities as the PCs progress
through the adventure to make sure they don’t end
up behind. You might also consider making changes to
the treasure found in a published adventure to better fit
the needs of the party, such as changing a +1 longbow
into a +1 longsword if none of the PCs use bows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.755,r=0.860,b=0.877), with ID 849b4f38-48d4-420d-b5e8-8f7226fdd34c -->

Currency

## ADJUSTING TREASURE
The treasure you award to the party should be monitored and adjusted as you play. You might need to give out treasure you hadn't originally planned for, especially if the group bypasses part of an adventure. Keep an eye on the party's resources. If they're running out of consumables or money, or if they're having trouble in combat because their items aren't up to the task, you can make adjustments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.147,t=0.088,r=0.502,b=0.234), with ID 8d8987b0-aad2-4a23-a182-692afa3b56fe -->

This is especially common in adventures that have little
downtime or that take place far from civilization. If the
group goes a long time without being able to purchase
or Craft useful items, the PCs will be flush with coins and
valuables but behind on useful equipment. In a situation
like this, you can either place more useful treasure in the
adventure or introduce NPCs who are willing to trade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.150,t=0.234,r=0.502,b=0.344), with ID 78340ef9-1616-4263-878b-391bef439c14 -->

## Megadungeons and Sandboxes
Some adventures have an expectation that the player characters explore where they want and find only what their skill, luck, and ingenuity afford. Two common examples of this type of adventure are the sprawling dungeon with multiple different sections and paths, often called a megadungeon, and free-form exploration, often called a sandbox and typically occurring in a wilderness. If you want to build a free-form adventure like this where characters are likely to miss at least some of the treasure, increase the amount of treasure you place. Be aware, however, that a meticulous group can end up with more treasure than normal and will have advantages in later adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.353,r=0.503,b=0.570), with ID f8b6ed1c-966c-48ae-96f3-c96c51224821 -->

For a simple guideline to these situations, increase
the treasure as though there were one more PC in the
party. If the structure is especially loose, especially
in sandbox adventures, you can increase this amount
even further. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.571,r=0.503,b=0.648), with ID a2038244-1242-4034-bc3f-6611a08c8e91 -->

things. The gp values in the Party Currency column don’t
refer only to coins. Gems, art objects, crafting materials
(including precious materials), jewelry, and even items of
much lower level than the party’s level can all be more
interesting than a pile of gold. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.678,r=0.513,b=0.755), with ID 141d9ed0-2cb6-4ef2-96f0-7770efb00a47 -->

If you include a lower-level permanent item as part
of a currency reward, count only half the item's Price
toward the gp amount, assuming the party will sell
the item or use it as crafting material. But lower-level
consumables might still be useful, particularly scrolls,
and if you think your party will use them, count those
items at their full Price. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.756,r=0.513,b=0.862), with ID 84cf1d54-bc5b-4e7b-a410-d75194f9e7ae -->

Other Types of Treasure  
Not all treasure has to be items or currency. Crafters can use the Crafting skill to turn raw materials directly into items instead of buying those items with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.875,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID c8395774-5879-4ce1-b912-dbc8877bc688 -->

coins. Knowledge can expand a character’s abilities,
and formulas make good treasure for item-crafting
characters. A spellcaster might get access to new spells
from an enemy’s spellbook or an ancient scholar, while
a monk might retrain techniques with rarer ones learned
from a master on a remote mountaintop. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.080,r=0.905,b=0.173), with ID 0180c449-dd86-4f13-8d3d-ecdf92707512 -->

Treasure and Rarity
Giving out uncommon and rare items and formulas can get players more interested in treasure. It’s best to introduce uncommon items as a reward fairly regularly but rare items only occasionally. These rewards are especially compelling when the adventurers get the item by defeating or outsmarting an enemy who carries an item that fits their backstory or theme. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.186,r=0.904,b=0.310), with ID 65c6f6bb-d3a8-47a0-9979-89315e8326ae -->

Uncommon and rare formulas make great treasure for a character who Crafts items. Note that if an uncommon or rare formula is broadly disseminated, it eventually becomes more common. This can take months or years, but the item might start showing up in shops all around the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.311,r=0.903,b=0.401), with ID 446d8c74-176b-4099-ba88-92ae57d1f5b9 -->

## Different Item Levels
The levels listed for items on the Party Treasure by Level table aren’t set in stone. You can provide items of slightly higher or lower level as long as you take into account the value of the items you hand out. For instance, suppose you were considering giving a party of 11th-level PCs a _runestone with a fortification_ rune (with a Price of 2,000 gp) as one of their 12th-level items, but you realize they’ve had trouble finding armor in their recent adventures, so you instead decide to give them a suit of 11th-level +2 _resilient_ armor (1,400 gp) instead. Since the armor has a lower Price than the rune, you might also add a 9th-level _shadow_ rune (650 gp) to make up the difference. The total isn’t exactly the same, but that’s all right. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.415,r=0.904,b=0.646), with ID 92363fb6-0365-4f46-a0dc-4d17a7ecbe2b -->

However, if you wanted to place a 13th-level permanent
item in a treasure hoard, you could remove two 11th-
level permanent items to make a roughly equivalent
exchange. When you make an exchange upward like
this, be cautious: not only might you introduce an item
with effects that are disruptive at the party’s current
level of play, but you also might give an amazing item
to one PC while other characters don’t gain any new
items at all! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.649,r=0.903,b=0.784), with ID 1e530152-268c-4d90-8453-b35bfd8bd04b -->

If you’re playing in a long-term campaign, you can
spread out the treasure over time. A major milestone
can give extra treasure at one level, followed by a
tougher dungeon with fewer new items at the next
level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.787,r=0.903,b=0.861), with ID 309c139e-217b-489f-9920-a2cc5d630416 -->

Check back occasionally to see whether each PC’s
treasure is comparable to the amount they’d get if
they created a new character at their current level, as
described under Treasure for New Characters below.
They should be a bit higher, but if there’s a significant <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.863,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 2f9b0389-dea6-44bb-8053-e65fe98ce918 -->

discrepancy, adjust the adventure’s upcoming treasure
rewards accordingly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.077,r=0.469,b=0.111), with ID 3282d2e4-26c1-4a66-980f-9b0b6f875f84 -->

- **Different Party Sizes**
- If a party has more than four characters, add the following for each additional character:
  - • One permanent item of the party’s level or 1 level higher
  - • Two consumables, usually one of the party’s level and one of 1 level higher
  - • Currency equal to the value in the Currency per Additional PC column <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.122,r=0.472,b=0.266), with ID d5fad70b-0f5d-49e7-b900-b62fce6aef9a -->

If the party has fewer than four characters, you can
subtract the same amount for each missing character,
but since the game is inherently more challenging with a
smaller group that can’t cover all roles as efficiently, you
might consider subtracting less treasure and allowing the
extra gear help compensate for the smaller group size. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.279,r=0.471,b=0.374), with ID d0211640-a206-4cb2-a7d7-b780c82a624f -->

Treasure for New Characters  
When your new campaign starts at a higher level, a new player joins an existing group, or a current player’s character dies and they need a new one, your campaign will have one or more PCs who don’t start at 1st level. In these cases, refer to the Character Wealth table, which shows how many common permanent items of various levels the PC should have, in addition to currency. A single item on this table is always a baseline item. If the player wants armor or a weapon with property runes, they must buy the property runes separately, and for armor or a weapon made of a precious material, they must pay for the precious material separately as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.382,r=0.471,b=0.587), with ID bde80ed6-6d5d-48ef-b8bc-992623c4d28c -->

These values are for a PC just starting out at the given level. If the PC is joining a party that has already made progress toward the next level, consider giving the new character an additional item of their current level. If your party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the new character less than the values on the table or reduce some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.587,r=0.472,b=0.725), with ID 93e4e7b8-166f-43f5-be30-6dbe946d86ac -->

Item Selection  
You should work with the new character’s player to decide which items their character has. Allow the player to make suggestions, and if they know what items they want their character to have, respect their choices unless you believe those choices will have a negative impact on your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.736,r=0.471,b=0.847), with ID c2471dea-6790-443a-bd58-9cd8ca0784f2 -->

At your discretion, you can grant the player character
uncommon or rare items that fit their backstory and
concept, keeping in mind how many items of those
rarities you have introduced into your game. The player
can also spend currency on consumables or lower-
level permanent items, keeping the rest as coinage. As <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.848,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 4e6c97a8-1476-4f7d-bf67-54293622e953 -->

## Buying and Selling Items
Characters can usually buy and sell items only during downtime. An item can typically be sold for only half its Price, though art objects, gems, and raw materials can be sold for their full Price. The PCs’ ability to sell items plays a big part in their ability to equip themselves how they want. However, it may not make sense for the story that PCs can find a buyer for every item, especially if they’re selling multiple copies of the same thing. Players should not have the expectation that they can sell whatever they want whenever they want. They might be unable to sell items that wouldn’t be in demand, have to take a lower percentage, or have trouble selling items in places without massive wealth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.628,r=0.861,b=0.847), with ID d777c77c-4b88-4807-98b1-1bb4f77fceaf -->

If you don’t want to deal with that level of detail,
you can choose to make selling items more abstract,
allowing the PCs to sell anything for half Price
essentially at any time. Since this makes it far easier for
PCs to outfit themselves how they want, they might be
more powerful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.847,r=0.862,b=0.940), with ID a8b45b3c-c8df-4e6a-b4bd-4307c7b0dfe6 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy-style illustration of a bustling forge or foundry, depicting several muscular workers engaged in various metalworking tasks within an industrial, fire-lit environment.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a large, active forge or foundry interior, filled with glowing furnaces, molten metal, and heavy machinery.
  • Multiple workers are present: one is pushing a cart filled with metal ingots, another is wielding a large tool near the furnace, and others are seen in the background operating machinery or pouring molten metal.
  • The perspective is slightly angled, providing a view from the workshop floor up toward the higher walkways and machinery.
  • The lighting is dominated by the intense orange and yellow glow from the furnaces and molten metal, contrasting with the cooler purples and blues of the background shadows.
  • The colour palette is warm and dramatic, emphasizing the heat and energy of the scene.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The machinery includes large pipes, gears, vats, and a suspended crucible pouring molten metal.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: Two workers, one pushing a cart of metal, another standing near the furnace with a long tool.
  • Midground: Large industrial machinery, pipes, and a worker hammering on an anvil.
  • Background: Elevated walkways with additional workers, a pouring crucible, and multiple glowing furnace openings.
  • The composition uses depth and overlapping elements to create a sense of scale and activity.

## CHAPTER 2:
# BUILDING GAMES

*Game Mastering can be an extremely creative endeavor, and this chapter gives you a suite of tools to make your own campaign or adventure. You can even create your own creatures, hazards, and items to populate your game, or even make your own game world!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.073,r=0.868,b=0.190), with ID 3fa23fd7-da6b-4c97-bdd0-e153c1aa2a55 -->

Where Chapter 1 gave you the information to run a game, whether it was your own creation or someone else’s, this chapter digs deep into making the game fully your own. This chapter is organized into the following sections. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.215,r=0.474,b=0.294), with ID 003802aa-4b6d-4908-8f3f-197961746476 -->

- • Campaign Structure (page 64) discusses how you might connect multiple different events, encounters, and adventures together to create a longer story.
- • Adventure Design (page 68) suggests common themes and tropes used in role playing adventures and gives advice on how to make sure your game is fun and exciting for your players.
- • Encounter Design (page 75) explains how to create compelling and dynamic conflict in your game, be it violent combat or clever social debate.
- • Variant Rules (page 82) contains changes to the base Pathfinder rules that offer a different play experience from the baseline.
- • Afflictions (page 86) provides a plethora of curses and diseases for use in your games.
- • Environment (page 90) gives rules for overcoming obstacles and natural hazards that might be found in the surrounding area.
- • Hazards (page 98) are harrowing traps that might protect a fortress or dungeon. This section is filled with hazards to challenge your players in their explorations.
- • Building Hazards (page 109) offers advice on how to create your own brand-new hazards.
- • Building Creatures (page 112) demonstrates a top-down approach for quickly and easily constructing the creatures and NPCs you want or need for any possible situation in your game.
- • Building Items (page 130) teaches you how to create new pieces of treasure to delight your PCs.
- • Building Worlds (page 134) explains how to go about building your own entire world or setting from scratch. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.101,t=0.295,r=0.477,b=0.818), with ID c1760fb1-effb-4162-b041-34283250b4df -->

To Create or Adapt  
The material in this section can be used as an example for when you actually need to make your own rules elements or adventure and for when you can adapt. Many times, a small adjustment to an existing creature, item, adventure, or other part of the game can serve you just as well as building something brand new. Before you <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.826,r=0.475,b=0.944), with ID 22d810c2-b0ec-4447-8fc8-35fd1824dd08 -->

delve into creating your own new content, ask yourself  
a few questions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.219,r=0.863,b=0.249), with ID 70b3a460-7c21-421e-a58d-0e7c4f6f91ee -->

1. **Does something similar already exist?** Look beyond the surface level. Maybe you want a low-level electrical construct that zaps people. It might not look like an electric eel on the surface, but copying the statistics for the eel are going to get you mostly there. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.249,r=0.867,b=0.341), with ID c01e1eb7-1969-4a7c-9433-1611a8ab1033 -->

2. **What do you need to change between your idea and the existing material?** This will help you decide between using the original rule with minimal modification, using the original with adjustments, starting with the original as a framework to build your own, or just starting from scratch. Typically, creating something from scratch is a lot more work than modifying existing content. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.493,t=0.342,r=0.868,b=0.464), with ID 4cf7e4b5-e8da-4fe5-abd8-13ed7d51fc44 -->

3. **How much time do you have to prepare the content?**  
If time is tight, you might want to spend your time on something with a bigger impact. The less important an element is to your game, or the less time you’ll be using it at the table, the more likely you should modify something that already exists. Unless you’re building your entire game world from scratch, you can usually wait to implement any new rules and creations until you think you’ll need it for your next session. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.495,t=0.464,r=0.868,b=0.618), with ID 097b055c-7dd3-4d07-a127-58f71d7bc0d3 -->

## SCOPE OF CHANGES
It’s up to you to determine how much of your game you want to customize. Many GMs use the default rules and creatures and set their adventures on Golarion or another published game world. Other GMs devise and incorporate all-new creatures and places with strange themes that don’t fit in the standard Pathfinder game or world. Neither of these approaches is inherently better than the others. The most important thing remains creating a story collaboratively with the rest of your group while having fun. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.625,r=0.867,b=0.802), with ID 336e8f2b-1e3b-4621-a8cb-c99b2e7854e6 -->

Determining what your group wants out of the game
and setting makes a big difference here. If you’re playing
Pathfinder with a major goal of exploring the Age of
Lost Omens setting, it’s more likely you’ll use “stock”
elements rather than creating new ones. On the other
hand, it could be more interesting for your players to
see brand-new things if they play with you to experience
your own creative voice, or if they’re experienced
Pathfinder players looking for variety. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.802,r=0.867,b=0.942), with ID 7471cdc1-7260-4a79-904c-9d49a7b75466 -->

Analysis :
  • The image likely serves as a decorative label or indicator, with "63" being the key information presented, possibly representing a score, level, or identifier within a themed interface. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.893,t=0.925,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID ea8db1be-be12-43d9-8a1e-2d6afaa4ee33 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the "Pathfinder GM Core" book, showing two adventurers descending a staircase in a dark, cobweb-filled environment, illuminated by a torch.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two armored adventurers are descending a wooden staircase inside a dimly lit, decrepit structure.
  • The lead character holds a burning torch, casting warm light and shadows across the scene.
  • The setting is filled with cobwebs, broken railings, and debris, suggesting abandonment or danger.
  • A large chandelier hangs above, and a framed portrait is visible on the wall to the left.
  • The color palette is dominated by dark blues, browns, and the orange glow of the torch.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with emphasis on lighting effects and atmospheric perspective.
  • The upper border features the "Pathfinder GM Core" title and a stylized dragon illustration in the top left corner.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The adventurers are positioned centrally, with the torchlight drawing the viewer’s eye.
  • The staircase leads downward from the right to the left, with the background receding into shadow.
  • The chandelier and portrait are in the upper left quadrant, adding depth and context to the environment.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of exploration and tension, with the adventurers cautiously moving through a potentially dangerous, abandoned location.
  • The use of lighting and shadow enhances the mood, emphasizing the unknown dangers that may lurk in the darkness.
  • The composition guides the viewer’s attention from the torch and characters to the surrounding environment, reinforcing the theme of discovery and peril. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.003,r=0.997,b=0.522), with ID 5eb6558d-c88a-4495-9e4f-bc4a270f1b96 -->

# CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

*Each adventure presents one contained story, but your campaign tells a more expansive one. Think of each adventure like an episode or arc and the campaign as a whole series. Though each adventure might tell a vastly different story, they should all tie into the themes and characters that stretch across the whole campaign.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.128,t=0.536,r=0.916,b=0.647), with ID efa3f5f9-0c4d-423b-bfe9-0e7bb6445f84 -->

A campaign interweaves multiple stories: the events
of each adventure, the personal triumphs and failures
of each PC, and the stories of NPCs who appear
throughout. That means a campaign can become
more than the sum of its parts. A campaign provides
the overall structure for your Pathfinder game. As
you prepare for your campaign, you’ll establish its
scope and themes, which you’ll then reinforce in the
adventures and scenes that take place within it. When
you start out, you’ll likely have a core structure in
mind for your campaign, but through play, it can—and
should—grow and evolve. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.677,r=0.516,b=0.865), with ID 71723ab2-c176-4a4b-b079-72463c98a63e -->

Campaign Length  
The length of a campaign can range from just a few  
sessions to many years. Two main factors determine  
campaign length: how much time you need to complete <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.872,r=0.517,b=0.943), with ID d56d8d22-6bf8-4434-85ee-d74d1e5dc4bb -->

the story and how much time players want to devote
to the game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.679,r=0.906,b=0.709), with ID 94b834e6-87e8-416d-8b6e-0d85bbd3c105 -->

You can estimate how long a campaign will take by looking at the amount of time you actually have to play, or the number of character levels you intend the characters to advance. It typically takes three to four sessions for a group to level up. Since you’ll probably cancel sessions on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play monthly, you might consider holding longer sessions and using fast advancement (800 XP to level up). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.710,r=0.906,b=0.878), with ID b3f76af3-d85c-46b9-bf7b-61b5d8be4256 -->

Some campaigns go all the way to 20th level, ending
after the player characters attain the height of power
and confront the greatest threats any mortal could face.
Others end at a lower level, after the group takes down a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.878,r=0.906,b=0.941), with ID 2f043fb3-10cd-473d-af34-a050c3adf167 -->

major villain or solves a crucial problem. And still other
campaigns end when players become unable to attend or
decide it’s a good time to stop playing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.079,r=0.473,b=0.127), with ID 7b9ea5ef-95ef-490b-9187-ba52c8a9aa92 -->

You should have an end point in mind when you
start a campaign. Still, you have to be flexible since
you’re telling the story alongside other players, and your
initial expectations for the campaign might be proven
incorrect. It pays to be conservative when estimating your
campaign’s length and scope. It’s always tempting to run
a 20-level epic campaign with complex, interwoven plots,
but such games can fall apart long before the end if your
group can play only once a month and the players have
other responsibilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.127,r=0.475,b=0.280), with ID 0bfecaf0-1328-4315-b09f-91132ea7ba57 -->

When you think you’re heading toward a satisfying
conclusion, check in with the other players. You might
say, “I think we have about two sessions left. Does that
work for everyone? Is there any unfinished business you
want to take care of?” This lets you gauge whether your
assumptions match up with the rest of the group—and
allows you to make any necessary adjustments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.280,r=0.475,b=0.391), with ID e632610c-7ae9-43bf-a93d-ddfe27699111 -->

# BASIC STRUCTURES
When building your campaign, you can use these structures as a starting point. The Adventure Design section explains various styles of adventures on pages 69–71 that can be used to inspire the creation of adventures in your campaign. For a campaign consisting of multiple adventures, you’ll need to add some story elements that speak directly to the characters in your game rather than just to the events of the adventure. In other words, the characters should have individual goals in addition to the group’s overall goals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.396,r=0.475,b=0.575), with ID 7367f5ce-8bd9-416f-a65c-a13cfc5ead58 -->

One-Shot  
An adventure lasting one session, a one-shot works well for a highly themed adventure using characters or concepts that are novel but that players might not want to stick with long-term. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.579,r=0.474,b=0.663), with ID 43abe964-1d1c-428e-be92-6cd4c08cc4f0 -->

**Adventures** 1. typically a dungeon crawl, horror, intrigue, or mystery <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.663,r=0.474,b=0.694), with ID 5f3f9f9c-c360-438c-930e-6ac6ad198854 -->

**Top Level** 1, but often starts at a higher level  
**Time Frame** 1 session <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.694,r=0.374,b=0.727), with ID 01acc614-61d2-40da-9aba-930db856767c -->

Brief Campaign  
This structure is meant for a brief, self-contained campaign. It can be ideal for introducing new players to Pathfinder and can be extended to a longer campaign if the group wishes.  
Adventures 2, typically one dungeon crawl followed by one high adventure; this format also works well for horror adventures <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.735,r=0.474,b=0.848), with ID 30ed3c83-6ed3-472d-87a2-b0c94b4ddac0 -->

**Top Level** 4–5  
**Time Frame** 3 months weekly, 6 months biweekly <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.847,r=0.406,b=0.881), with ID f3543f22-1249-4b40-910f-da48466efc0c -->

Extended Campaign  
An extended campaign works well for a dedicated group  
that might want to switch to a new campaign or a different <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.887,r=0.474,b=0.943), with ID 24a41896-37d3-4a0c-8d31-ef6152aefaf0 -->

game after a year or so. It allows for significant character
and plot development but doesn’t reach the higher levels
of the game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.079,r=0.864,b=0.126), with ID 2d99db24-3724-48fe-b7a6-cde0891fe06b -->

**Adventures** 5, typically with multiple adventures fitting the main theme of the campaign (such as high adventure or gritty adventure), with other adventure styles for variety <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.126,r=0.864,b=0.172), with ID bd31f587-ec89-4599-a462-ab9bad054704 -->

**Top Level** 11–13  
**Time Frame** 1 year weekly, 1-1/2 years biweekly <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.172,r=0.785,b=0.207), with ID ff3acfa3-660f-4fdb-b8e1-1b5f1bcbcb2f -->

Epic Campaign  
An ambitious and complex game, the epic campaign takes PCs all the way to level 20, pitting them against the greatest threats in the world and beyond. This can be challenging in terms of time commitment and complexity, but it lets PCs develop into true legends, and the players will likely remember it for years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.212,r=0.864,b=0.326), with ID 9df9f486-2327-4a6c-8304-26110bf2c6f5 -->

**Adventures** 6 long adventures, typically starting with high adventure or a dungeon crawl and including military adventure, planar adventure, and romantic adventure <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.325,r=0.864,b=0.372), with ID 1e96a9dd-79e9-4101-be7b-572072d9ef5c -->

**Top Level** 20  
**Time Frame** 1-1/2 years weekly, 3 years biweekly <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.372,r=0.792,b=0.406), with ID 51a42732-4fb3-463a-a134-55b3dd326506 -->

THEMES
The themes you choose for your campaign are what
distinguish it from other campaigns. They include the
major dramatic questions of your story and the repeated
use of certain environments or creatures, and they can
also include embracing a genre beyond traditional high
fantasy, such as horror or paranormal. The themes you
choose for your campaign also suggest storyline elements
you might use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.412,r=0.866,b=0.556), with ID 6585662e-c1a7-40b3-946f-0fdda8f7d3b3 -->

A storyline’s themes usually relate to the backstories, motivations, and flaws of the player characters and villains. For example, if you’ve chosen revenge as one of the themes of your game, you might introduce a villain whose quest for revenge tears his life apart and causes tragic harm to those around him. You might choose a theme of love, leading to nonplayer characters involved in doomed romances, seeking to regain lovers they’ve lost, or courting the player characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.556,r=0.867,b=0.696), with ID 8b52c040-873b-4f64-b81b-ef73fe4da7b7 -->

# Linking Adventures
In a campaign that includes multiple adventures, a smooth transition from one adventure to the next ties the story together. You might use NPCs who could appear in both adventures, a treasure or clue found in one adventure that becomes important in a later one, or even fallout from one adventure that causes the next adventure to take place. Related locations can help, too. Adventures that take place in neighboring regions, or both in the same region, have an inherent link. If they take place in two different places, you’ll need a reason the PCs should travel between the two, and you can use this journey as a short, interstitial adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.702,r=0.866,b=0.909), with ID 00f618ea-cffa-4fb1-9a02-1ad7cf3769d3 -->

Using similar locations and related creatures helps
you form connections between disparate adventures. For <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.908,r=0.865,b=0.941), with ID 9a43c3c9-ff41-4395-b657-ae27efda0517 -->

group at low levels, but as the PCs attain higher levels
and the hobgoblins become mere minions of another
creature, the players feel a sense of progression. Over
time, the players feel like their characters are becoming
experts at negotiating with giants, navigating seaways,
battling devils, exploring the planes, or dealing with
whatever the recurring elements are. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.079,r=0.515,b=0.264), with ID 0bb3094d-4268-49ca-a4af-b13fa082e5e5 -->

Consider how each adventure’s theme plays into the
campaign as a whole. You might want to keep similar
or recurring themes, especially if each adventure is part
of one overarching storyline. On the other hand, this
can feel repetitive, and some groups prefer variety and
seeing their characters play off of different situations.
To convey shifting themes, you can show established
parts of the world changing to reflect the new theme.
For instance, if you’re switching from an adventure
about subjugation to one of mayhem, the PCs could
take down a villain who wants to cruelly rule over the
populace but then face opportunistic brigands who
loot and pillage once order breaks down. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.265,r=0.514,b=0.465), with ID 35de1490-b0be-4b64-beb4-e4c0d6870fbe -->

PLAYER GOALS
Ask what you and the other players enjoy and would like to see in the game. You can use these ideas as touchstones to build off of. When you get into the campaign itself, the PCs’ goals come to the forefront. Find out what each character wants to achieve and look for opportunities you can place in the game world and adventures. Consider which part of the game most closely ties to each goal. A PC who wants to build an institution will need money and interpersonal connections, so you can use treasure and NPC interactions to give them the resources they need. For a character whose purpose is to help people in danger, build some encounters that include people who need to be rescued. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.475,r=0.514,b=0.708), with ID 24f72a97-513a-4ced-96f5-b11a366aba14 -->

Look for good times to recap the state of a character’s
goals and remind the player how their character has
progressed, particularly when something changes in
relation to their goals. The Long-Term Goals section on
page 45 gives you more details on how you can use goals
in downtime. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.709,r=0.513,b=0.801), with ID 21a8ed45-0d18-458e-8288-33edf4253418 -->

# CHANGING THE WORLD
As the group moves through the campaign, the events of their adventures and downtime should change the world around them. Show this through the responses the characters get from other people, the scenery they see around them, and their environment. You might be able to anticipate some changes, but most will come up in play and require you to make adjustments later on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.812,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 113581d1-2848-4c64-8a03-ab206347404a -->

Power Level  
As the game progresses, the power level of the PCs and their foes increases. Going up in level brings new, stronger abilities into the game, and likewise, adventures bring in new monsters with commensurate capabilities. Higher-level adventures should present new challenges appropriate to the PCs’ abilities, such as areas that can be accessed with flight at 7th level or higher. Beyond just the rules, PCs should elicit different reactions from the people they meet as their reputation spreads and they exhibit abilities beyond what most people have ever seen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.265), with ID 7e6e6667-14e9-43f6-91e5-59953f51a10b -->

RECURRING VILLAINS
Consider including villains who can appear multiple times over the course of several adventures. They don’t necessarily need to be masterminds. Imagine an unscrupulous mercenary who works for major villain after major villain. When you create a recurring villain, it’s best not to make them too integral to the story since the PCs might take them down earlier than you expect! Have some contingency plans in place. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.276,r=0.904,b=0.417), with ID dc828f2e-759d-4c7c-873e-2725a763edd2 -->

The advice about Roleplaying NPCs on page 13 applies especially to these recurring villains. As they reappear throughout the campaign, they should change in some of the same ways PCs do. Think about how previous run-ins with the PCs have shaped the recurring villain’s emotions and plans. Which PC do they have the biggest grudge against, and why? Do they bear scars from previous battles? Have they developed a countermeasure against a PC’s spells or tactics? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.419,r=0.904,b=0.555), with ID dd0f9e76-9e00-41f4-9329-aa07728bd5ee -->

## Villain Goals
Just as PCs have goals, so do your villains. A recurring villain might have a vision for what the world should be and a step-by-step plan to get there. A plan gives you a clear way to progress the plot, and an underlying goal guides you in deciding what the NPC does if their plan goes awry. It can be especially helpful to contrast the villain’s goals with those of the PCs. If a PC wants to establish a trade network, maybe a villain plans to get rich robbing caravans or merchant ships. Just like with the PCs’ goals, show how the villain’s goal has impacted the world, even in small ways. Try to find ways the villain can make a difference, even if the PCs are successful against them. A villain will look ineffective if the PCs foil every single plot or plan. For instance, the villain might turn a memorable NPC to their cause, set an institution ablaze, or invade a village. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.567,r=0.904,b=0.832), with ID 8a0409ec-cdde-41e1-bd4c-05646ff51ab4 -->

# STARTING THE CAMPAIGN
Before your first session begins, communicate back and forth with the players about the following details to make sure you’ve planned your campaign to fit their preferences, then recap and communicate your final decisions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.843,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 0646d179-df7e-4ddb-ad8e-d192925bb307 -->

- • Establish the expected schedule and, generally, how long you expect the campaign to last. It’s okay if you don’t know the total length for sure, but you should still give an estimate.
- • Inform the players when and where the first session will take place, what they should prepare in advance, and what materials to bring. If you’re running a session zero to create characters first (page 9), let them know. You might also need to tell them whether to bring food, drinks, and other supplies beyond what they’ll use for the game itself.
- • Let the players of know any restrictions or extra options for character building. Even if you plan to run a session zero, give them a heads-up before the session starts.
- • Tell the players where in the game world the first session will take place.
- • Give the players a basic idea of the genre or theme. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.101,t=0.078,r=0.475,b=0.375), with ID c73f7175-cc2f-4272-b4bc-618ff20274cc -->

- • Recap the basics of the campaign you established earlier, particularly where it starts and any themes you feel will be important for the players to understand as they roleplay.
- • Have the players introduce their characters. If they have detailed backstories, it’s usually best that they start out just describing what the other PCs could learn from first impressions. If they want to go deeper into their backstory during play, they can do so later.
- • Ask questions about the characters. Note down anything you think will be significant, so you can adjust your plans for later sessions. You’ll want to keep doing this throughout play.
- • Begin the adventure using the Starting a Session steps on page 11. For your first adventure, find a good place for the PCs to meet and a reason for them to be together. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.381,r=0.476,b=0.742), with ID 92c4460b-dab8-4c5b-a0c7-f49e2af73973 -->

Starting at a Higher Level  
A typical campaign starts at 1st level, but you can start at a higher level if you choose. This can be especially satisfying for a one-shot or short campaign, or if your group wants to play a specific adventure made for higher-level groups. The PCs should all start at the same level. They simply make a 1st-level character, then level it up the number of times needed to reach the starting level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.748,r=0.474,b=0.893), with ID 848a68e0-ab80-4642-9d43-138045793e70 -->

The Character Wealth table on page 61 indicates
how much currency and what common items of various
levels the character should start with. Let the players <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.892,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID 7955b8ec-d9d1-4aaf-b7c3-6dcd61029cc2 -->

choose their own items as well as spend their currency  
on common items if they choose. This table gives them  
fewer items than they might have had if they’d gained  
items through adventuring, but it balances the fact that  
they can choose what items they want. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.077,r=0.865,b=0.161), with ID c0d39a3d-712b-4934-94e8-5a299980eafd -->

# Ending the Campaign
A campaign might have a well-planned, emotionally resonant ending that executes perfectly, or the group might die in a ridiculous fashion at the worst time possible. It’s important that the ending follows the story, wherever it has gone, even if it doesn’t match the idea you had in your head at the start. Check in with your group, especially when you’re getting close to the end of each adventure, to see how long they want the campaign to go on. Check in with yourself, too, and express your opinion to the other players. Ideally, you know at least a session in advance that the end is coming, allowing you to prepare for a thrilling conclusion. You might plan for the final session’s gameplay to be a bit shorter—possibly just one big showdown—to allow time for an epilogue and for the group to reminisce and decompress at the end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.166,r=0.866,b=0.433), with ID 80b2ca12-4cc0-4530-84b1-eaa49a244a75 -->

An epilogue can make the end of a campaign more
fulfilling. First, let the group finish out their roleplaying in
the final moments of the adventure until they’re content.
Then tell the group the results of what they accomplished
in broad terms, with concrete details of what happens
to certain places or allied NPCs. Ask the players what
their characters do after the adventure. You might want
to narrate a few short scenes. When your epilogue is done,
thank everyone for playing. If the campaign ended in
success for the PCs, give yourselves a round of applause.
A victorious ending warrants celebration! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.434,r=0.867,b=0.604), with ID 536fbc33-6b3a-4fef-bc77-1dbc0f09666f -->

Dealing with Failure  
If a campaign ends prematurely, get a sense from the players about whether they want to continue. The advice on Total Party Kills on page 33 should be helpful. If the campaign ended in a stranger way than a total party kill—say, a PC handing over the powerful relic the villain needed to complete a master plan—you can still look for ways the campaign might continue. Maybe the PCs struggle to survive in the world after the calamity, or maybe they have just enough time to still be able to stop the plan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.610,r=0.868,b=0.788), with ID 89e13d19-1c3b-4fc8-830d-97fa7a3cb49d -->

The Next Campaign  
If the group plays another campaign in the same world that takes place after your previous campaign, think through the repercussions of the last campaign and change the world as needed. You might introduce new elements into the world that call back to the previous campaign: newly powerful factions, new settlements, or new options for player characters, such as backgrounds, all based on the impact the previous PCs made on the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.793,r=0.867,b=0.945), with ID 4e7bed46-fbea-466b-a37d-c30030a8dafc -->

# ADVENTURE DESIGN

*Creating an adventure for your players can be one of the most fulfilling parts of being a GM. This is much more challenging than using a published one but lets you express yourself, be even more creative, and tailor the game directly to the players and their characters.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.076,r=0.906,b=0.163), with ID 8f04b646-70b6-4c4a-8731-8606df1dd5b2 -->

Adventure plotting can start at many different points.
You might begin with a particular antagonist, then
construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme
and leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could
start with an interesting location for exploration, then
populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate
to the setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.202,r=0.514,b=0.310), with ID b6d57b52-6a44-44a2-a04d-9661f5d07292 -->

# Player Motivations
One of your most important and rewarding tasks is getting to know your players and what makes them tick, then implementing plot hooks that speak to their motivations. If your players all like similar things (maybe they all like epic storylines or all prefer tactical combat), your job will be a bit easier. For most groups, there’s a mix, and you’ll want to put in a detailed NPC who appeals to one player’s love of social scenes, a powerful villain to engage a player who loves stories of winning against overwhelming odds, and exotic animals that attract a player who’s into having animal friends. If you’re not sure what your players enjoy, ask them in advance what they’d like to see in the game! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.322,r=0.514,b=0.540), with ID 6ecd69fe-f107-4d4f-8dae-28cb4d4260a2 -->

Considering player motivations doesn’t mean assuming
you know what the players or their characters will do!
It can be risky to expect PCs to react in certain ways or
take certain paths. Knowing their motivations gives you
a way to put in elements you expect will appeal to your
players, but their decisions will still take the adventure in
unexpected directions. The important thing is getting the
players engaged, not predicting the future. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.541,r=0.513,b=0.664), with ID 680a0515-13ee-41a4-9df8-24f9301b1191 -->

## THEME AND FEELING
Think about the emotional and thematic touchstones you want to hit during play. Good games elicit strong emotions, and planning for them can give an emotional arc to an adventure in addition to the narrative arc. Consider what you want players to feel as they play. Is it triumph? Dread? Sadness? Optimism? None of these will be the only emotions to come out, but they'll inform how you build the settings and NPCs. Adventure Recipes gives steps to effectively implement theme and feeling. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.674,r=0.513,b=0.833), with ID f9ff5e0f-c463-4a0e-bbdd-214aa463c7d0 -->

## Keeping it Varied
You can give players variety through the types of challenges the group faces (combat, social, problem-solving, and so on), the locations they explore, the NPCs they meet, the monsters they face, and the treasure they acquire. Even if you’re building an enclosed dungeon, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.843,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 27b0e54a-2552-420e-9352-b5686bd223bd -->

you don’t want to place a combat in every room, or

exploration will quickly become stale. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.205,r=0.903,b=0.234), with ID 37f0e9bf-24d1-4e4f-9d99-0728019211fd -->

Think in terms of sessions. If your group gets through
five scenes per session, how do you make one game
session feel different from another? Maybe two of the
scenes in each are fairly basic combat encounters, but
if you make the other scenes significantly different, or
even if you set the encounters in different environments,
the sessions won’t feel repetitive. Also think about the
tools used to solve each situation. Maybe one requires
complex negotiations, another brute force, and a third
sneaking about. Aim to give everybody something
compelling, and ideally targeted at their motivations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.235,r=0.903,b=0.402), with ID 94625e46-6aa9-4cc6-9c26-0aef8681cbb3 -->

# ADVENTURE RECIPES
These procedures help you build an adventure skeleton or outline. You’ll then go through and flesh out the details of the adventure, including adversaries and locations. As you play, you’ll keep adjusting to fit the events of the game. Anything you haven’t already introduced can be changed as needed. Just like with any recipe, you’re meant to adjust the details to fit your group’s preferences. You might stray far from your starting point, and that’s OK! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.415,r=0.904,b=0.570), with ID f8ce3bf4-335d-4a86-a7ef-ce0e62ab1d38 -->

## ADVENTURE RESEARCH
In addition to the advice and adventure recipes detailed here, reading other adventures is a great way to get ideas, whether they're published adventures or ones your friends have written. You can borrow ideas and structures if they work for your game and tweak as needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.496,t=0.091,r=0.852,b=0.189), with ID 428d07e8-45f2-4d31-98a8-54ba16941895 -->

You don’t need to go into the same level of detail you’d see in a published adventure. You might be able to get by with just an outline, some bullet points for each NPC, a breakdown of encounters, and a few rough maps. Or maybe for your style of running games, you prefer to have some text written about each scene, or even particular lines of dialogue. If you’re creating your first adventure, it can be good to write out a little more than you need. Just keep in mind that things might change in play. If you prepared more than you actually used, that’s normal! Detailing NPCs or locations in particular can be useful, especially if they’re going to appear again. But in many of these cases, you’ll add details at the table and can jot down those notes for later. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.497,t=0.188,r=0.853,b=0.404), with ID 763a3a83-f922-41de-8fff-c003d4aca81e -->

## RUNNING YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
It's often easier to run an adventure you made yourself, but that's not true for everybody. If you notice as you run your adventure that your notes don't have enough for you to go on, you can be more thorough next time. And if something ended up inconsistent, there's nothing wrong with telling your players you want to revise something you previously said. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.413,r=0.852,b=0.541), with ID 37d46165-1fb5-466f-81d0-145e977eb291 -->

Because this is your own creation, it's closer to your heart. If the adventure doesn't go well, it can sting. Sometimes this is because of random chance, sometimes due to unforeseen decisions, and occasionally because you made a mistake. Those are all normal parts of the game! One of the things you'll internalize the more you run games is that you're a part of the creative process and don't need to be perfect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.542,r=0.853,b=0.667), with ID b6ffa9b2-fd94-40ee-80f8-2bf2dfe10de4 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting a dramatic confrontation between a heavily armored undead or monstrous warrior and two heroic figures bathed in radiant light.

illustration:
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a battle scene featuring a large, green-skinned, armored creature wielding a massive sword, facing off against two humanoid figures.
  • The two humanoid figures are holding hands and are enveloped in a golden, radiant light that appears to repel or harm the creature.
  • The left figure is dressed in dark, form-fitting armor with red accents and pale skin, possibly an elf or similar fantasy race.
  • The right figure is adorned in ornate, gold-trimmed robes with a blue cape, holding a staff, and is the source of the radiant light.
  • The background is filled with golden rays emanating from the heroic figures, creating a strong contrast with the darker tones of the creature and its armor.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses a high-contrast color palette: golds and yellows for the light, dark greens and purples for the creature, and blues and reds for the heroes' attire.
  • The composition is dynamic, with diagonal lines created by the creature's sword and the rays of light.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The armored creature occupies the left foreground, recoiling backward as if struck by the light.
  • The two heroes are positioned to the right, slightly elevated and central, with the light radiating outward from them.
  • The scene uses a rule-of-thirds composition, with the main action centered and the dramatic lighting drawing the viewer's eye to the heroes.

Analysis : 
  • The illustration conveys a moment of magical or divine intervention, with the heroes using a powerful light-based ability to repel or defeat the monstrous foe.
  • The use of color and lighting emphasizes the contrast between good (light, order) and evil (darkness, chaos).
  • The dynamic poses and dramatic lighting create a sense of movement and urgency, typical of epic fantasy artwork. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.006,t=0.008,r=0.994,b=0.519), with ID d25a57e4-1ec3-4f3d-b817-cf3815d551dd -->

Roleplaying Encounters 2 battles of wits, 1 grand ball, 1 entreaty before a ruler, 2 scenes of relaxation or carousing with unexpected import  
Encounter Tropes Duels—social or combat—against romantic rivals. PCs and their foes fight only for a purpose or cause. Savvy enemies have strong connections to the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.427,r=0.475,b=0.651), with ID bd14afdc-1efa-4217-ba53-7047485dc351 -->

Threats
Think of each type of threat as the deep, visceral danger the enemies represent. NPCs should be avatars of the threat, whether they’re enemies who represent different aspects of the threat or allies and bystanders damaged by it. Each threat entry gives a brief description, followed by some bullet points you can use to guide you in expressing the consequences of the threat. This is followed by monsters that typify this theme. As always, you can come up with your own thematic threats too! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.657,r=0.474,b=0.821), with ID 9277bfaf-441a-4c66-b442-5baf41ba6ae7 -->

-  • Show the effects of corruption on people and places, especially those closely connected to the PCs. Once-safe areas become less friendly and present threats, allies become unable to help or even turn against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.827,r=0.475,b=0.944), with ID d4f9b1e4-6152-4370-9485-74d26300d643 -->

## BUILDING A SANDBOX
In a “sandbox” game, you give the players a sizable location to explore and let them decide how to go about it. A sandbox doesn’t have as many time-sensitive events as a directed adventure, and the flow of the game is driven more by the players than by the opposition. You can put self-contained dungeons or other locations within the sandbox, but it’s up to the players when and how to visit them or deal with them.

To make a sandbox, create about triple the number of encounters and spread them out among multiple locations or factions. You can expect the PCs won’t deal with all of them. In most cases, you’ll want to determine where the PCs are headed next before the end of a session so you can prepare for the next session. Depending on the size and complexity of the location, the number of encounters might be much higher. Treat each sub-area as a kind of mini-adventure and only loosely sketch it until you know what the PCs’ plans are. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.072,r=0.861,b=0.403), with ID 41bbcfc1-26e3-486e-9499-f877257e692c -->

- • Make enemies subtle; patient; and willing to allow rumors, lies, diseases, and poisons time to take effect. In battle, they might be satisfied to curse PCs and their allies or otherwise inflict long-term afflictions, then retreat.
- • Contrast the corruption with education, healing, and working towards betterment.
- • When the PCs make progress, allow them to expose agents of corruption and to inoculate allies and neutral parties against the growing threat or educate them about it.

Foes alghollthu, fiends, rakshasas, undead <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.414,r=0.867,b=0.575), with ID 3c9356cb-d974-4a46-bff2-170417fbe5fe -->

- **Devastation**
  The opposition wants to destroy or lay waste to a place, person, institution, ideal, or group.
  - • Show the effects of destruction on people and places, especially those the PCs hold dear. Show them desperate, devoid of resources, and psychologically changed.
  - • Make enemies hard to reason with and overwhelming in number. In battle, they want not just to win, but to kill, maim, or devour.
  - • Contrast devastation with forces of preservation and order.
  - • When the PCs make progress, show the slow recovery from devastation.

- **Foes** dragons, demons <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.581,r=0.868,b=0.790), with ID 6928f96d-e589-4a54-ae9b-4897499b1300 -->

**Extremism**  
The opposition seeks a massive change—one they think is for the better. Their violent means of achieving it put them in conflict with the PCs.

- • Demonstrate the ruthlessness of the enemy, especially the discrepancy between their care for their cause and their ambivalence or hatred toward everything else.
- • Have enemies focus purely on their goal. Have them fall back on their rhetoric or dogma to justify themselves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.795,r=0.867,b=0.945), with ID 671af166-d782-4c38-a4f8-4897b09a9a05 -->

  • Above the number is a stylized green and tan decorative motif with two symmetrical abstract human-like shapes and a central diamond.
  • The background is dark brown with green and tan accents.
Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, units, or additional UI elements visible.
  • The number "71" is centered within a bordered rectangle.
Spatial Relationships :
  • The number is at the bottom center of the image, with the decorative motif above it.
  • The motif and number are visually connected, suggesting the number is associated with the motif.
Analysis :
  • The image likely represents a status indicator, such as a score, level, or resource count, within a themed interface, possibly for a game or gamified application. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.894,t=0.926,r=1.000,b=0.982), with ID a54946d3-6eac-466b-be6f-4297667d1b44 -->

- • If something about the extremists’ cause is just–such as preserving the natural world or protecting their people–reveal the foes’ sympathetic side. Demonstrate the horror of what they’re fighting against in addition to the horror of the way they fight it.
- • When the PCs make progress, show uncertainty or demoralization in their foes, possibly even desertion in their enemies’ ranks.

Mayhem
The opposition is a force for mayhem, without any greater plan or long-term goal. It might be a mindless force of violence such as a wounded beast, or a thinking foe that simply revels in causing chaos and damage.
  • Mayhem is easy to track and find, often leaving a trail of destruction in its path. Show how the senseless <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.229,r=0.517,b=0.345), with ID d59de175-6a68-4a0f-a681-6afdc90ec49a -->

Summary : This is a full-body fantasy character illustration of a bald, dark-skinned figure in elaborate, layered robes and wrappings, adorned with jewelry and accessories, standing in a dynamic pose.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a humanoid character dressed in black and white layered robes with tattered edges and numerous cloth wrappings around the arms, legs, and torso.
  • The character is bald and stands in a slightly hunched, forward-leaning posture, suggesting readiness or menace.
  • Accessories include multiple bracelets, a belt with hanging pouches, tassels, and a large metallic ring.
  • The color palette is dominated by black, white, and muted greenish tones, with gold accents on jewelry and belt decorations.
  • Lighting is neutral, with soft shadows and highlights emphasizing the folds and textures of the clothing.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • No on-image text or UI elements.
  • The illustration is rendered in a painterly digital art style, with attention to fabric texture and accessory detail.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character occupies the center of the composition, with the lower body and feet visible, and the cloak spreading outward.
  • Foreground is defined by the character’s feet and the trailing ends of the robe; background is plain white, isolating the figure.
  • The pose and draping of the garments create a sense of movement and depth.

Analysis :
  • The visual design suggests a fantasy or mystical archetype, possibly a spellcaster, monk, or rogue.
  • The combination of tattered robes, wrappings, and ornate accessories conveys a blend of practicality and ritual significance.
  • The character’s stance and attire imply readiness for action and a potentially enigmatic or formidable role. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.348,r=0.529,b=0.947), with ID 08dbae7b-da98-46ef-b08b-37f4e9630c41 -->

- • A single powerful foe is a common source of mayhem, but a pack, herd, cult, or secret society could also be to blame. The source of the mayhem might have resulted from the natural order being out of balance or might be a distraction set off by a different foe looking to use it to further its own goals.
- • Emphasize the cascading effects of unchecked mayhem. Normal trade, farming, migration, and similar systems are disrupted, causing problems far from the immediate location of violence and disruption.
- • When the PCs make progress, show how resilient systems can recover from massive disruptions but might need additional help or protection.

Foes beasts, dinosaurs, drakes, giants <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.078,r=0.909,b=0.327), with ID 7474cae1-2a99-42cc-bb68-d0fd62321bc0 -->

Subjugation  
The opposition wants to rule over a group, location, or even the world. Their ultimate objective is to control and rule.
• Show how groups submit to subjugation rather than suffer the consequences of resistance. The PCs see elements of culture destroyed to ensure subjugation—are religions and churches destroyed, subverted, or replaced? Are lackeys put in place to keep oppressed populations in line?
• Make enemies self-righteous, focused, and in control of groups they have previously subjugated. Fights aren’t just for the sake of violence, but steps towards greater control.
• Show opposition: open conflict, rebellion, secret groups, sabotage, and countercultural art. Give PCs the opportunity to support or participate in each.
• When the PCs make progress, have previously cowed or neutral parties be moved to rebel.

Motivations  
  Think about your opposition, and what their goals and motivations are. The motivation of the opposition needs to match your threat. If you have multiple adversaries, their motivations should all work toward your theme, but they might have different goals and act more as rivals or enemies. Motivations should be more than one dimensional. There should be a reason for every action the opposition takes—not necessarily a good one or a smart one, but a believable one. Be true to each character! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.643,r=0.906,b=0.816), with ID 0a9834f6-68e9-4524-8be5-b80ba9416044 -->

- Consider these questions so you can use the answers when deciding what the opposition will do.
  - What does the opposition want?
  - Who or what does the opposition fear? (And no, “the PCs” isn’t an answer.)

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: A gigantic, heavily armored crocodile-like monster with its mouth wide open, emerging from turbulent water.
  • Setting: Rocky canyon with steep cliffs on both sides, dense greenery at the top edges, and a stormy sky with visible rain and a prominent lightning bolt.
  • Perspective: Low-angle, dynamic view emphasizing the size difference between the monster and the fleeing creatures.
  • Composition: The monster dominates the left and central background, while a group of smaller, feathered, bird-like dinosaurs (possibly dromaeosaurs) run and fly in the foreground and midground, moving from left to right.
  • Lighting: Dramatic, with lightning providing backlighting and highlighting the monster’s scales and the splashing water.
  • Colour palette: Predominantly cool tones (blues, greys) with contrasting warm accents on the bird-like dinosaurs (reds, browns).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference, but the relative scale is implied by the size difference between the monster and the dinosaurs.
  • No visible text, UI elements, or scientific annotation.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: Bird-like dinosaurs in various poses of running and flying, with the largest in the right foreground.
  • Midground: More dinosaurs, receding in size and detail.
  • Background: The massive crocodilian monster, partially obscured by water spray, with its tail curving dramatically.
  • The monster’s open mouth and the direction of the fleeing dinosaurs create a strong sense of motion and imminent danger.
  • The lightning bolt visually connects the sky to the monster, enhancing the sense of drama.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a narrative of predation and panic, emphasizing the overwhelming size and threat of the crocodilian monster compared to the smaller dinosaurs.
  • The use of perspective, lighting, and composition heightens the sense of scale and urgency.
  • The stormy environment and dynamic poses of the animals contribute to a feeling of chaos and danger. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.059,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 3ac668db-24ba-416c-a30f-90effdb5b2a4 -->

- What are the opposition’s weaknesses? How can they be bribed or tricked? What’s something they ignore that might be used against them? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.539,r=0.472,b=0.589), with ID 217e6f82-df85-4a61-ab35-dc65576a833c -->

Story Arcs
Keep several story arcs in mind. Most of these arcs will be driven by the opposition in the early going, but PCs might initiate their own story arcs. Think of what the beginning, middle, and end of each arc might look like. Imagine a logical end point the arc would reach if nothing else changes. Then, adjust it based on events in the game. As changes occur, revisit the end point you’ve imagined. If the adversary’s plan has been derailed, what might they do instead? Story arcs should reflect the theme of the adventure and be well-positioned to show off motivations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.597,r=0.471,b=0.771), with ID b490eb90-d3f1-405e-91b9-48250bbac42d -->

Many arcs will last only for the duration of one
adventure, but others build up and recur across the
whole campaign. Include some of each so you have
variety. This also provides closure, as the players can see
some storylines wrapped up in the short term and others
over a long period. Too many dangling plot threads
can result in some being forgotten or make players
feel overloaded. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.771,r=0.472,b=0.893), with ID 794434e1-bcfa-4709-b12e-4ccd4891312b -->

Touchstones like the ones below make a story
arc adaptable, not too restricted to specific scenes
or characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.894,r=0.473,b=0.940), with ID d40917d2-02d7-48ae-8159-26e4094adf4f -->

- • Use motifs. Use repeated thematic elements, visuals, phrases, and items to reinforce the connection between one adventure or segment of the story and another. The motif can also build in complexity as you move further along in the overarching story.
- • Follow character growth. Respond to how the PCs changed in previous adventures. Their next undertaking should reflect who they are now.
- • Escalate! Build on the previous story and show that the next threat is scarier. The first adventure might endanger a village, the next a city, the next a whole nation, and so on.
- • Bring in recurring characters. A recurring character is especially strong if they appear in similar circumstances each time. For instance, a merchant who travels the world might appear in the campaign only when she wants the PCs to undermine her rivals.
- • Make each adventure count. While developing an arc, don’t diminish individual adventures by making what happened in them inconsequential compared to the larger story. Illustrate the consequences of such adventures so the players feel a sense of accomplishment for completing one before they move onto the next. Each adventure needs some sort of denouement to show immediate and lingering effects of the PCs’ victory or defeat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.538,r=0.865,b=0.939), with ID 6c4f7641-257a-4340-a372-a344388d67c2 -->

Summary : This image shows a user interface element with a stylized green and gold decorative border above a rectangular box containing the number "73" in bold.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a rectangular UI element with a gold background and green border.
  • The number "73" is prominently displayed in the center of the rectangle in bold, dark red font with a light outline.
  • Above the rectangle is a decorative motif: a green background with gold lines forming symmetrical, abstract shapes and a central diamond.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • The design uses a palette of green, gold, and dark red.
  • No other visible UI elements or text.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "73" is centered within the rectangle.
  • The decorative motif is directly above the rectangle, suggesting a header or thematic embellishment.

Analysis :
  • The image likely represents a score, level, or value indicator within a game or application, with the decorative motif providing thematic context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.905,t=0.925,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID f005b8f9-ea4f-4f58-8585-9d9bff971d64 -->

## NPCs and Organizations
Allied, neutral, and adversarial NPCs and organizations can all contribute to the theme. You’ll want most to follow the theme directly, like the examples in Threats on page 71. However, you can add a few counterpoints to the theme. For example, a horror game might include one or two NPCs who are more hopeful, either to grant respite from the dread or to kill off to show just how bad things are. Including NPCs who aren’t adversaries makes the world feel more real. It also increases the stakes, as PCs have people to care about, protect, and socialize with. You’ll often find that NPCs you create will become more or less important than you expected. You can “demote” an NPC if the players don’t find them interesting or “promote” them if the PCs like them more than expected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.074,r=0.515,b=0.327), with ID 1a9c4a00-c34c-4ec5-b59c-2a370573f968 -->

Locations
Memorable settings that include mysterious and fantastical locations for players to visit can elicit the players’ curiosity. Exploring each location should be a treat in itself, not just a chore the players must complete to get from one fight to the next. As you create a locale, picture it in your mind’s eye and write down minor details you can include as you narrate the game. Describing decorations, natural landmarks, wildlife, peculiar smells, and even temperature changes make a place feel more real. See Quick Environmental Details on page 39 for some ideas. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.337,r=0.514,b=0.525), with ID 9f4eac15-88e9-4b6c-965a-333635c0d5e7 -->

Beyond monsters and loot, your locations can include
environment-based challenges, from environmental
conditions like blizzards to puzzles, traps, or other
hazards. These challenges should suit your adventure’s
location: walls of brambles in a castle ruin overrun with
vegetation, pools of acid in a cursed swamp, or magical
traps in the tomb of a paranoid wizard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.526,r=0.513,b=0.633), with ID 04c5ba31-6612-4137-b546-dd1038ec686f -->

Additional Guidance: building your own hazards (page 109), environments (page 90), hazards (page 98) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.080,r=0.903,b=0.114), with ID 80fca0de-65c4-436d-a36a-c5ba95c37cd4 -->

Encounters
A robust set of encounters forms the backbone of your adventure. Encounters often feature combat with other creatures, but they can also include hazards, or you might create social encounters in which characters duel only with words. The rules for building encounters appropriate to your group’s level begin below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.123,r=0.903,b=0.235), with ID 788c3ec6-428a-448a-b6ef-b1227ab563ef -->

Some adventures have a clear and direct progression,
with encounters occurring at specific times or in a
specific order. Others, such as a dungeon filled with
interconnected rooms the group can investigate in
any order, are nonlinear, and the group can face
encounters in any order—or even avoid them entirely.
Most adventures are somewhere in between, with some
keystone encounters you know the characters will need
to contend with, but others that are optional. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.236,r=0.903,b=0.371), with ID a9cc38d6-dae0-40a9-a90b-05eecd9f7446 -->

**Additional Guidance:** building your own creatures (page 112), building your own hazards (page 109), encounter design (page 75) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.372,r=0.903,b=0.419), with ID 8a77f518-a8e6-4774-8907-74bf3bd3ef97 -->

## Treasure
Your adventure should give out an amount of treasure that’s appropriate to the characters’ level. You can dole out treasure in all kinds of ways. Treasure could be items carried by an adversary, rewards from a patron for completing a mission, or a classic pile of coins and items inside a wooden chest guarded by a monster. It’s best to spread treasure throughout an adventure rather than stockpiled in a single hoard. This gives the players incremental rewards, letting their characters advance in frequent small steps rather than giant leaps separated by many hours of play.

**Additional Guidance:** assigning treasure (page 58)

# ENCOUNTER DESIGN

*Encounters play a fundamental part in roleplaying games, but it can be tricky to know where to start when building them. It’s important to follow the rules and guidelines, but creating a compelling encounter goes beyond that. Good encounters have a place in the story, compelling adversaries, interesting locations, and twists and turns to make them dynamic.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.075,r=0.866,b=0.200), with ID d7b615f2-9c86-4e2e-a3c2-10a1b09219d6 -->

Encounter design goes hand in hand with location, map, and
adventure design. You might set an adventure in a swamp
and populate it with swamp creatures and environmental
features. Or you might have a dungeon denizen in mind,
and structure a section of your dungeon to fit that creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.232,r=0.472,b=0.313), with ID bc02fce8-4645-4b65-ae94-5d7045454c33 -->

When you’re starting out, straightforward encounters of low or moderate threat can let you get your bearings. Then, you can increase complexity as you get more confident and as the PCs collect more tools to use against their foes. The more encounters you build, the more comfortable you’ll get with your own personal style. You can always come back here to get more ideas or advice on executing a certain type of encounter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.312,r=0.473,b=0.437), with ID 12ac57f2-85ed-4aff-bca2-25b8150dd55a -->

COMBAT THREATS  
The most common type of encounter is a combat encounter, where the PCs face other creatures. Combat encounters are strictly governed by rules; the guidelines that follow will help you build combat encounters that pose appropriate challenges for your group. Building hazard encounters works the same way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.443,r=0.473,b=0.556), with ID f73ffe84-3515-438d-8afe-b1a09cee2ab3 -->

To build a combat encounter, first decide how the
encounter fits in the adventure as a whole. Then, estimate
how much of a threat you want the encounter to pose,
using one of five categories below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.556,r=0.472,b=0.617), with ID 932afeea-7c62-4906-bde7-1f3020dbd4ac -->

**Trivial-threat** encounters are so easy that the characters
have essentially no chance of losing. They’re unlikely to
spend significant resources unless they’re particularly
wasteful. These encounters work best as warm-ups, palate
cleansers, or reminders of how awesome the characters are.
A trivial-threat encounter can still be fun to play, so don’t
ignore them just because of the lack of challenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.617,r=0.472,b=0.724), with ID 5b99569d-cadd-4455-8f17-462b173c63aa -->

**Low-threat** encounters present a veneer of difficulty
and typically use some of the party’s resources. However,
it would be rare or the result of very poor tactics for the
entire party to be seriously endangered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.725,r=0.473,b=0.786), with ID be98c16d-1abe-4935-b78e-b871ee34792b -->

**Moderate-threat** encounters are a serious challenge
to the characters, though unlikely to overpower them
completely. Characters usually need to use sound tactics
and manage their resources wisely to come out of a
moderate-threat encounter ready to continue on and face
a harder challenge without resting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.786,r=0.473,b=0.877), with ID 237422bd-56b9-4522-931a-36473723bc0e -->

**Severe-threat** encounters are the hardest encounters most groups of characters have a good chance to defeat. These encounters are appropriate for important moments in your story, such as confronting a final boss. *Use severe <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.878,r=0.474,b=0.941), with ID be2fac1e-dd00-4c5d-94ab-5652e7dbfc14 -->

*encounters carefully*—there’s a good chance a character
could die, and a small chance the whole group could. Bad
luck, poor tactics, or a lack of resources can easily turn a
severe-threat encounter against the characters, and a wise
group keeps the option to disengage open. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.233,r=0.864,b=0.311), with ID 5cc84855-99fe-4418-b948-fedc73b5cb47 -->

**Extreme-threat** encounters are so dangerous that they are likely to be an even match for the characters, particularly if the characters are low on resources. This makes them too challenging for most uses! *Use an extreme encounter only if you’re willing to take the chance the entire party will die.* An extreme-threat encounter might be appropriate for a fully rested group of characters that can go all-out, for the climactic encounter at the end of an entire campaign, or for a group of veteran players using advanced tactics and teamwork. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.311,r=0.866,b=0.466), with ID 23ecf336-5596-40f8-860e-f517eabe9f09 -->

## XP Budget
Once you’ve selected a threat level, it’s time to build the encounter. You have an XP budget based on the threat, and each creature costs some of that budget. Start with the monsters or NPCs that are most important to the encounter, then decide how you want to use the rest of your XP budget. Many encounters won’t match the XP budget exactly, but they should come close. The XP budget is based on a group of four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, see Different Party Sizes on page 76. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.472,r=0.866,b=0.636), with ID 42cca137-6fee-431d-a0b3-3a10decca8c9 -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative emblem or icon with a number, likely representing a score, level, or resource in a game interface.

logo: 
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is a stylized emblem with two symmetrical, abstract human-like shapes flanking a central diamond shape.
  • The emblem is set against a dark green and brown background.
  • Below the emblem, a tan rectangular box contains the number "75" in bold, red-outlined font.
Technical Details : 
  • No company name, tagline, or explicit branding is visible.
  • The number "75" is clearly legible and centered within the box.
  • The emblem uses green, tan, and brown colors with a thin outline.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The emblem is positioned above the number box, both horizontally centered.
  • The design is compact and symmetrical, suitable for a UI badge or icon.

Analysis : 
  • The emblem and number likely function as a status indicator, badge, or resource counter in a game or application interface. The use of green and tan may suggest a fantasy or nature-themed context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.926,r=1.000,b=0.982), with ID 34e3a521-2a77-4dd0-b175-1da7c5858f78 -->

- • **Boss and Lackeys (120 XP):** One creature of party level + 2, four creatures of party level – 4
- • **Boss and Lieutenant (120 XP):** One creature of party level + 2, one creature of party level

Choosing Creatures  
In all but the most unusual circumstances, you’ll select creatures for your encounter that range from 4 levels lower than the PCs’ level to 4 levels higher (see the Creature XP and Role table). Each creature has a part to play in your encounter, from a lowly lackey to a boss so mighty it could defeat the entire party single-handedly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.352,r=0.515,b=0.463), with ID 7165deb1-9d13-44f9-aef6-e44c255dfff7 -->

Each creature costs some of the XP from your XP
budget for the encounter, based on its level compared to
the levels of the characters in your party. For instance, if
the PCs are 5th level, a 2nd-level creature is a “party level
– 3” creature, a lackey appropriate for a low- to-moderate-
threat encounter, and it costs 15 XP in an encounter’s XP
budget. Party level is typically equal to the level of all the
characters in the party (find more detail on page 57). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.463,r=0.515,b=0.587), with ID 498c2cd8-a0d3-4bec-9c5a-f5384d75db6b -->

Different Party Sizes
For each additional character in the party beyond the
fourth, increase your XP budget by the amount shown
in the Character Adjustment value for your encounter
on the Encounter Budget table. If you have fewer than
four characters, use the same process in reverse: for each
missing character, remove that amount of XP from your
XP budget. Note that if you adjust your XP budget to
account for party size, the XP awards for the encounter
don’t change—you’ll always award the amount of XP
listed for a group of four characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.597,r=0.514,b=0.770), with ID ad394208-cd75-4c52-9ffb-66b308e69ade -->

It’s best to use the XP increase from more characters to
add more enemies or hazards, and the XP decrease from
fewer characters to subtract enemies and hazards, rather
than making one enemy tougher or weaker. Encounters
are typically more satisfying if the number of enemy
creatures is fairly close to the number of player characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.771,r=0.513,b=0.863), with ID 70c09c46-4c1a-4e80-90cf-1759af6276c6 -->

Variety

Variety in encounters is essential to let players try new
tactics and give different PCs chances to shine as they face
foes with weak points they’re uniquely suited to exploiting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.873,r=0.513,b=0.941), with ID a9df7074-703b-44ad-a11f-4e0add471990 -->

- • Theme: Look for ways to include varied creatures and locations. Even if the PCs delve into a dungeon inhabited by undead, they should encounter other creatures, too! All creatures should have a justification for fitting in, but no place needs to be uniform.
- • Difficulty: A string of moderate-threat encounters can feel flat. Use low- and even trivial-threat encounters to give PCs chances to really shine, and severe-threat encounters for especially powerful enemies. Extreme-threat encounters should be used sparingly, for enemies who match the threat posed by the PCs and have a solid chance of beating them! The adventure recipes on page 68 include a mix of combat difficulties that can be useful to look at.
- • Complexity: Use high complexity judiciously, saving it for important or memorable fights.
- • Encounter Composition: The number of creatures per encounter and their levels should vary. Higher-level single enemies, squads of enemies, and large numbers of lackeys all feel different.
- • Setup: Not all encounters should start and end the same way. PCs might sneak up on unprepared enemies, get ambushed by foes hunting them, enter into a formal duel, or find a diplomatic overture fails and turns into a fight. On the other side, enemies might all be taken out, retreat, beg for mercy, or even shift the encounter to a chase or other phase.
- • Information: Uncertainty can increase the tension and sense of danger the players feel. Ambushes, fights against unknown forces or foes behind battlements, and other scenarios can create this basic uncertainty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.080,r=0.908,b=0.572), with ID f54b00c7-7511-46f9-a5dc-16ac95e6d37b -->

# ENCOUNTER LOCATIONS
Choose compelling settings for your encounters. When encounters take place in a building or lair, the most significant environmental features originate from the occupants, both past and present. Think about their tastes, biology, or wealth. These features could be natural, such as the sickening reek of decay in the lair of a great predator. They could also be alchemical, such as a cloud of poisonous gas, or magical, such as a strange electric current that arcs through the walls and occasionally leaps out at passersby. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.582,r=0.905,b=0.754), with ID e8653dc2-9d30-4edd-8dd1-1a5444af28a7 -->

In some cases, you’ll have a location in which an
enemy always appears, and you can design your location
to suit that specific creature. Other times, an encounter
might appear in a variety of places, such as a guard
patrol or wandering monster. In these cases, you’ll need
several terrain and structure options so there’s something
interesting about the environment no matter where the
battle takes place. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.756,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID eec5f0c8-1059-4da9-9b00-6eae006a9916 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting an intense battle scene between two armored humanoid characters and a large, blue-skinned, muscular creature wielding curved swords, set in an ornate, high-ceilinged hall with dramatic lighting.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are two armored humanoid figures (one casting a spell, the other wielding a rapier) confronting a towering, blue-skinned, muscular creature with gold and green arm bracers and a skirt-like garment.
  • The spellcaster, positioned on the left, is channeling a stream of fiery energy directly into the creature’s chest, causing a burst of flames and visible impact.
  • The second humanoid, in the foreground, is lunging forward with a rapier, aiming at the creature’s lower torso.
  • The setting is an opulent hall with tall windows, ornate columns, and warm, golden lighting that highlights the action.
  • The color palette is dominated by golds, reds, blues, and oranges, with dynamic lighting effects emphasizing the magical attack.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with intricate armor designs, magical effects, and environmental textures.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The spellcaster is on the left, standing with an outstretched arm, while the rapier-wielding character is in the lower center, closer to the viewer.
  • The blue-skinned creature occupies the right and central background, towering over the other figures.
  • The action is centered, with the magical attack forming a diagonal line from left to right, drawing the viewer’s eye across the composition.
  • The background features architectural elements (windows, columns) that frame the combatants and add depth.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a dramatic, high-stakes confrontation, with the focus on teamwork and the use of both magic and melee combat against a formidable foe.
  • The dynamic poses, fiery magical effects, and expressive lighting create a sense of movement and urgency.
  • The composition uses diagonal lines and contrasting colors to emphasize the impact of the spell and the threat posed by the large creature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 62b4ddc4-f130-4a85-9e46-20a70675cfc8 -->

when designing a map are maneuverability, line of sight,
and attack ranges. Even empty rooms and corridors can
provide variety based on their size and shape. Narrow
passageways make natural choke points. In particularly
small rooms, space is at a premium, favoring melee
combatants and making area effects hard to aim without
friendly fire. By contrast, huge areas lend themselves to
spread-out combat, which gives plenty of room to use
all manner of abilities but poses challenges for ones with
limited range. To make large rooms more interesting,
add furniture, stalagmites, or other features the PCs and
their foes can duck behind for cover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.539,r=0.471,b=0.726), with ID b6e1df02-2943-4433-9011-eded76a05034 -->

Inhabitant or Intruder?
In most cases, the PCs enter territory that’s far more familiar to their foes than it is to them. NPCs and monsters who live in an area are likely to be adapted to its dangers, either because they know where they are and how to avoid them, or because they are unaffected by them. A kobold in their lair might bait a PC into walking into a trap the kobold avoided. Marshland may be troublesome terrain for most PCs, but it poses little inconvenience to amphibious creatures. When using creatures with the ability to burrow, climb, or swim, consider incorporating features such as mazelike corridors, high walls with platforms, or rivers. If the foes <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.734,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 9ef71166-ea72-4b75-abcf-0ab368d40088 -->

are smaller or larger than the PCs, consider including
paths, cubbyholes, staircases, or narrow passages that
one side of the fight can use more effectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.540,r=0.864,b=0.586), with ID 3fdd8413-9c91-48f6-a0a0-f4bbae7a411a -->

Sometimes, though, the PCs must defend their own
base from intruders. In these situations, you’re flipping
the script, so give the PCs time to trap and ward the area.
Watching the invaders fall prey to hazards and ambushes
can be a delightful change of pace for your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.587,r=0.864,b=0.664), with ID abd5df63-b99e-42a8-9a28-1cd3c55753b6 -->

Wild Weather  
On a bright, sunny day, the PCs see clearly and fight without obstruction, but adding wind, precipitation, or fog creates additional challenges. Rain creates sloshy, muddy ground that slows movement, and cold weather introduces the threat of slippery patches of ice. Only the most extreme temperatures have a direct impact on the PCs during an encounter, but a slog through blistering heat or freezing cold can leave the PCs worn out and more vulnerable to foes. Light levels play a key role in both outdoor and indoor encounters. Although torches are plentiful, their reach is limited, and lights are sure to draw attention in dark areas. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.674,r=0.862,b=0.864), with ID 555f15fd-6b1d-478d-a5cc-a73e116c4408 -->

Budgeting for Terrain  
If you include terrain that’s tricky to navigate or takes extra work to deal with, consider whether it should count toward the encounter’s XP budget. A fight that requires <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.874,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 7ff7ab50-9ad6-451c-9459-5a5c052a0d63 -->

Climbing, Swimming, or pushing through difficult terrain
can be much tougher—especially if the enemies have
strong ranged attacks. Think about the impact of the
terrain in advance, especially if the battle would already
be a severe threat, or you might kill the party. You can pick
an equivalent monster level for your terrain and factor that
into your budget, or just assign extra XP at the end if the
threat without terrain is on the low or moderate end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.079,r=0.515,b=0.204), with ID b0c26ac1-0e7c-4310-86ff-d31077c77bcc -->

# ENEMY MOTIVATIONS
Every encounter should happen for a reason. Consider a creature’s motivation to fight. Is it defending its lair? Robbing to enrich itself? Following sadistic impulses? Simply being paid to fight? You may realize a creature doesn’t have a compelling motivation, or that the PCs have done something that eliminates the impetus to fight. In that case, the encounter doesn’t need to happen! Your game might be more satisfying if the PCs’ clever actions avoid the fight—provided you award them XP accordingly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.214,r=0.515,b=0.374), with ID 7d613c74-1b4a-4c23-8277-737764a9068d -->

Morale
Think how an enemy reacts when a fight is going poorly for them—or well! Enemies who do something other than fight to the death make an encounter more dynamic and believable. While PCs occasionally encounter truly fanatical zealots or single-minded creatures that would never back down from a fight, most creatures—even nonsapient creatures like animals—back down from a battle they’re obviously losing. This normally means foes fleeing at a certain point, potentially ending the encounter, but if the PCs need to capture those opponents, it could add a secondary objective and split their focus. Look at how differences in morale between participants impact the fight. For instance, after the necromancer’s living allies surrender to the PCs, she might activate a latent magic she implanted within them, killing them and merging their bodies into an enormous undead abomination. An enemy’s morale could even change the encounter from combat to social, as the PCs enter negotiations over a surrender or try to convince foes of the errors of their ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.384,r=0.514,b=0.694), with ID 745b68fb-c9d6-4dc1-a987-04e12d12de27 -->

DYNAMIC ENCOUNTERS  
While you can certainly create enjoyable encounters by placing a group of opponents in a square room with little else, you have numerous tools to create encounters that are more interactive and dynamic. These tools can challenge your players to invent new strategies, inspire interesting character decisions, and make your setting richer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.704,r=0.514,b=0.816), with ID afa25288-27b2-4ffc-b985-6b287d22e1df -->

No encounter needs to use all of the elements
presented here, and not all encounters need more than
one or two. The more complex a dynamic encounter is,
the longer it takes to run and the more demanding it
is. In general, these tools are perfectly suited for boss
encounters, for memorable foes, and as a spice to add
throughout your campaign however often works best
for you and your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.817,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 6e25792f-3ee8-443d-a152-5706aba120f0 -->

## Hazards in Combat
In isolated encounters where the PCs have plenty of time to recover from hazards’ effects, simple hazards can feel more like speed bumps than true challenges. But when combined with other threats, even simple hazards can prove perilous. A noisy explosion can draw attention, allowing foes to burst through the door for a dramatic start to the encounter. Simple hazards can also be an active part of an encounter, particularly if the foes know how to avoid triggering them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.234), with ID a13f6f93-8305-496c-b272-37154d6e11ab -->

As their name suggests, complex hazards are a more
powerful tool for encounters. Because they continue
to act, they are an ongoing presence in the fight. When
combined with hostile creatures, complex hazards offer
the PCs plenty of choices for what they want to do next.
This is particularly true if foes benefit from the hazard.
Should the PCs first disable the array of pipes spewing
magical fire into the room, or should they prioritize
the fire elemental growing stronger with exposure
to the inferno? There’s no right answer, and the PCs’
choices have a clear impact on the obstacles they face.
Hazards in combat shine when they give the PCs ways to
contribute meaningfully other than dealing damage to a
creature. Interesting actions to disable a hazard are a fun
way to give several PCs something fresh and different to
do rather than piling on damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.236,r=0.905,b=0.480), with ID e82c6861-a12c-45a7-8212-ec5e67560ba1 -->

## Evolving Battlefields
While some battlefields are relatively static, allowing the PCs and foes to clobber each other until one side wins, complex or evolving battlefields can lead to far more memorable encounters. One of the most straightforward ways to create an evolving battlefield is with dynamic environmental features. Maybe the floating platforms that make up the room’s floor shuffle around on their own turn each round, or various points teleport creatures to different locations—possibly between two rooms where separate battles take place simultaneously. These dynamic features have some overlap with complex hazards, though they don’t tend to be an opposition or obstacle specifically threatening the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.490,r=0.904,b=0.708), with ID f1e35ea0-5d4b-44f5-bbd7-5f6dfb438102 -->

Similarly, a third party in the encounter, perhaps
a rampaging monster or a restless spirit, could pose a
danger to both sides but potentially benefit either. For
instance, perhaps the PCs or their foes could harness
this third party as a dangerous but powerful ally with
a successful skill check of some kind or by making a
risky bargain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.709,r=0.904,b=0.815), with ID fb61693a-6564-40eb-a9b3-903b7f6c7ae3 -->

Sometimes the evolving battlefield is more of a state change, or series of state changes, and less of a constant presence. For instance, defeating a ritualist and ending his ritual could cause the foes to lose a powerful beneficial effect but unleash a demon that crawled through the remains of the botched ritual, or cause part of the room to collapse from the magical backlash. Major physical changes to the environment, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.817,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 407f3489-5bb8-41b8-958b-15b272bf9359 -->

like such a collapse, portions of the room rising or
falling, or water beginning to rush in and fill the room,
can force the PCs to rethink their plans to handle the
new situation. Sometimes the evolving battlefield is more
of an unexpected plot twist that occurs in the middle of
the encounter. Perhaps the evil tyrant reveals that they
were a dragon all along, or reinforcements arrive for
whichever side was outmatched. Whatever you choose,
make sure it changes things up and makes the encounter
feel more dynamic and different. For instance, raising up
a portion of the battlefield that isn’t particularly relevant
when neither the PCs nor their foes are likely to care is
less interesting than raising up the pedestal holding the
jewel the PCs and their enemies are trying to recover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.077,r=0.474,b=0.299), with ID c680d092-0212-44e5-891a-055410ea12ad -->

## Combining and Separating Encounters
Picture this: the PCs storm a castle. They choose to eschew stealth in favor of a direct approach. On the ramparts, a guard spots them and raises an alarm. The sound of horns and whistles blares throughout the keep as each defender ensures that everyone is ready for a fight. And then, they politely wait in whatever room they were already standing in for the PCs to come and attack them. It sounds pretty unrealistic, and it feels unrealistic at the table. Many players find it far more satisfying when their foes take reasonable actions and countermeasures against them, such as moving to defensible positions or banding together with allies. Taken to an extreme, combining encounters can quickly lead to fights that are unwinnable, so be careful. In the castle example, some guards may come out to attack the PCs, while others cluster around the central keep. Perhaps each individual patrol of guards around the castle is a trivial-threat encounter, but as they gather together, they form groups of gradually escalating threat. Such groups give the PCs a sense of how challenging their opposition is, so that if a fight against six guards is a challenge, they won’t try to pick a fight with 30. When the PCs’ foes amass into an overwhelming force, give the PCs fair warning and a chance to retreat and try again another day. Of course, if the PCs come back after the alarm has been raised, the guards are likely to change their rotations to better secure the keep. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.304,r=0.473,b=0.740), with ID 9ca32bb2-491c-439c-bbb3-5a879cc98b3f -->

The most common reason to separate an encounter
into multiple pieces is to set up a combined encounter, like
when an injured foe retreats to gather reinforcements.
This provides the PCs with a choice: do they ignore the
fleeing enemy and focus on the battle in front of them, or
do they split their own forces, weighing the risk of being
led into a dangerous encounter against the chance of
stopping later foes from preparing for their approach?
An encounter might also separate into pieces because of
dramatic changes to the battlefield, such as a collapsing
ceiling or a magical wall that prevents those on each side
of the barrier from accessing the other without spending
actions to bypass the obstruction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.740,r=0.473,b=0.941), with ID c10279a7-1b08-48d5-b8d7-5823f6338990 -->

## PITFALLS

This section arms you with a wide variety of useful tricks to add interest to your encounters, but you should keep an eye out for some common pitfalls of encounter building.  
• **Don’t Make Every Encounter Complex:** There are many ways to make complex and dynamic encounters, but making every single encounter complex will become exhausting for you and your players. Some encounters should be simple, both because it will make the world feel more real and because it’s a good way for the group to relax without as much to keep track of.  
• **Avoid Flat Difficulty:** Ensure that not too many of your encounters fall at the same threat level. Having some low- and even trivial-threat battles adds variety, and it’s great to throw in a few severe encounters beyond just bosses.  
• **Beware of Unexpected Difficulty:** You might end up with creatures that have abilities that fit well together, making them extremely powerful as a combo, or that are particularly well-suited against your PCs. Compare the creatures and what you know about your PCs in advance, especially if the encounter is already a severe threat by the numbers. Page 26 has suggestions for what to do if you find a spike in difficulty during an encounter rather than in advance.  
• **Watch for Overpowered Terrain:** As noted under Budgeting for Terrain, some features of the environment can increase the danger drastically. Consider your creature and the environment, and see whether the creature has a massive advantage compared to PCs in that terrain, such as a monster with powerful, long-range attacks when PCs are stuck at a distance. If so, you might want to adjust. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.073,r=0.861,b=0.629), with ID acee6331-b213-4df8-980b-936cc5dc6c2e -->

Time Pressure
Time pressure adds an extra sense of urgency to any encounter and can be a great way to make an otherwise trivial- or low-threat encounter tactically engaging, satisfying, and memorable. After all, while low- and trivial-threat encounters have an incredibly low chance of defeating the PCs, the opposition can usually hold on long enough to make the PCs spend a few rounds to defeat them unless the PCs expend more resources than they normally would on such foes. Time pressure is often related to a secondary objective in the encounter, though it could be a countdown directly related to the encounter itself. For instance, if the ritual will grant a lich its apotheosis in 4 rounds, the heroes need to defeat the lich before then! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.642,r=0.864,b=0.880), with ID 511c40fa-4463-485d-ba49-7bf0ecb68f94 -->

**Secondary Objectives**
One of the simplest and most exciting ways to create a
dynamic encounter, even if the combat itself is not so <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.887,r=0.864,b=0.943), with ID 532e0f2a-9657-455a-8cca-f2f489f62e7c -->

difficult, is to add a secondary objective beyond simply
defeating foes. Perhaps the villains are about to burn
captives in a fire, and some of the PCs need to divert
their efforts to avoid a pyrrhic victory. Encounters with
a parallel objective that require PCs to take actions other
than destroying foes can keep those foes around long
enough to do interesting things without inflating their
power level. It also gives PCs skilled in areas related to
the side mission a chance to shine. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.508,r=0.514,b=0.647), with ID 24c94624-3606-4e86-9a99-3dda3131793d -->

Sometimes a secondary objective might present a
time limit, like if the PCs need to prevent evidence from
being burned, either by fighting quickly or by actively
protecting the documents. Another type of secondary
objective relates to how the PCs engage in combat
with the primary opposition. The PCs might need to
use nonlethal attacks against guards who mistakenly
believe the PCs are criminals, or they might need to
prevent slippery scouts from retreating to alert others.
Options like these highlight mobile characters like
the monk. You could even create truly off-the-wall
secondary objectives that require the PCs to lose the
encounter in order to succeed. The PCs might need to
put up a believable fight but retreat and let foes steal
their caravan in order to follow the foes back to their
lair. Secondary objectives are a great way to highlight
different abilities in combat and make for a memorable
encounter, but—like all of these tactics—they can
become annoying if overused. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.649,r=0.514,b=0.939), with ID 75aa43b0-3025-4362-bbc1-6790ac2e3b96 -->

Opponent Synergy
Most encounters assume that the PCs’ opponents work together to oppose the PCs, but when groups of foes have been collaborating and fighting together for a long time, they can develop additional strategies. Consider giving each member of these tightly knit teams a reaction triggered by their allies’ abilities, or another benefit they gain based on their allies’ actions. Just as a team of PCs learns how to best position the rogue to flank enemies and minimize the harm they take from the wizard’s *fireball* spell, NPCs can learn to complement each other’s strategies and avoid interfering with each other. On the opposite end of the spectrum, opponents with poor coordination make the fight much easier for the PCs. Poor coordination between mindless creatures is common, and PCs can use clever tactics to run circles around these foes. When intelligent creatures accidentally (or deliberately) harm each other or pursue conflicting strategies, particularly if they engage in banter with each other as they fight, it can make for an amusing break in the typical rhythm of combat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.078,r=0.905,b=0.417), with ID 9e6827a1-5e88-4b00-acd3-d5fd9f1bb692 -->

When taken to its extreme, synergy can represent
the actions of a hive mind or a single massive creature.
These synergistic components can be creatures, hazards,
or both. For example, instead of representing a kraken
the size of a warship as a single foe, you could represent
each of its tentacles as an individual opponent. Perhaps
the kraken can sacrifice actions it would otherwise use
to crush PCs in its maw to use its tentacles more freely.
In this case, you could model a field of tentacles as a
complex hazard that mainly reacts to the PCs moving
within it, but allow the kraken’s head to act with a few
tentacles directly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.420,r=0.904,b=0.601), with ID a3550fcf-da85-46d8-9eab-fb2fadf5739f -->

Misdirection  
Sometimes, a bit of misdirection can add a lot of interest to an encounter, especially against offense-heavy groups. Rather than amping up the opposition to match the PCs’ firepower and creating opponents whose own offenses are too powerful for the PCs’ defenses, consider a little sleight of hand. For instance, a villain might have an illusory or disguised decoy target with just enough durability to take a few hits while the true villain is hiding nearby, ready to emerge and attack. Illusion spells can allow a foe to attack from a safer position, and possession grants the foe a disposable body unless the PCs brought along spirit blast or similar magic. Sometimes you can even hide the villain in plain sight: for instance, in an encounter with three goblins with similar-looking gear and an ogre, one of the goblins might be the biggest threat, but the PCs are likely to target the ogre first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.614,r=0.904,b=0.877), with ID 96dcc404-4faa-4684-a489-9f50604cd5ef -->

Care when setting up the battle map can also go a
long way to misdirect your players—or at least avoid
accidentally telegraphing what an encounter will be. For
instance, if you always put out statue minis whenever <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.878,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID c5c08744-6763-4013-af52-43c00ac7cbd6 -->

there are statues in the room, the PCs might at first be
overly suspicious of ordinary statues, but they will be
more surprised later on when a statue turns out to be a
construct than if you place minis only when the statue is
actually a construct. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.079,r=0.472,b=0.159), with ID 593787eb-52a0-43f7-9a21-359c85e0c2c9 -->

## Recurring Villains
Not every villain dies the first time the PCs defeat them in combat. Some may escape, perhaps through teleportation, misdirection, or with other ploys. When a villain escapes and lives to fight the PCs again another day, it’s good to have that foe learn from their past failures. In their next encounter with the PCs, give them additional minions, spells, or other defenses designed to counteract the strategies the PCs used against them previously. Even if the villain doesn’t escape, they might have other tricks up their sleeves, such as rising again to oppose the PCs. They could well return later in the adventure—or they might come back immediately for a second battle, so long as there is a proper justification for doing so. For example, defeating an otherworldly villain’s outer shell might reveal its terrible true form, or a previously living necromancer might rise again as an undead monstrosity bent upon destroying the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.167,r=0.473,b=0.451), with ID 685135f1-ce7e-41dd-a30f-c218ec590dfb -->

SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS  
Details on how to run a social encounter, and the  
differences between a social and combat encounter,  
appear on page 31. The setup for a social encounter  
tends to be less detailed. For the NPCs involved, you’ll  
just need statistics for their social skills, Perception, and  
Will. These use the non-combat level of the creature  
(page 31), based on the creature’s social skills, not its <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.458,r=0.473,b=0.590), with ID c7fba8f3-0a34-408a-b340-03150954a019 -->

combat level. You determine the challenge of a social
encounter based on this non-combat level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.079,r=0.861,b=0.112), with ID 424eac9d-78d7-40bb-b36d-f863c261ce5c -->

You also need to decide the objective or consequences
of the social encounter—what the PCs can achieve and
what happens if they fail—and the form of the challenge.
It might be a public debate, a private audience with a
powerful person, or some kind of contest. Just like with
combat encounters, think about the environment, with a
particular eye toward the other people around. Is there
a crowd the PCs can sway? Are they in an imposing,
luxurious throne room or at a city gate? Is the atmosphere
oppressive? Hopeful? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.111,r=0.862,b=0.265), with ID 8c35a701-dcc3-4625-8a40-0658976e78c7 -->

You might find the PCs’ goals end up being quite
different from what you initially thought they would be.
Fortunately, social encounters are adaptable. Thinking
of their likely objective helps you construct the scene in
your mind more easily but shouldn’t limit you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.265,r=0.864,b=0.343), with ID 4c567706-828a-4d00-8e71-af1cb3bf1731 -->

# Treasure by Encounter
The standard rules count treasure over the course of a level, rather than dividing it up by encounter. If you need to select treasure for a single encounter, such as in a sandbox game, you can use the table below. It takes the treasure budget for each level and breaks that down per encounter based on the encounter threat, similar to how XP varies by threat. The final column shows extra treasure you should award if you build an entire level this way. Unlike the standard table, this doesn’t include items by item level, as the value doesn’t cleanly break down for most single encounters. It’s recommended you still give out those permanent items, but you’ll need to borrow from other encounters’ treasure to account for their value. Include encounters against creatures without treasure to account for this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.351,r=0.864,b=0.588), with ID 5821e95d-a753-4c94-ae90-0c0d51e73315 -->

# VARIANT RULES

*While the rules presented in Player Core and the rest of this book are designed to give you and your group a baseline experience that’s easy to learn and fun to play, sometimes you’re looking for more customizable options. That’s where variant rules come in: options to alter the game’s rules to fit your needs. This section adds a collection of variant rules to your toolbox, often with additional options for how to use them.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.130,t=0.536,r=0.913,b=0.664), with ID 6cdbdf52-5722-47ff-b18a-f4829f1302da -->

- • Automatic Bonus Progression (page 83) presents a variant for playing the game without relying on fundamental runes to enhance damage and accuracy.
- • Free Archetype (page 84) presents a method of character generation that adds an archetype to a character’s advancement without requiring them to spend their standard class feats.
- • Level 0 Characters (page 84) can play through the characters’ adventures before they take on character classes.
- • Proficiency without Level (page 85) changes the math of the proficiency system to tell stories where being outnumbered by weaker foes remains a challenge and high-level characters are less superhuman. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.691,r=0.517,b=0.943), with ID d1c1a3f4-e8ee-4fef-bf6b-e67460267815 -->

# CHOOSING VARIANT RULES
When you and your group are deciding which variant
rules to use, think about the types of stories you
want to tell together, including the genre, themes, and
characters, to choose which variant rules might be the
best fit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.688,r=0.907,b=0.785), with ID cf10bd2e-a603-472a-bf14-6d22b1673d5d -->

If you’re not sure about a variant rule, take a chance! Make sure everyone in your group understands that this is a trial run and that you might need to adjust or remove the variant rules later on if they’re causing unexpected side effects or not working as you intended. When you’re playing with variant rules, be sure to let any new players who join the group know about the variant rules your group has chosen. This helps them set their expectations, which is important for making sure there is a feeling of fairness among your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.785,r=0.906,b=0.942), with ID 8dc40d42-5368-49de-92c2-aa6cea3d2fae -->

Skill Potency 3rd  
At 3rd level, choose a single skill. You gain a +1 potency bonus with that skill. At 6th level, choose a second skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 9th level, choose one of those skills and increase its potency bonus to +2. At 13th level, increase the potency bonus of your second skill to +2 and choose a third skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 15th level, increase the third skill’s potency bonus to +2 and choose a fourth skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 17th level, choose one of your three skills with a +2 potency bonus to increase to +3, and choose a fifth skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. Finally, at 20th level, choose one of the two skills with a +2 potency bonus to increase to +3, choose one of the three skills at a +1 potency bonus to increase to +2, and choose one new skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. You can spend 1 week to retrain one of these assignments at any time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.073,r=0.866,b=0.328), with ID 1ef457a6-e3a0-4ee1-ab54-445d8d45863d -->

If your group is playing a game with themes that call for it, you might wind up combining multiple variant rules together, possibly applying several options at the same time. For instance, in a gritty, low-magic, survival-horror game, you might start the PCs as 0-level characters and alter the proficiency bonus progression to remove level at the same time. In general, the variant options in this chapter are sufficiently self-contained, with explanations of how they change the game, that you should be able to combine them without trouble. When you design your own variant rules, be on the lookout for places where new rules might have unexpected overlapping effects on each other and the game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.267), with ID d0369fef-4950-4630-9c03-4ab2f341637a -->

Automatic Bonus Progression  
This variant removes the item bonus to rolls and DCs usually provided by magic items (with the exception of armor’s item bonus) and replaces it with a new kind of bonus—potency—to reflect a character’s innate ability. In this variant, magic items, if they exist at all, can provide unique special abilities rather than numerical increases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.274,r=0.473,b=0.406), with ID 2c2cc7cd-04c5-43ab-a18c-fe97ddc054bb -->

At 8th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to saves,
increasing to +2 at level 14 and +3 at level 20. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.534,r=0.866,b=0.590), with ID 616ecd24-cbb3-49d5-9eff-fbb200bd63b7 -->

Ability Apex                                            17th
At 17th level, choose one attribute score to either increase
by 2 or increase to 18 (whichever grants the higher score). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.596,r=0.866,b=0.652), with ID 52818ae7-1816-4309-afd8-3aad3371c2a9 -->

Adjusting Items and Treasure  
With this variant, you can ignore as much of the Party Treasure by Level table on page 59 as you want, though you’ll usually want to provide consistent currency. The main area your choice will impact is in spellcasting items, such as scrolls and wands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.658,r=0.865,b=0.755), with ID 169452cb-489d-4c88-9ab7-13cc45d4b21b -->

Remove all potency runes, *striking* runes, and *resilient* runes. Items that normally grant an item bonus to statistics or damage dice no longer do, other than the base item bonus to AC from armor. Apex items do not increase attribute modifiers. If your world still includes magic items, a safe bet is to continue to give out consumable items at roughly the rate on page 59. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.755,r=0.865,b=0.862), with ID 9030739c-a300-4ef4-b47c-60d6fe57cf32 -->

If you choose to eliminate runes entirely, this can
reduce the PCs’ damage since they won’t have runes like
*flaming* or *holy*. If you’ve removed nearly all treasure,
challenges might become more difficult, even with
automatic bonuses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.862,r=0.865,b=0.941), with ID 0cc97453-a102-4ac0-913b-34cdf3766069 -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative UI element with the number "83" displayed prominently, likely representing a score, level, or value in a game or application.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a rectangular box with the number "83" in large, bold font.
  • The background features ornate, symmetrical green and gold designs, including a central diamond shape and stylized curves.
  • The left side of the box has a small profile silhouette facing right.
  • The color palette is primarily dark green, gold, and brown.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The number "83" is centered within a tan rectangle bordered in green.
  • No additional UI elements or text are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "83" is the focal point, placed in the center of the lower portion of the image.
  • Decorative elements are positioned above and around the number, framing it.

Analysis :
  • The design suggests this is a stylized score or value display, possibly from a fantasy-themed game or application, with the ornate border drawing attention to the number "83". <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.893,t=0.925,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID 987d3445-1bfb-4ce4-aa18-791efee40d62 -->

# Free Archetype
Sometimes the story of your game calls for a group where everyone is a pirate or an apprentice at a magic school. The free archetype variant introduces a shared aspect to every character without taking away any of that character’s existing choices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.076,r=0.516,b=0.174), with ID 745ad407-d5fe-4cc9-8caa-d6435495bb05 -->

Building a Character  
The only difference between a normal character and a free-archetype character is that the character receives an extra class feat at 2nd level and every even level thereafter that they can use only for archetype feats. You might restrict the free feats to those of a single archetype each character in the group has (for a shared backstory), those of archetypes fitting a certain theme (such as only ones from magical archetypes in a game set in a magic school), or entirely unrestricted if you just want a higher-powered game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.183,r=0.514,b=0.341), with ID 7a5c799e-21f3-4d5b-b9ea-092eae509bda -->

If the group all has the same archetype or draws from a
limited list, you might want to ignore the free archetype’s
normal restriction of selecting a certain number of feats
before taking a new archetype. That way a character can
still pursue another archetype that also fits their character. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.342,r=0.514,b=0.419), with ID 92a1b953-35c1-4b0d-b75e-59d72e24aa53 -->

Playing with Free Archetypes  
Free-archetype characters are a bit more versatile and powerful than normal, but usually not so much that they unbalance your game. However, due to the characters’ increased access to archetype feats, you should place a limit on the number of feats that scale based on a character’s number of archetype feats (mainly multiclass Resiliency feats). Allowing a character to benefit from a number of these feats equal to half their level is appropriate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.429,r=0.479,b=0.602), with ID 42d99cbf-874a-47dc-8447-f0618839163e -->

LEVEL 0
CHARACTERS
Before they were heroes, every PC came
from somewhere, whether they worked on a
farm like Valeros or picked pockets on the streets
like Seelah. Sometimes, it can be a lot of fun to
play a prequel game set years before the PCs’
first adventure as heroes, or you may have an
idea for a low-powered adventure that calls for
commoners and apprentices. The rules below
provide ways to build and use level 0 PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.612,r=0.448,b=0.788), with ID 0b81668f-a771-4dd9-ad53-949ec0e40310 -->

Building Characters  
Building a level 0 character is similar to building a 1st-level character, but you stop after choosing your ancestry and background. A level 0 character still gets the four free attribute boosts from Step 6 of the normal character creation process, but not the class attribute boost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.796,r=0.438,b=0.941), with ID 05a27666-d96c-4f12-8321-e85f4b069e89 -->

Initial Proficiencies  
A level 0 character is trained in Perception, all saving throws, unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, and one simple weapon of their choice. Additionally, they are trained in a number of skills equal to 2 + their Intelligence modifier. The proficiency bonus for a level 0 character works the same way as normal, but since the level is 0, the total proficiency bonus for being trained is +2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.904,b=0.205), with ID a9ff70db-2de9-4388-a82f-4e0774f5580f -->

Hit Points  
A level 0 character adds their Constitution modifier to their ancestry Hit Points to determine their starting Hit Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.216,r=0.902,b=0.266), with ID ad1e2e38-f9d8-4383-a4d5-23ec3f614357 -->

Starting Money  
A level 0 character starts with 5 gp (50 sp) for equipment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.277,r=0.900,b=0.312), with ID 8c79024b-68e8-4689-a0c9-7a6f5d202741 -->

Apprentice Option  
If the story you want to tell is about characters who have started training to become a particular class, you can grant them a small number of additional abilities. An apprentice character is trained in the skill or skills specified for their chosen class (such as Occultism and Performance for a bard) in addition to the skills they gain through their initial proficiencies. They also gain benefits based on the class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.324,r=0.903,b=0.448), with ID 54772870-b479-40f6-b053-b2dc414ffdd3 -->

Alchemist: An apprentice alchemist gains the advanced alchemy portion of the alchemy class feature. Their advanced alchemy level is 1, and they have one batch of infused reagents each day. They can make only infused alchemical items.
  Monk: An apprentice monk gains the powerful fist class feature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.449,r=0.904,b=0.555), with ID ee3a174e-fd54-449f-816f-4980392cd061 -->

Other Martial Class: An apprentice of another martial class (fighter, ranger, or rogue, for example) is trained in light armor, all simple weapons, and one martial weapon listed in the class’s initial proficiencies. If a martial class not listed here lacks light armor or martial weapon training (as the monk does), give it a different ability as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.570,t=0.556,r=0.904,b=0.692), with ID 1434ca92-818a-4f37-808f-fb5fc0e36977 -->

Spellcaster: An apprentice spellcaster is trained in the appropriate magic tradition and gains two cantrips from their class. A prepared caster can’t change these cantrips each day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.584,t=0.694,r=0.903,b=0.755), with ID 3940d7fb-8e4b-49b3-b289-728dea32f798 -->

Gameplay
Combat can be especially dangerous for level 0 characters. For safety’s sake, you might treat the characters as level –1 when determining what combat encounters are appropriate. For skill checks, they can still accomplish tasks with a simple trained DC using their trained skills, but success is less certain. Since they have fewer skills, the party might not have anyone trained for a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.593,t=0.767,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID 5b8547ce-a6d4-41ac-9360-8da61a0dc6e5 -->

given task. If you’re playing these characters for more than
a few sessions, consider advancing them to 1st level using
the fast advancement speed (800 XP). If your group wants
a longer experience at level 0, start the group without the
apprentice benefits, then level up to apprentice (gaining
those benefits and the apprentice adjustments for their
class), and then level up to 1st level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.079,r=0.474,b=0.191), with ID c3022a11-84f8-47d3-ba68-b8cbbd4eb31e -->

Treasure
As the characters start with 5 gp, their adventures up to 1st level should account for the rest of a 1st-level character’s starting money. That means you’ll distribute treasure worth 10 gp × the number of PCs, a large percentage of which should be in currency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.197,r=0.474,b=0.298), with ID 3723c9b9-f46b-41c1-aae6-555f37266dbf -->

# PROFICIENCY WITHOUT LEVEL
This variant removes a character’s level from their proficiency bonus, scaling it differently for a style of game that’s outside the norm. This is a significant change to the system. The proficiency rank progression in Player Core is designed for heroic fantasy games where heroes rise from humble origins to world-shattering strength. For some games, this narrative arc doesn’t fit. Such games are about hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which even the world’s best fighter can’t guarantee a win against a large group of moderately skilled brigands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.304,r=0.474,b=0.495), with ID f9334216-fa07-4548-a84e-f96c864b1224 -->

The initial implementation is fairly straightforward:
the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for
expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. It’s best to give
an untrained character a –2 proficiency modifier instead of
a +0 proficiency bonus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.494,r=0.473,b=0.571), with ID ba81ef1d-3fec-4310-a8fa-edeec198ad76 -->

Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so
on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency
bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element.
These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks,
ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.571,r=0.474,b=0.648), with ID 2e64b8f0-56b3-4a05-8ae1-7b971d1aef79 -->

Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks. You can just
subtract the level from the DC tables on page 53, or you
can reference the Simple Skill DCs (No Level) table for a
set of DCs that’s easier to remember. The new DCs make
it a little harder for high-level characters to succeed than it
would be when using the default numbers, in keeping with
the theme mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to
flatten out, with critical successes and critical failures being
less likely across the game. This is particularly notable in
spells, where you’re less likely to see the extreme effects of
critical failures on saves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.648,r=0.473,b=0.818), with ID c94db01b-6487-48fe-b59c-682580a59e7a -->

Adjusting Encounters  
Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and conversely, where a single higher-level monster is not much of a threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in encounter building, including shifts in the PCs’ rewards. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.075,r=0.862,b=0.174), with ID 08bc39ed-b081-4eb0-be7d-c1e1ce67a650 -->

Under the default math, two monsters of a certain level
are roughly as challenging as a single monster 2 levels
higher. However, with level removed from proficiency, this
assumption is no longer true. The XP budget for creatures
uses a different scale, as shown in the Creature XP (No
Level) table. You’ll still use the same XP budget for a given
threat level as shown on the Encounter Budget table on
page 75 (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for a
severe-threat encounter, and so on). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.173,r=0.864,b=0.312), with ID 503144ad-f1f9-42e4-8b48-44e716b32d3e -->

While the XP values in the Creature XP (No Level)
table work well in most cases, sometimes they might not
account for the effects of creatures’ special abilities when
facing a party of a drastically different level. For instance,
a ghost mage could prove too much for 5th-level PCs with
its incorporeality, flight, and high-rank spells, even though
it’s outnumbered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.599,r=0.865,b=0.712), with ID 7b84482d-8333-4371-8250-a3b48420adf9 -->

Adjusting Treasure  
Items on standard creatures are chosen to avoid giving out too much treasure for the level at which PCs will typically fight them. However, using this variant, PCs might defeat a creature 5 levels higher than they are, or even more! Too many encounters with higher-level foes can wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected, or vice versa if they’re fighting weaker foes that put up more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can make periodic adjustments if the PCs’ treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making it so they can’t easily sell or buy magic items will mean it’s harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep the issue entirely, you can use automatic bonus progression (page 83). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.718,r=0.865,b=0.944), with ID f94e2c96-bb67-4f09-a5e0-4c3777b4154e -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative UI element with a number, likely representing a score or value, set within a stylized border.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a rectangular beige box with the number "85" in bold, dark red font.
  • The box is bordered by a dark green and gold outline.
  • Above the number is a symmetrical, ornate design featuring two stylized human figures and a central diamond shape, all in gold and green.
  • The background is dark brown.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The number "85" is clearly visible and centered within the box.
  • The left edge of the box features a small profile of a face in green.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "85" is the focal point, positioned centrally within the beige box.
  • The ornate design is directly above the number, suggesting a header or emblematic function.

Analysis :
  • The image likely represents a score, level, or value within a game or application interface, with the ornate design serving as a thematic or decorative element. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.893,t=0.925,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID 8e2049c0-3b15-4f5b-a7ab-c6d07c8461ab -->

# AFFLICTIONS

*Wherever there is life, there are insidious perils that threaten the health and well-being of living creatures. Some of these afflictions, including many diseases, are inherent to the natural world. Others—curses being the most notorious—exist solely to cause harm to others.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.076,r=0.908,b=0.165), with ID 3983fba5-aad8-45b7-b10f-7fd2a9213087 -->

Afflictions strike creatures with potent and often escalating results. This section presents a variety of curses, and diseases for use in your game. A broad sampling of poisons can be found beginning on page 248, and the rules for afflictions start on page 430 in *Player Core*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.202,r=0.514,b=0.279), with ID 4061a135-396e-4f0f-9a6b-5e66edb6e1d6 -->

Depending on the tone of the campaign, the GM
might want to roll secret saving throws for PCs affected
by an affliction. This is particularly effective when the
affliction is an element within a survival or horror game,
or when it’s part of a mystery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.280,r=0.515,b=0.357), with ID e7af6bdd-d7f6-46bd-9cb5-7fbb44026e4f -->

CURSES
A curse is a manifestation of potent ill will. Curses typically have a single effect that takes place upon a failed saving throw and lasts a specified amount of time, or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. Rarely, curses will have stages; these follow the rules for afflictions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.368,r=0.514,b=0.479), with ID d1e6ef83-398a-4ea1-87f5-e4f111873c18 -->

Curses may come from a malicious action, such as a lich’s Paralyzing Touch or a spell from an evil spellcaster. Guardians of a tomb or treasure might ward their charge with a curse as protection against thieves. Gods may inflict curses on servants who have raised their ire. In some rare cases, a curse might manifest as a response to a terrible act, such as a massacre. When using a curse in your game, assign the curse to an item, location, situation, or similar element. Then, decide on a trigger for the curse—such as a creature attempting to steal a warded book, destroy a work of art, or slay a specific creature. A curse can even be tied to a specific location, in which case it functions as a simple hazard. Once that trigger occurs, the curse affects the triggering creature or creatures. Each affected creature must attempt a saving throw against the curse; if they fail, they are subject to the effects specified in the curse’s Effect entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.480,r=0.514,b=0.724), with ID 062b81ac-7565-462f-baad-52e6fbf2c498 -->

Every night, you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, an incorporeal undead manifests to hassle and harry you throughout the night, retreating before it can take much damage and often preventing you from gaining a full night's rest.

# DISEASES
Exposure to disease can be a hazard, such as when PCs come into contact with a plague-ridden corpse; such hazards grant XP as a simple hazard of the disease’s level. When a disease gives a sickened condition that can’t be reduced until it runs its course, that typically means the disease has symptoms such as a difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite, or nausea that make eating and drinking difficult but not impossible. Despite the condition’s prohibition on eating or drinking, a creature can slowly and carefully eat and drink as long as they aren’t in an encounter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.251), with ID db39fab5-ae45-4008-96a4-1585f91a932d -->

SCARLET FEVER                        DISEASE 1

# ENVIRONMENT

*Primarily used during exploration, environment rules bring the locales your party travels through to life. You’ll often be able to use common sense to adjudicate how environments work, but you’ll need special rules for environments that really stand out.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.076,r=0.908,b=0.165), with ID 4117c02b-7cb3-4223-84b4-404e13f8cb71 -->

Each of the environments presented in this section uses the terrain rules (Player Core 423) in different ways, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those rules before reading this section. Some environments refer to the rules for climate (page 95) and natural disasters (beginning on page 96). Many places have the traits of multiple environments; a snow-covered mountain might use both the arctic and mountain environments, for example. For environmental features with effects based on how tall or deep they are, those effects vary further based on a creature’s size. For instance, a shallow bog for a Medium creature might be a deep bog for smaller creatures, and a deep bog for a Medium creature could be only a shallow bog for a larger creature (and so insignificant for a truly massive creature that it isn’t even difficult terrain). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.202,r=0.516,b=0.448), with ID ce54770c-2dc9-4f5d-b3f7-3bda2a0e1f52 -->

The Environmental Features table (below) lists the
features of various environments alphabetically for quick
reference. The Proficiency DC Band entry indicates a
range of appropriate simple DCs for that environmental
feature, while also providing a rough estimate of the
danger or complexity of the feature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.448,r=0.515,b=0.542), with ID 074eac2f-e6e4-4982-bda5-5980b9d4a9a1 -->

# ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
Some environmental features or natural disasters deal damage. Because the amount of damage can vary based on the specific circumstances, the rules for specific environments and natural disasters use damage categories to describe the damage, rather than exact numbers. Use the Environmental Damage table to determine damage from an environment or natural disaster. When deciding the exact damage amount, use your best judgment based on how extreme you deem the danger to be. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.551,r=0.515,b=0.710), with ID e69018fd-ab4a-439a-81b6-6da13406894f -->

AQUATIC  
Aquatic environments are among the most challenging for PCs short of other worlds and unusual planes. PCs in an aquatic environment need a way to breathe (typically a water breathing spell) and must usually Swim to move, though a PC who sinks to the bottom can walk awkwardly, using the rules for greater difficult terrain. Characters in aquatic environments make frequent use of the rules for aquatic combat (page 30, Player Core 437) and the drowning and suffocation rules (Player Core 437). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.782,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID f12c4b81-f508-40ee-a15f-2769ba8f6b54 -->

**Currents and Flowing Water**  
Ocean currents, flowing rivers, and similar moving water are difficult terrain or greater difficult terrain (depending on the speed of the water) for a creature Swimming against the current. At the end of a creature’s turn, it moves a certain distance depending on the current’s speed. For instance, a 10-foot current moves a creature 10 feet in the current’s direction at the end of that creature’s turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.073,r=0.474,b=0.221), with ID cb72603a-3df3-492b-9651-0ae37c0d2c26 -->

Underwater Visibility  
It’s much harder to see things at a distance underwater than it is on land, and it’s particularly difficult if the water is murky or full of particles. In pure water, the maximum visual range is roughly 240 feet to see a small object, and in murky water, visibility can be reduced to only 10 feet or even less. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.226,r=0.474,b=0.345), with ID c5855f88-7626-40e0-b163-0eb3380138bf -->

ARCTIC
The main challenge in an arctic environment is the extreme low temperature, but arctic environments also contain ice and snow. The disasters that most often strike in arctic environments are avalanches, blizzards, and floods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.350,r=0.474,b=0.452), with ID f3633767-4fb3-4fa4-8c35-7137b8249a9f -->

Ice  
Icy ground is both uneven ground and difficult terrain, as characters slip and slide due to poor traction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.458,r=0.474,b=0.515), with ID 1cbbe75f-2279-4eb5-8807-baeebdd15827 -->

Snow  
Depending on the depth of snow and its composition, most snowy ground is either difficult terrain or greater difficult terrain. In denser snow, characters can attempt to walk along the surface without breaking through, but some patches might be loose or soft enough that they’re uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.519,r=0.473,b=0.635), with ID 71fad446-10e9-4f0d-a5ea-c3379eaa65c2 -->

**DESERT**
Desert encompasses sandy and rocky deserts as well as badlands. Though tundra is technically a desert, it’s classified as arctic, as the climate is the primary challenge in such areas. Sandy deserts often have quicksand hazards (page 107) and sandstorms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.641,r=0.474,b=0.744), with ID f4e05c22-60b6-420b-801d-c11376208b14 -->

**Rubble**  
Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is difficult terrain. Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather than navigated through is uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.747,r=0.473,b=0.821), with ID 4c7e95e5-3186-4511-8a30-ed6908e21dd5 -->

Sand
Packed sand doesn’t usually significantly impede a character’s movement, but loose sand is either difficult terrain (if it’s shallow) or uneven ground (if it’s deep). The wind in a desert often shifts sand into dunes, hills of loose sand with uneven ground facing the wind and steeper inclines away from the wind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.826,r=0.474,b=0.944), with ID 9a6df0d1-c2a6-42e0-a3f0-59a8491a2318 -->

**FOREST**  
These diverse environments include jungles and other wooded areas. They are sometimes struck by wildfires. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.074,r=0.863,b=0.132), with ID 2d646d6c-c86e-4903-a793-44e87eac20b7 -->

Canopies  
Particularly dense forests, such as rain forests, have a canopy level above the ground. A creature trying to reach the canopy or travel along it must Climb. Swinging on vines and branches usually requires an Acrobatics or Athletics check. A canopy provides cover, and a thicker one can prevent creatures in the canopy from seeing those on the ground, and vice versa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.136,r=0.865,b=0.268), with ID 6f17b23a-3321-4afe-a3fc-1f8af4e0f1dd -->

Trees  
While trees are omnipresent in a forest, they typically don’t provide cover unless a character uses the Take Cover action. Only larger trees that take up an entire 5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to provide cover automatically. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.274,r=0.865,b=0.375), with ID f2d503ca-f440-4766-a38c-ca1b61456960 -->

Undergrowth  
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a character to Take Cover. Heavy undergrowth is greater difficult terrain that automatically provides cover. Some sorts of undergrowth, such as thorns, might also be hazardous terrain, and areas with plenty of twisting roots might be uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.380,r=0.865,b=0.498), with ID ebae7315-9569-42c6-95eb-2e92acad3d8a -->

MOUNTAIN
Mountain environments also include hills, which share many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme features. The most common disasters here are avalanches. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.504,r=0.866,b=0.577), with ID 9c0eef6f-3319-40f5-947b-667223815298 -->

Chasms
Chasms are natural pits, typically at least 20 feet long and clearly visible (barring mundane or magical efforts to conceal them). The main danger posed by a chasm is that characters must Long Jump to get across. Alternatively, characters can take the safer but slower route of Climbing down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the far side to get across. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.581,r=0.866,b=0.713), with ID e647cceb-5e15-45b6-aa0b-176ba05b9484 -->

Cliffs
Cliffs and rock walls require creatures to Climb to ascend or descend. Without extensive safety precautions, a critical failure on Climb checks can result in significant falling damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.718,r=0.864,b=0.804), with ID 18f03431-ab99-4ee4-94c4-355ee987da22 -->

**Rubble**  
Mountains often have extremely rocky areas or shifting, gravelly scree that makes for difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble is uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.809,r=0.863,b=0.882), with ID caf19211-c629-46bc-b0fe-988dd4c0d613 -->

**Slopes**  
Slopes vary from the gentle rises of normal terrain  
to difficult terrain and inclines, depending on the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.887,r=0.865,b=0.944), with ID dff9b7ca-13ed-40ba-a8f0-5b976fdb1b0e -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a segment of a large, serpentine creature with dark, spiked scales, and a medieval-style polearm weapon striking or embedded in its body. The image is cropped with a decorative gold border at the bottom right.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a section of a large, dragon-like creature's tail or body, covered in dark purple and green scales with prominent spikes.
  • A metallic polearm weapon with a spiked head is shown impacting or lodged in the creature.
  • The background is light, with swirling mist or clouds, suggesting an outdoor or aerial setting.
  • The image is vertically oriented and partially framed by a gold ornamental border at the lower right.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.
  • The illustration uses a muted, cool color palette with purples, greens, and silvery grays.
  • Lighting is diffuse, with no strong shadows, emphasizing the texture of the scales and weapon.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature's body curves from the upper left to the lower right, occupying most of the frame.
  • The polearm enters from the right, intersecting the creature's body at a perpendicular angle.
  • The gold border frames the lower right corner, suggesting this is part of a larger, ornate illustration or page.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a dynamic moment of conflict or attack, focusing on the impact between weapon and creature.
  • The detailed rendering of scales and weapon suggests a fantasy or mythological context, likely from a game or illustrated book.
  • The composition draws attention to the violence of the encounter and the formidable nature of the creature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.043,r=0.127,b=0.245), with ID d8c4e472-5883-4a5d-98f6-5436a0f99df3 -->

**Difficult terrain** is any terrain that impedes movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. Moving into a square of **greater difficult terrain** instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. Creatures can't normally Step into difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.158,r=0.504,b=0.310), with ID 947c4683-7cd0-4e29-b391-c26ec3137f96 -->

Any movement creatures make while jumping ignores
terrain that the creature is jumping over. Some abilities
(such as flight or being incorporeal) allow creatures
to avoid the movement reduction from some types of
difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let creatures ignore
difficult terrain while traveling on foot; such an ability
also allows a creature to move through greater difficult
terrain using the movement cost for difficult terrain, but
unless the ability specifies otherwise, these abilities don’t
let creatures ignore greater difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.150,t=0.311,r=0.503,b=0.463), with ID 893fefcb-f2e9-4808-baa3-acc590a60049 -->

**Hazardous terrain** damages creatures whenever they move through it. For instance, an acid pool, a pit of burning embers, and a spike-filled passageway all constitute hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.154,t=0.465,r=0.497,b=0.541), with ID 7857ca3d-1f7a-4fc2-b415-ae8a50d65ed1 -->

angle of elevation. Moving down a slope is typically
normal terrain, but characters might need to Climb up
particularly steep slopes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.570,r=0.513,b=0.619), with ID 2e1d0bb2-bdbd-403d-a174-95355e5812fe -->

Undergrowth  
Light undergrowth is common in mountains. It is difficult terrain and allows a character to Take Cover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.628,r=0.514,b=0.679), with ID 684ae90e-8bfb-473a-9ffc-03beb0fa25ad -->

PLAINs
The plains environment encompasses grasslands such as savannas and farmland. The most common disasters in plains are tornadoes and wildfires. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.691,r=0.513,b=0.756), with ID c57666ab-f8a9-4802-91b6-121525ae315f -->

## Hedges
Hedges are planted rows of bushes, shrubs, and trees. Their iconic appearance in adventures consists of tall hedges grown into mazes. A typical hedge is 2 to 5 feet tall, takes up a row of squares, and provides cover. A character trying to push through a hedge faces greater difficult terrain; it’s sometimes faster to Climb over. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.767,r=0.514,b=0.878), with ID ec948736-4b79-48b2-bf0a-118a70219814 -->

Undergrowth  
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a character to Take Cover. Heavy undergrowth is greater <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.890,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 2195a21d-6921-4b7c-a2ed-778f00a16b66 -->

difficult terrain that provides cover automatically.
Undergrowth in plains is usually light with a few
scattered areas of heavy undergrowth, but fields of
certain crops, like corn, are entirely heavy undergrowth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.079,r=0.904,b=0.144), with ID c4cc79cf-a3e9-48a2-9fe7-6e8b7d3d5765 -->

Swamp  
Wetlands are the most common kind of swamp, but this category also includes drier marshes such as moors. Swamps often contain quicksand hazards (page 107). Despite their soggy nature, swamps aren’t very likely to experience heavy flooding, since they act as natural sponges and absorb a great deal of water before they flood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.153,r=0.904,b=0.265), with ID 2fefe948-4814-44b2-b00f-3954bf63cdae -->

Bogs
Also called mires, bogs are watery areas that accumulate peat, are covered by shrubs and moss, and sometimes feature floating islands of vegetation covering deeper pools. Shallow bogs are difficult terrain for a Medium creature, and deep bogs are greater difficult terrain. If a bog is deep enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the creature has to Swim. Bogs are also acidic, so particularly extreme or magical bogs can be hazardous terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.277,r=0.903,b=0.418), with ID 63a29a6f-d485-4bed-b6d8-e7f81b721a7b -->

Undergrowth  
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a character to Take Cover, while heavy undergrowth is greater difficult terrain that provides cover automatically. Some sorts of undergrowth, such as thorns, are also hazardous terrain, and areas with plenty of twisting roots are uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.430,r=0.904,b=0.540), with ID aa70204c-e943-4ce3-8c60-98e93ceef87a -->

Urban

Urban environments include open city spaces as well as buildings. The building information in this section also applies to ruins and constructed dungeons. Depending on their construction and location, cities might be vulnerable to many sorts of disasters, especially fires and floods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.552,r=0.903,b=0.647), with ID 4c686f86-c5db-4c9e-a0dd-ed4d896dc0d6 -->

Crowds
Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain if an area is truly packed with people. You might allow a character to get a crowd to part using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance.

A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the danger as quickly as possible, but it is slowed by its own mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at the Speed of an average member each round (usually 25 feet), potentially trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of the crowd. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.660,r=0.903,b=0.846), with ID e0b8dc71-7e46-410a-bdf0-5cb8d8e8cd0e -->

Doors  
Opening an unlocked door requires an Interact action (or more than one for a particularly complicated or large door). Stuck doors must be Forced Open, and locked ones require a character to Pick the Lock or Force them Open. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.860,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 88318b8a-56c2-4169-accc-6769236dd808 -->

BUILDING GAMES <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.688,t=0.017,r=0.870,b=0.044), with ID 43d9e98e-5b6e-477e-8a17-844cbf0fced9 -->

2 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.914,t=0.015,r=0.966,b=0.052), with ID de431335-ea75-4a52-afd0-932c758b573d -->

**Floors**  
Wooden floors are easy to walk on, as are flagstone floors made of fitted stones. However, floors of worn flagstone often contain areas of uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.145), with ID 90f27490-bfd3-48dd-9ade-6bcd1b1d3385 -->

## Gates
Walled settlements often have gates that the city can close for defense or open to allow travel. A typical gate consists of one portcullis at each end of a gatehouse, with murder holes in between or other protected spots from which guards can attack foes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.152,r=0.473,b=0.252), with ID 3ddd57fd-09b3-4ba1-a974-e6c0c863ac68 -->

Guards  
Most settlements of significant size have guards working in shifts to protect the settlement at all hours, patrolling the streets and guarding various posts. The size of this force varies from one guard for every 1,000 residents to a force 10 times this number. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.259,r=0.473,b=0.359), with ID 2213db6e-37d5-4374-9d56-640967b28258 -->

Portcullises  
A portcullis is a wooden or iron grate that descends to seal off a gate or corridor. Most are raised on ropes or chains operated by a winch, and they have locking mechanisms that keep them from being lifted easily. The rules on lifting a portcullis or bending its bars appear in the sidebar on this page. If a portcullis falls on a creature, use a slamming door trap (page 104). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.366,r=0.473,b=0.498), with ID 0daf347e-3891-4597-8971-9ef03847e338 -->

**Rooftops**  
Rooftops make for memorable ambushes, chase scenes, infiltrations, and running fights. Flat roofs are easy to move across, but they’re rare in any settlement that receives significant snowfall, since heavy buildups of snow can collapse a roof. Angled roofs are uneven ground, or inclines if they’re especially steep. The peak of an angled roof is a narrow surface. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.504,r=0.472,b=0.632), with ID ae3738d3-a6e0-4fd3-8173-c8dc2a9952b7 -->

Hurdling from roof to roof often requires a Long Jump, though some buildings are close enough to Leap between. A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof, or a Leap followed by Grabbing an Edge and Climbing up. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.633,r=0.473,b=0.697), with ID adbe9072-1154-4b30-a3b7-237beb45facd -->

Sewers
Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend and descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer workers access, while channels in the center carry the waste itself. Less sophisticated sewers, or sections those workers don’t usually access, might require wading through disease-ridden waste. Sewers can be accessed through sewer grates, which usually require 2 or more Interact actions to open. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.704,r=0.472,b=0.850), with ID 52de2fe8-a45e-4bf1-b83a-a0284af8dbdf -->

Sewer Gas  
Sewer gas often contains pockets of highly flammable gas. A pocket of sewer gas exposed to a source of flame explodes, dealing moderate environmental fire damage to creatures in the area. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.858,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 1c67f1d2-81d1-4799-9b51-a6b2e3d1cab6 -->

## DOORS, GATES, AND WALLS
Some of the most common obstacles that characters face in urban areas and dungeons are doors, gates, and walls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.090,r=0.849,b=0.147), with ID ba1a40d6-535a-4734-accc-ae88bd4a096c -->

Climbing
The table below gives the typical DC for Athletics checks to Climb a structure, which is usually a simple DC. You might adjust the difficulty based on the specifics of the structure and environment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.154,r=0.849,b=0.237), with ID 08f87d25-91f7-432c-a626-4ee5cabf564b -->

## Demolishing
A character might want to smash their way through a door, a window, or certain walls. The Hardness, Hit Point, and Broken Threshold values provided in the table below are based on the material the structure is typically made out of, so a portcullis made of iron, for example, has a higher Hardness than one of wood. For more on damaging objects, see _Player Core_ 269. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.245,r=0.848,b=0.372), with ID 13c6f98d-c44e-41f7-92a9-c262ac26f5fe -->

Strong walls, such as well-maintained masonry or hewn stone, can't be broken without dedicated work and proper tools. Getting through such walls requires downtime. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.371,r=0.848,b=0.434), with ID c253f664-858a-4e98-92de-70e898491180 -->

FORCING OPEN  
Structures that can be opened—such as doors, gates, and windows—can be Forced Open using Athletics. This is usually necessary only if they're locked or stuck. The DC to Force Open a structure uses the Thievery DC of its lock but adjusts it to be very hard (increasing the DC by 5). If there's no lock, use the following table; when lifting a portcullis, use the lock DC or the DC from the table, whichever is higher. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.673,r=0.848,b=0.818), with ID f8b5bb4d-d6c6-4933-acdd-23acdffc6296 -->

DUNGEONS
Dungeon environments, which include both ruins and contemporary buildings constructed in the wilderness, are a fairly common venue for adventures. As an environment, they combine urban features like doors and buildings (page 92) with features from an underground environment, and occasionally components from other environments. While underground dungeons are particularly common, you might also consider setting your adventure in a ruin reclaimed by the forest, with giant trees spreading their roots through the walls, or a ruin deep in a swamp, with bogs covering access to some of the ruin’s hidden secrets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.076,r=0.511,b=0.308), with ID f1e2609c-9b56-4770-a0a8-4feef71983dc -->

Stairs
Stairs are difficult terrain for characters moving up them, and shoddy stairs might also be uneven ground. Some temples and giant-built structures have enormous stairs that are greater difficult terrain both up and down, or might require Climbing every step. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.321,r=0.515,b=0.421), with ID d9c1bc4b-d963-429d-bec2-a3651cbfaf52 -->

**Streets**  
Most settlements have narrow and twisting streets that were largely established organically as the settlement grew in size. These roads are rarely more than 20 feet wide, with alleys as narrow as 5 feet. Streets are generally paved with cobblestones. If the cobblestones are in poor repair, they could be difficult terrain or uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.429,r=0.515,b=0.557), with ID 405f1cc5-355a-400a-8a65-3a28cc19c17d -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a massive stone gate with dragon-head sculptures, from which streams of molten lava pour into a cavern filled with lava pools and stepping stones.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a large, ornate stone gate with vertical iron bars, set into a rocky cavern wall.
  • Two dragon-head sculptures are mounted on either side of the gate, each spewing streams of bright orange molten lava.
  • The foreground is dominated by a pool of glowing lava with several dark, flat stones or platforms scattered across its surface.
  • The perspective is slightly low and frontal, emphasizing the imposing size of the gate and the hazardous terrain.
  • The color palette is dominated by fiery oranges, reds, and yellows for the lava, contrasted with dark grays and browns for the stonework.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • No visible text or UI elements within the image itself.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the lava providing an intense internal glow that illuminates the scene from below.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The stone gate and dragon heads are in the background, forming the focal point.
  • The streams of lava flow from the dragon mouths down to the lava pool in the foreground.
  • The stepping stones are scattered irregularly across the lava, suggesting a possible (but dangerous) path toward the gate.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of danger and foreboding, with the lava acting as both a barrier and a source of light.
  • The imposing gate and dragon motifs suggest a fantasy or dungeon setting, likely intended to challenge or intimidate viewers or adventurers.
  • The stepping stones imply a potential route, but the hazardous environment dominates the scene, emphasizing peril and adventure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.567,r=0.640,b=0.958), with ID 23455820-be24-4c5b-a091-1125439685e6 -->

Particularly lawful or well-planned cities have major thoroughfares that allow wagons and merchants to reach marketplaces and other important areas in town. These need to be at least 25 feet wide to accommodate wagons moving in both directions, and they often have narrow sidewalks that allow pedestrians to avoid wagon traffic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.079,r=0.904,b=0.174), with ID 0da463dd-114a-476b-bf67-cda5809bed3e -->

## Walls
Well-built structures have exterior walls of brick or stonemasonry. Smaller, lower-quality, or temporary structures might have wooden walls. Interior walls tend to be less sturdy; they could be made of wooden planks, or even simply of thick, opaque paper held in a wooden frame. An underground structure might have thick walls carved out of solid rock to prevent the weight of the ground above from collapsing the structure. Rules for climbing and breaking walls are in the sidebar on page 93. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.184,r=0.904,b=0.342), with ID 28b489fe-d2fd-49e7-a416-778356fa1bd1 -->

UNDERGROUND  
Underground environments consist of caves and natural underground areas. Artificial dungeons and ruins combine underground features with urban features like stairs and walls. Deep underground vaults have some of the same terrain features as mountains, such as chasms and cliffs. The most common disasters underground are collapses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.353,r=0.903,b=0.465), with ID 5ffc6303-d1cf-42e8-b833-39f9c8b4957d -->

**Floors**  
Natural underground environments rarely have flat floors, instead featuring abrupt changes in elevation that result in difficult terrain, uneven ground, and inclines. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.475,r=0.903,b=0.542), with ID 34ef8021-ec67-4a3d-a779-d574ab9b586b -->

Ledges
Ledges are narrow surfaces that overlook a lower area or provide the only means to move along the edge of a chasm. Moving across a narrow ledge requires using Acrobatics to Balance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.553,r=0.903,b=0.632), with ID edef11ee-b5d7-49b4-8800-74dc2c0b3469 -->

Rubble
Caverns can be covered in rubble, which is difficult terrain. Deep or pervasive rubble is also uneven ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.643,r=0.901,b=0.695), with ID 566ed33e-7334-4825-a7b0-e3420879951b -->

Stalagmites and Stalactites  
Stalagmites are tapering columns that rise from the floor of a cave. Areas filled with stalagmites are greater difficult terrain, and especially large stalagmites have to be sidestepped or Climbed. Stalagmites can be sharp enough they can be used as hazardous terrain in some circumstances, as can stalactites (icicle-shaped formations that hang from the roof of a cave) if they’re knocked loose from a ceiling or overhang. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.706,r=0.903,b=0.879), with ID e38cac6f-a084-4720-bffb-7967d22dce13 -->

**Walls**  
Natural cave walls are rough and uneven, with nooks, crannies, and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.663,t=0.889,r=0.903,b=0.940), with ID 8b578dd0-31dd-4b21-8dc2-42a3ad496245 -->

ledges. Since most caves are formed by water, cave
walls are often damp, making them even more difficult
to Climb. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.128), with ID 0b3db22c-1f75-4830-92f3-96d12a9da4f2 -->

Climate
Weather is more than just set dressing to establish mood—it has mechanical effects you can combine with environmental components to create a more memorable encounter. Weather can impose circumstance penalties on certain checks, from –1 to –4 based on severity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.137,r=0.471,b=0.236), with ID 67357f41-11ec-4137-aad6-d66ed5678adf -->

Fog  
Fog imposes a circumstance penalty to visual Perception checks, depending on the thickness; it causes creatures viewed through significant amounts of fog to be concealed; and it cuts off all visibility at half a mile or less—possibly much less. Conditions limiting visibility to about a mile are called mist, and those that do so to about 3 miles are called haze. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.245,r=0.471,b=0.374), with ID 56d83698-d44e-4af8-bf39-94a996f5c849 -->

Precipitation

Precipitation includes rain as well as colder snow, sleet, and hail. Wet precipitation douses flames, and frozen precipitation can create areas of snow or ice on the ground. Drizzle or light snowfall has little mechanical effect beyond limited visibility. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.383,r=0.471,b=0.481), with ID eb82125a-b459-4e72-86d6-a8bf08f2c839 -->

Most forms of precipitation impose circumstance penalties on visual Perception checks. Hail often is sparser but loud, instead penalizing auditory Perception checks. Especially heavy precipitation, such as a downpour of rain or heavy snow, might make creatures concealed if they’re far away. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.491,r=0.471,b=0.603), with ID 6345540d-6e68-4d2c-aa70-16ea6e193f34 -->

Fatigue  
Precipitation causes discomfort and fatigue. Anything heavier than drizzle or light snowfall reduces the time it takes for characters to become fatigued from overland travel to only 4 hours. Heavy precipitation can be dangerous in cold environments when characters go without protection. Soaked characters treat the temperature as one step colder (mild to severe, severe to extreme; see Temperature below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.614,r=0.471,b=0.756), with ID fc0b211d-6a7c-4bfa-beb3-9664b22b6fbc -->

Thunderstorms  
High winds and heavy precipitation accompany many thunderstorms. There’s also a very small chance that a character might be struck by lightning during a storm. A lightning strike usually deals moderate electricity damage, or major electricity damage in a severe thunderstorm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.767,r=0.470,b=0.878), with ID f76b11a6-3ec2-4d0a-b161-a89ed063e369 -->

**Wind**  
Wind imposes a circumstance penalty on auditory Perception checks depending on its strength. It also interferes with physical ranged attacks such as arrows, imposing a circumstance penalty to attack rolls involving such weapons, and potentially making attacks with them impossible in powerful windstorms. Wind snuffs out handheld flames; lanterns protect their flame from the wind, but particularly powerful winds can extinguish these as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.521,r=0.860,b=0.678), with ID dc1764b2-b8ab-4203-a413-1cd025aeb45c -->

Moving in Wind  
Wind is difficult or greater difficult terrain when Flying. Moving in wind of sufficient strength requires a Maneuver in Flight action, and fliers are blown away on a critical failure or if they don’t succeed at a minimum of one such check each round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.690,r=0.860,b=0.785), with ID dab79450-01d1-4028-b2cc-7147bf8c3707 -->

Even on the ground, particularly strong winds might require a creature to succeed at an Athletics check to move, knocking the creature back and prone on a critical failure. On such checks, Small creatures typically take a –1 circumstance penalty, and Tiny creatures typically take a –2 penalty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.786,r=0.860,b=0.878), with ID 6a037f29-c7f0-4859-9516-06f64feefe61 -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative UI element with a number, likely representing a score, level, or value in a game or application.

screenshot:
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is a stylized green and gold border with a central diamond motif and two symmetrical curved shapes.
  • Below the motif, a tan rectangular box contains the number "95" in bold, dark red font.
  • The background is dark brown, and the design is ornate, suggesting a fantasy or historical theme.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The number "95" is clearly visible and centered in the box.
  • No other UI elements or text are visible in the crop.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The decorative motif is at the top, with the number box directly beneath it.
  • The number "95" is the focal point, framed by the ornate design above.

Analysis : 
  • The image likely represents a status indicator, such as a score, level, or resource count, within a themed interface. The ornate design draws attention to the number, emphasizing its importance. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.899,t=0.926,r=1.000,b=0.982), with ID 83dd26ba-aa22-4655-8c3e-b637543ef9ff -->

acute danger, especially to those directly exposed to
their fury. The damage in the following sections uses
the categories in the Environmental Damage table on
page 90. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.078,r=0.515,b=0.145), with ID fa62f3f9-135a-49f4-9617-f86fbd05d887 -->

Avalanches
Though the term avalanche specifically refers to a cascading flow of ice and snow down a mountain’s slope, the same rules work for landslides, mudslides, and other similar disasters. Avalanches of wet snow usually travel up to 200 feet per round, though powdery snow can travel up to 10 times faster. Rockslides and mudslides are slower, sometimes even slow enough that a character might be able to outrun them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.153,r=0.515,b=0.295), with ID 8760bf62-d963-4442-812f-ea5e6cea05b1 -->

An avalanche deals major or even massive bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path. These victims are also buried under a significant mass. Creatures caught in an avalanche’s path can attempt a Reflex save; if they succeed, they take only half the bludgeoning damage, and if they critically succeed, they also avoid being buried. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.295,r=0.515,b=0.404), with ID 69d994c3-f999-4de5-8362-1229b1c21b1e -->

Burial  
Buried creatures take minor bludgeoning damage each minute, and they potentially take minor cold damage if buried under an avalanche of snow. At the GM’s discretion, creatures without a sufficient air pocket could also risk suffocation (*Player Core* 437). A buried creature is restrained and usually can’t free itself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.415,r=0.514,b=0.525), with ID 79fd2337-65af-4848-9515-d1545ff603a6 -->

Allies or bystanders can attempt to dig out a buried
creature. Each creature digging clears roughly a 5-foot-
by-5-foot square every 4 minutes with a successful
Athletics check (or every 2 minutes on a critical success).
Using shovels or other proper tools halves the time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.525,r=0.514,b=0.603), with ID 1c386fdd-d360-465e-ab88-0ccc6ae17ef2 -->

Blizzards

Blizzards combine cold weather, heavy snow, and strong winds. They don’t pose a single direct threat as other disasters do; instead, the combination of these factors all at once poses a substantial impediment to characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.612,r=0.514,b=0.710), with ID d71d93dd-1659-42e2-ba92-9bdb7c9f03f6 -->

Collapses

Collapses and cave-ins occur when caverns or buildings fall, dumping tons of rock or other material on those caught below or inside them. Creatures under the collapse take major or massive bludgeoning damage and become buried, just as with an avalanche. Fortunately, collapses don’t spread unless they weaken the overall integrity of the area and lead to further collapses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.720,r=0.514,b=0.848), with ID 950f3f72-210f-4935-a905-48608e945637 -->

Earthquakes

Earthquakes often cause other natural disasters in the form of avalanches, collapses, floods, and tsunamis, but they also present unique threats such as fissures, soil liquefaction, and tremors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.858,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID c2cc222e-a4e1-4b21-a9a2-0f3acb1880f5 -->

Fissures

Fissures and other ground ruptures can destabilize structures, but more directly they lead to creatures taking bludgeoning damage from falling into a fissure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.145), with ID fb356774-1127-4e28-9f9f-825200ae8c73 -->

Soil Liquefaction  
Liquefaction occurs when granular particles shake to the point where they temporarily lose their solid form and act as liquids. When this happens to soil, it can cause creatures and even whole buildings to sink into the ground. You can use the *earthquake* spell for more specific rules, though that spell represents only one particular kind of localized quake. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.154,r=0.905,b=0.281), with ID 8166afa1-4874-4a06-af4c-1d12a6de28ba -->

Tremors
Tremors knock creatures prone, causing them to fall or careen into other objects, which can deal bludgeoning damage appropriate to the severity of the quake. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.292,r=0.904,b=0.358), with ID 762c2974-6c6d-4fbd-87ec-458db10383c2 -->

Floods  
Though more gradual floods can damage structures and drown creatures, flash floods are similar to avalanches, except with a liquid mass instead of a solid one. Instead of burying creatures, a flash flood carries creatures and even massive objects away, buffeting the creatures and potentially drowning them. The drowning rules appear on page 437 of Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.368,r=0.904,b=0.495), with ID 1847e7a2-98e9-447e-a174-a66aff484611 -->

Sandstorms  
Mild sandstorms and dust storms don’t present much more danger than a windy rainstorm, but they can cause damage to a creature’s lungs and spread diseases across long distances. Heavy sandstorms deal minor slashing damage each round to those exposed to the sand, force creatures to hold their breath to avoid suffocation, or both. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.506,r=0.904,b=0.618), with ID 17f0049f-bb81-4a61-9668-3143d69f9db2 -->

## Tornadoes
In a tornado’s path, wind conditions impose severe circumstance penalties, but creatures that would normally be blown away are instead picked up in the tornado’s funnel, where they take massive bludgeoning damage from flying debris as they rise through the cone until they are eventually expelled (taking bludgeoning damage from falling).
Tornadoes usually travel around 300 feet per round (roughly 30 miles per hour). They normally travel a few miles before dissipating. Some tornadoes are stationary or travel much faster. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.629,r=0.904,b=0.816), with ID 5d1f0269-213a-47ce-a39b-060ca4a641f4 -->

Tsunamis

Tsunamis present many of the same dangers as flash floods but are much larger and more destructive. Tsunami waves can reach 100 feet or more in height, wrecking buildings and creatures alike with massive bludgeoning damage from both the wave itself and debris pulled up along its path of destruction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.829,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID f56ab2b3-e618-4ad4-96cd-507643539804 -->

**Volcanic Eruptions**  
Volcanic eruptions can contain any combination of ash, lava bombs, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and vents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.075,r=0.471,b=0.129), with ID 949b57c4-9be0-4826-9065-fbf17ee63e46 -->

Ash  
Ash from volcanic eruptions is hot enough to cause minor fire damage each minute. It limits visibility like a thick fog and can make air unbreathable, requiring characters to hold their breath or suffocate (*Player Core* 437). Ash clouds generate ash lightning strikes, which typically deal moderate electricity damage but are very unlikely to hit an individual creature. Ash buildup on the ground creates areas of uneven ground, difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain, and ash in the atmosphere can block the sun for weeks or even months, leading to colder temperatures and longer winters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.139,r=0.472,b=0.328), with ID 6c0f8698-3ef4-46a8-bbbd-b62c4cf8a849 -->

Lava Bombs
Pressure can launch lava into the air that falls as lava bombs: masses of lava that solidify as they fly and shatter on impact, dealing at least moderate bludgeoning damage and moderate fire damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.338,r=0.471,b=0.419), with ID b71896cf-4f31-4826-a712-2b0430b572d8 -->

Lava Flows  
Lava flows are an iconic volcanic threat; they usually move between 5 and 60 feet per round over normal ground, so characters can often outrun them. However, flows can move up to 300 feet per round in a steep volcanic tube or channel. Lava emanates heat that deals minor fire damage even before it comes into contact with creatures, and immersion in lava deals massive fire damage each round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.431,r=0.470,b=0.557), with ID 0f29054d-ddfa-4ea8-8dcd-91de18ad3c8a -->

Pyroclastic Flows  
Mixes of hot gases and rock debris, pyroclastic flows spread much faster than lava, sometimes more than 4,000 feet per round. While cooler than the hottest lava, pyroclastic flows are capable of overwhelming entire settlements. They work like avalanches but deal half of their damage as fire damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.568,r=0.471,b=0.679), with ID 7c1b87af-d9ef-445d-b62b-105347f3c912 -->

Vents  
Steam vents shoot from the ground, dealing moderate fire damage or more in a wide column. Acidic and poisonous gases released from beneath the surface can create wide areas of hazardous terrain that deals at least minor acid or poison damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.691,r=0.470,b=0.786), with ID f55c55cd-ed5c-4e02-8fce-03c240285070 -->

Wildfires
Wildfires travel mainly along a front moving in a single direction. In a forest, the front can advance up to 70 feet per round (7 miles per hour). They can move up to twice as fast across plains due to a lack of shade and the relatively low humidity. Embers from the fire, carried by winds and rising hot air, can scatter, forming spot fires as far as 10 miles away from the main wildfire. Wildfires present three main threats: flames, heat, and smoke. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.797,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID 56ac1d2f-ee33-4137-957a-c2bcaad8b310 -->

Flames

Flames are hazardous terrain, usually dealing moderate damage and potentially setting a character on fire, dealing moderate persistent fire damage. The flames from a small fire are often less dangerous than the advancing heat from the front of a large fire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.078,r=0.862,b=0.174), with ID fcb79694-6eb7-4e37-b5fa-5042529eb318 -->

Heat  
Wildfires increase the temperature in advance of the front, reaching nearly 1,500°F at the fire’s arrival, as hot as some lava. This begins as minor fire damage every round at a reasonable distance from the front and increases to massive fire damage for someone within the wildfire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.186,r=0.861,b=0.296), with ID e3b38c8b-4d61-434b-b777-2138262801bf -->

Smoke  
Wind can carry smoke far in front of the wildfire itself. Smoke imposes a circumstance penalty to visual Perception checks, depending on the thickness. It causes creatures viewed through significant amounts of smoke to be concealed, and it cuts off all visibility at half a mile or less. Near or within the wildfire, the combination of smoke and heated air require characters to hold their breath or suffocate (*Player Core* 437). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.308,r=0.861,b=0.449), with ID b4674f4b-3302-4121-b59e-33ddae37f038 -->

Summary : This is a dramatic illustration of a powerful thunderstorm, featuring a large, swirling mass of dark clouds illuminated by a vivid lightning bolt striking the ground, with debris or broken structures visible at the storm's base.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a massive, dark storm cloud shaped like a vortex or tornado, dominating the center of the image.
  • A bright, jagged lightning bolt descends from the upper right, striking the ground near the bottom center.
  • The setting appears to be an open field with green grass in the foreground and scattered debris or broken wooden structures at the base of the storm.
  • The color palette is dominated by deep blues, blacks, and purples, with bright white and electric blue highlights from the lightning.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the lightning providing the primary illumination, casting stark contrasts and highlighting the turbulent texture of the clouds.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  • The image is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and stylized cloud forms.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The storm cloud occupies the majority of the image, with the lightning bolt creating a strong vertical line from top right to bottom center.
  • The debris is clustered at the lower right, suggesting destruction caused by the storm.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the lightning and storm vortex slightly off-center, creating dynamic tension.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys the immense power and danger of severe thunderstorms, emphasizing the destructive force of lightning and turbulent winds.
  • The swirling cloud structure and debris suggest a tornado or supercell storm, with the lightning bolt highlighting the storm's intensity.
  • The use of color and lighting draws the viewer's eye to the lightning and the heart of the storm, reinforcing the sense of drama and chaos. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.482,r=0.885,b=0.935), with ID a2c0c63a-cfdc-4aeb-8f29-ca4ff4e60a7f -->

# HAZARDS

*Dungeons are rife with devious traps meant to protect the treasures within. These range from mechanical devices that shoot darts or drop heavy blocks to magic runes that explode into bursts of flame. In addition to traps, adventurers may stumble into other types of hazards, including naturally occurring environmental hazards, mysterious hauntings, and more.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.076,r=0.909,b=0.184), with ID 3aee707f-a601-4189-ad42-78407500f969 -->

# DETECTING A HAZARD
Every hazard has a trigger of some kind that sets its dangers in motion. For traps, this could be a mechanism like a trip wire or a pressure plate, while for an environmental hazard or haunt, the trigger may simply be proximity. When characters approach a hazard, they have a chance of finding the trigger area or mechanism before triggering the hazard. They automatically receive a check to detect hazards unless the hazards require a minimum proficiency rank to do so. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.213,r=0.515,b=0.371), with ID 3e116092-bef7-40b1-97de-feccb98b5ed4 -->

During exploration, determine whether the party
detects a hazard when the PCs first enter the general
area in which it appears. If the hazard doesn’t list a
minimum proficiency rank, roll a secret Perception
check against the hazard’s Stealth DC for each PC. For
hazards with a minimum proficiency rank, roll only if
someone is actively searching (using the Search activity
while exploring or the Seek action in an encounter),
and only if they have the listed proficiency rank or higher.
Anyone who succeeds becomes aware of the hazard, and
you can describe what they notice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.373,r=0.515,b=0.540), with ID 0b0ece65-15fe-452c-a386-2f4050ae5b9a -->

Magical hazards that don’t have a minimum
proficiency rank can be found using detect magic,
but this spell doesn’t provide enough information to
understand or disable the hazard—it only reveals
the hazard’s presence. Determining a magical
hazard’s properties thoroughly enough to disable it
requires either the use of more powerful magic or a
successful skill check, likely using Identify Magic or
Recall Knowledge. Magical hazards with a minimum
proficiency rank cannot be found with detect magic
at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.541,r=0.515,b=0.709), with ID 5964bdc7-f91c-45b8-a3a8-d698f7a43dbf -->

TRIGGERING A HAZARD  
If the group fails to detect a hazard and the hazard’s trigger is a standard part of traveling (such as stepping on a floor plate or moving through a magical sensor while walking), the hazard’s reaction occurs. Hazards that would be triggered only when someone directly manipulates the environment—by opening a door, for example—use their reactions only if a PC explicitly takes that action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.720,r=0.514,b=0.863), with ID bbdcf147-be98-4d9c-834a-060a1c1e48ba -->

Reaction or Free Action  
Most hazards have reactions that occur when they’re triggered. For simple hazards, the reaction is the entirety of the hazard’s effect. For complex hazards, the reaction <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.873,r=0.515,b=0.941), with ID f5eb80fd-23aa-47fe-86d9-3f2238f93e14 -->

may also cause the hazard to roll initiative, either
starting a combat encounter or joining one already in
progress, and the hazard continues to pose a threat over
multiple rounds. Some hazards have a triggered free
action instead of a reaction; for instance, quicksand can
suck down multiple creatures per round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.219,r=0.905,b=0.312), with ID b9e88e8e-1913-49c6-8d3d-12d837f48b9d -->

Routine  
A complex hazard usually follows a set of preprogrammed actions called a routine. Once triggered, the hazard first performs its initial reaction; then, if the PCs are not yet in encounter mode, they should roll initiative. If they are already in encounter mode, their initiative remains the same. The hazard might tell you to roll initiative for it—in this case, the hazard rolls initiative using its Stealth modifier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.322,r=0.905,b=0.463), with ID ba76b2d1-59ae-4c12-aae1-b52143d36692 -->

After this happens, the hazard follows its routine each
round on its initiative. The number of actions a hazard
can take each round, as well as what they can be used
for, depend on the hazard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.465,r=0.903,b=0.525), with ID 79482c95-99c7-485d-944e-a8bdaf072959 -->

Resetting a Hazard  
Some hazards can be reset, allowing them to be triggered again. This can occur automatically, as for quicksand, whose surface settles after 24 hours, or manually, like a hidden pit, whose trapdoor must be closed for the pit to become hidden again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.536,r=0.903,b=0.632), with ID 84c5d768-94fd-42d1-ac3f-15b49054003f -->

# Disabling a Hazard
The most versatile method for deactivating traps is the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill, though most mechanical traps can also simply be smashed, and magical traps can usually be counteracted. Environmental hazards often can be overcome with Nature or Survival, and haunts can often be overcome with Occultism or Religion. The specific skill and DC required to disable a hazard are listed in the hazard’s stat block. Like using Disable a Device, using these skills to disable a trap is a 2-action activity with the same degrees of success, though the activity might have different traits determined by the GM. As with detecting a hazard, disabling a hazard might require a character to have a certain proficiency rank in the listed skill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.644,r=0.904,b=0.891), with ID 0b1f2125-fcef-4135-8c1c-7146832bcf17 -->

A character must first detect a hazard (or have it
pointed out to them) to try to deactivate it. They can
attempt to deactivate a hazard whether or not it has <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.893,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID d8143a78-1d11-435e-8ecb-22eab4f1baef -->

already been triggered, though some hazards no longer
pose a danger once their reactions have occurred,
especially if there is no way for them to be reset. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.080,r=0.471,b=0.126), with ID 1c97ca91-6f18-41eb-a77b-09e147135b7c -->

For most hazards, a successful check for the listed
skill against the DC in the stat block disables the hazard
without triggering it. Any other means of deactivating
the hazard are included in the hazard’s stat block, as are
any additional steps required to properly deactivate it.
A critical failure on any roll to disable a hazard triggers
it, including a critical failure on a roll to counteract a
magical hazard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.126,r=0.471,b=0.249), with ID 39a15f6f-0c59-4e11-8a8c-31c5daccc5fc -->

Some hazards require multiple successful checks to
deactivate, typically because they have a particularly
complicated component or have several discrete
portions. For hazards with a complex component, a
critical success on a check to disable the hazard counts
as two successes on a single component. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.250,r=0.471,b=0.342), with ID 096a3329-e071-4c02-baa5-06370cc3a3ce -->

Damaging a Hazard  
Rather than trying to carefully disable a hazard, a character might just smash it. Damaging a mechanical trap or another physical hazard works like damaging objects: the hazard reduces the damage it takes by its Hardness. In most cases, hitting the hazard also triggers it, as explained in Attacking a Hazard below. If a hazard’s Hit Points are reduced to its Broken Threshold (BT) or lower, the hazard becomes broken and can’t be activated, though it can still be repaired. If it’s reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed and can’t be repaired. (See Player Core 269 for more information on damaging objects.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.352,r=0.471,b=0.555), with ID a738cb35-dfcc-4a29-aad3-ca03efef2502 -->

Hazards’ AC, applicable saving throw modifiers, Hardness, HP, and BT are listed in their stat blocks. A hazard that doesn’t list one of these statistics can’t be affected by anything targeting that statistic. For example, a hazard that has HP but no BT can’t be broken, but it can still be destroyed. Hazards are immune to anything an object is immune to unless specifically noted otherwise, and they can’t be targeted by anything that can’t target objects. Some hazards may have additional immunities, as well as resistances or weaknesses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.556,r=0.470,b=0.724), with ID a1e29c8e-7c17-49a0-9fd4-168dacb2926a -->

Attacking a Hazard  
If someone hits a hazard—especially if it’s a mechanical trap—they usually trigger it, though you might determine otherwise in some cases. An attack that breaks the hazard might prevent it from triggering, depending on the circumstances. If the hazard has multiple parts, breaking one part might still trigger the trap. For example, if a trap has a trip wire in one location and launches an attack from another location, severing the trip wire could still trigger the attack. Destroying a trap in one blow almost never triggers it. These rules also apply to most damaging spells or other effects in addition to attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.737,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID da1fb567-ce05-4af3-88c6-2b6bbb5e0108 -->

## MONSTERS AND HAZARDS
The statistics for NPCs and monsters usually don't list their proficiency ranks. Most of the time, they don't need to deal with detecting or disabling hazards the way PCs do, so you don't need this information. However, if a PC resets a trap in a monster's path or plans to lure a monster into a hazard, you can improvise this information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.090,r=0.849,b=0.202), with ID 81f17784-c683-426b-8fa3-dcfc95a28b83 -->

For Perception, a monster is usually an expert at 3rd or 4th level, a master at 8th or 9th level, and legendary at 16th or 17th level. If the monster has Thievery listed in its skills, it has the highest proficiency possible for its level (trained at 1st, expert at 3rd, master at 7th, and legendary at 15th); otherwise, it's untrained. Of course, an individual monster might deviate from these guidelines, especially if it's mindless or not very perceptive. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.204,r=0.849,b=0.325), with ID e6726825-4e23-46d8-b721-63ded5c668b9 -->

Repairing a Hazard  
You might allow a character to repair a damaged hazard to restore its functionality. You determine the specifics of this, since it can vary by trap. The Repair action might be insufficient if fixing the trap requires gathering scattered components or the like. If the item has a Reset entry, the character needs to do whatever is listed there, in addition to repairing the damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.354,r=0.861,b=0.480), with ID 116f4609-73ac-46b9-88c9-5ce1c59361df -->

Counteracting a Magical Hazard  
Some magical hazards can be counteracted using *dispel magic* and the counteracting rules (*Player Core* 303). These hazards’ spell ranks and counteract DCs are listed in their stat block. Counteracting a hazard otherwise works like using a skill check to disable the hazard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.491,r=0.860,b=0.586), with ID 0ff78b62-29f2-44bb-a58a-1fe1fed493fd -->

# HAZARD EXPERIENCE
Characters gain Experience Points for overcoming a hazard, whether they disable it, avoid it, or simply endure its attacks. If they trigger the same hazard later on, they don’t gain XP for the hazard again. The XP values for hazards of different levels also appear on page 57 but are repeated here for convenience. The XP for a complex hazard is equal to the XP for a monster of the same level, and the XP for a simple hazard is one-fifth of that. Hazards of a lower level than the party’s level – 4 are trivial and award no XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.598,r=0.859,b=0.755), with ID 17eb6585-0a59-4dca-9b54-e46304f7ef27 -->

Action Type logo: circular arrow or logo: diamond with exclamation mark This is the reaction or free action the hazard uses; Trigger The trigger that sets off the hazard appears here; Effect For a simple hazard, this effect is often all the hazard does. For a complex hazard, this might also cause the hazard to roll initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.434,r=0.513,b=0.509), with ID 173399bf-a259-47b6-ad78-e76fd17b6c65 -->

Routine This entry describes what a complex hazard does
on each of its turns during an encounter; the number in
parentheses after the word “Routine” indicates how many
actions the hazard can use each turn. Simple hazards don’t
have this entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.510,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID 2077cea4-4616-43a8-9cfc-88fc2723d6be -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration showing a dramatic scene inside a stone-vaulted hall with arched windows, through which a fiery, apocalyptic landscape is visible. The main subject is a floating, glowing red orb labeled "ARMAGEDDON ORB" at the bottom of the image.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The setting is a large, empty stone hall with high vaulted ceilings and multiple columns.
  • Three large arched windows on the left and back walls reveal an intense, fiery sky with orange and yellow flames, suggesting destruction outside.
  • The main subject is a red, glowing orb floating above the floor near the center-right, with a swirling red trail beneath it.
  • The lighting is dramatic, with warm tones from the fire outside casting light and shadows inside the hall.
  • The color palette is dominated by reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, enhancing the sense of heat and chaos.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  • The only visible text is "ARMAGEDDON ORB" in a gold-bordered label at the bottom center.
  • The orb is rendered with a glossy, swirling surface and appears to be the focal point of the composition.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The orb is positioned slightly right of center, floating above the tiled floor.
  • The windows and columns create depth, with the fiery exterior providing a dramatic backdrop.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the orb and windows drawing the viewer's eye.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of impending doom or cataclysm, with the "Armageddon Orb" as a central, possibly supernatural or magical, element.
  • The contrast between the calm, structured interior and the chaotic, fiery exterior heightens the drama.
  • The orb's placement and glow make it the clear focal point, suggesting it is the source or key to the destruction outside. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.102,t=0.602,r=0.534,b=0.963), with ID 5af2fb29-8091-4768-a008-ec9fc6264737 -->

Level  
The hazard’s level indicates what level of party it’s a good challenge for. If the hazard involves a toxin, curse, or other non-spell feature, that feature’s level is the hazard’s level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.139,r=0.904,b=0.219), with ID 146561e0-b84d-43ee-a31e-0a2a73273140 -->

**Traits**  
The most notable hazard traits are trap (constructed to harm intruders), environmental (natural hazards), and haunt (spectral phenomena). Traps have a trait to indicate whether they’re magical or mechanical. Hazards that have initiative and a routine have the complex trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.230,r=0.904,b=0.342), with ID 0cc57c8e-9b40-4fc0-bdb6-08de2ffd711f -->

Stealth or Stealth DC  
Complex hazards list their Stealth modifier, which they use for initiative, instead of their Stealth DC. If you need the DC, it’s equal to this modifier + 10. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.353,r=0.902,b=0.419), with ID 4902282e-e0c2-4fd0-a560-a5b1efaa6f61 -->

Simple Hazards  
A simple hazard uses its reaction only once, after which its threat is over unless the hazard is reset. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.429,r=0.902,b=0.479), with ID 0f001579-903d-4b65-8642-5a964ebd92f5 -->

Infinite Pitfall Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor;
Effect The triggering creature falls in and continues to fall, potentially forever. That creature can try to Grab an Edge to avoid falling (Player Core 419). The DC to Climb the walls or Grab an Edge is 26.

The pit contains many handholds, so the falling creature can try to Grab an Edge again every 6 seconds. If the creature succeeds, it can start to Climb out from that point (though it might be a very long climb, depending on how far the creature fell). Since the creature falls endlessly, it can rest and even prepare spells while falling, though items dropped while falling are usually lost forever.

Reset The trap still causes creatures to fall forever if they fall in, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.350,r=0.474,b=0.741), with ID 2be77435-db71-4309-9235-8f31101c0a67 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a large, ornate pipe organ with golden pipes and gothic architectural features, overlaid by translucent, ghostly figures that appear to be emerging from or standing in front of the organ.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a pipe organ with tall, gold-coloured pipes set in a dark wooden, gothic-style frame with pointed spires.
  • Superimposed are several semi-transparent, spectral human figures, rendered in pale blue-green hues, giving a ghostly effect.
  • The perspective is frontal, focusing on the upper half of the organ and the apparitions.
  • Lighting is diffuse, with the ghostly figures appearing to emit a faint glow, contrasting with the darker, solid organ.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration uses a limited palette: gold, brown, and blue-green.
  • No visible background details; the focus is entirely on the organ and apparitions.
