The image is used as cover art for the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" book.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 Main subject is a large, dark-sailed ship struggling against massive, curling ocean waves.\n  \u2022 The ship is tilted at a steep angle, with crew members visible on deck bracing themselves or holding onto rigging.\n  \u2022 The background features a turbulent, stormy sky with a prominent lightning bolt illuminating the left side.\n  \u2022 The color palette is dominated by dark blues, greens, and purples, emphasizing the stormy, perilous atmosphere.\n  \u2022 The upper left corner includes a stylized dragon illustration and the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" title.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.\n  \u2022 The illustration is highly detailed, with visible rain streaks, foaming water, and intricate ship rigging.\n  \u2022 No on-image UI elements or additional text beyond the book title.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 The ship occupies the lower right and central portion of the image, with the bow facing leftward into the waves.\n  \u2022 The largest wave is cresting on the right, threatening to engulf the ship.\n  \u2022 Lightning and the brightest part of the sky are on the left, providing dramatic backlighting.\n  \u2022 The dragon illustration and title are in the upper left, separated from the main scene by a border.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The illustration conveys a sense of danger, chaos, and high adventure, fitting for a fantasy roleplaying game.\n  \u2022 The composition draws the viewer\u2019s eye from the lightning on the left, across the stormy sea, to the imperiled ship and its crew.\n  \u2022 The use of dark colors and dynamic lines (rain, waves, rigging) enhances the feeling of movement and urgency.",

A gentle reminder of how the rule, spell, or ability in question functions is usually enough to move past the situation. Every once in a great while, you\u2019ll encounter a player who is deliberately cheating. The spirit of roleplaying is one of cooperative storytelling and overcoming challenges together, so one player cheating steals fun from every other player at the table. It\u2019s natural to feel some anger in this situation, so make sure you let some time pass between when you discover that a player is cheating and when you address it with them.",

However, they can also run into trouble when the PCs have gaps in their abilities. In many cases, the easiest way to adjust for a small group is to add additional characters. This could come in the form of allowing each player to play two characters or adding hirelings and support NPCs to the party to shore up roles that the PCs don\u2019t fill. When adding GM-controlled NPCs to the party, it\u2019s important to be sure that the PCs remain the stars of the show. In general, GM-controlled characters shouldn\u2019t make major decisions, and they shouldn\u2019t outshine PCs at their primary skills or roles. You can also use variant rules like free archetypes (page 84), extra treasure, or even just a few bonus trained skills to help improve the PCs\u2019 overall flexibility.",

However, they also divide the GM\u2019s attention. Large groups also need to set ground rules for how many players need to be present for the game to run when some players are missing. Recaps at the beginning of each session are crucial to keep everyone on the same page. Delegation is one of your most powerful tools to keep the session running smoothly. For example, you can put the players in charge of recapping the events from the previous session, handling initiative, managing the party\u2019s treasury, looking up rules, or helping with accessories like props and music. Also consider which tasks really need to be taken care of while everyone is there. For example, you could ask your players to handle selling items, deciding which common items they want to buy, and leveling up between sessions instead of at the table.",

For instance, an orc named Graytusk is unique, but that doesn\u2019t mean it would be any harder for a PC encountering her to tell she\u2019s an orc\u2014just to discern specific information about her.",

Tell the player they can look it up when it isn\u2019t their turn, and you\u2019ll play it as written after that, but that the game needs to move on in the meantime. It\u2019s okay to look up something that\u2019s both significant and heavily rules-dependent, such as a spell description or the death and dying rules. Even then, reciting a full chunk of rules text can pull players out of the flow of play, so feel free to summarize. It also helps to train your players to look things up in advance if they think they\u2019ll need them, so they\u2019re ready to go when their turns come around. This can be tough as a GM since it\u2019s essentially always your turn.

If a mount is knocked out, the rider might be able to dismount without trouble if the mount was stationary, but if they were in motion, you should probably have the rider attempt a Reflex save.

This way, no one is surprised to suddenly find out the ceiling is lower than they thought or tall trees create a barrier. Be careful about using aerial combat before PCs have magic that lets them fly. Be especially careful with flying foes who use ranged attacks because PCs might not have many good tools to fight them.",

The scene is viewed from within a large cavern or opening, looking outward and upward toward the city structures.\n\nphoto:  \nScene Overview :  \n  \u2022 The main subject is a vast, multi-tiered architectural complex built into a rocky cliff, featuring numerous arches, columns, and terraces.  \n  \u2022 The setting is arid and mountainous, with warm, golden sunlight filtering through the opening at the top, casting dramatic shadows and highlights.  \n  \u2022 The composition is dynamic, with the viewer's perspective from inside a cave or shaded area, looking out toward the sunlit city.  \n  \u2022 The color palette consists of warm earth tones\u2014yellows, oranges, and browns\u2014contrasted by the dark shadows of the cave interior.\n\nTechnical Details :  \n  \u2022 No scale bar or explicit measurement references are present.  \n  \u2022 The illustration style is detailed and semi-realistic, with careful attention to architectural and environmental features.  \n  \u2022 No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :  \n  \u2022 Foreground: Two figures stand at the cave's edge\u2014one on the left in armor holding a spear, and one on the right in draped robes.  \n  \u2022 Midground: Suspended wooden platforms or lifts hang from ropes, suggesting vertical movement between levels.  \n  \u2022 Background: The city extends upward, with multiple levels of arches and structures carved into the rock, culminating in a sunlit opening at the top.  \n  \u2022 The scene uses strong perspective lines, drawing the eye from the dark foreground to the illuminated city and sky above.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  \u2022 The illustration conveys a sense of mystery and grandeur, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the ancient city.  \n  \u2022 The interplay of light and shadow highlights the architectural details and the verticality of the space.  \n  \u2022 The presence of figures and suspended platforms suggests human activity and the use of mechanical means to traverse the city's heights.  \n  \u2022 The overall mood is one of awe and discovery, as if the viewer is encountering a lost or hidden civilization.",

For instance, they might be ambushed by bandits if they were flaunting their wealth or showing off expensive items earlier in the session, or they might be counterattacked by enemies if they attack the enemies first, only to retreat to rest. If the PCs set up camp hastily and decide not to set a watch, they might be in trouble if they\u2019re attacked.

In a roleplaying game, information and time are linked. Time will seem to slow down the more detail you give. Think cinematically!

The easiest method is to select a simple DC from the Simple DCs table on page 53 by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task). If it\u2019s something pretty much anyone would have a decent chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information, so you\u2019d set the DC at 30\u2014the simple master DC.",
