Disable DC 42 Intimidation (expert) three times to frighten dancers and spectral musicians alike away from participating in the deadly performance, DC 40 Performance (master) twice to produce a tune discordant enough to disrupt the compulsion, or DC 42 Religion (master) three times to banish the spirits with prayers <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.157,r=0.515,b=0.248), with ID cb345deb-d56c-453a-9c71-8a5f7f899136 -->

Prelude üîÑ (auditory, incapacitation, mental, occult) Trigger A creature approaches within 30 feet of the orchestra; Effect The orchestra compels all creatures that can hear it to begin dancing. Each creature must attempt a DC 41 Will save, with the following effects. The haunt then rolls initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.249,r=0.514,b=0.326), with ID 8c0f6446-9f1b-45eb-8f22-aebab8a6f4fd -->

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is off-guard and cannot use reactions. Additionally, it must spend 1 of its actions each round dancing. Dancing is a move action that allows the creature to Stride up to half its Speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.327,r=0.513,b=0.403), with ID d3f5cb33-64be-4e76-977c-88846e3ebb72 -->

Routine (1 action; auditory, incapacitation, mental, occult) The orchestra performs a raucous tune, compelling all creatures that can hear it to spend actions dancing. Each round, creature must attempt a DC 37 Will save; the results of this save modify the number of actions that the creature must spend dancing each round. If this would cause the creature to spend more actions dancing than it can use on its turn, the creature takes 10d6 damage (or double that on a critical failure) from moving faster than its body can manage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.464,r=0.514,b=0.602), with ID 218e6152-3c18-4ab5-a7e7-7d2ce75b636f -->

DROWNING PIT                                      HAZARD 3
COMPLEX  MECHANICAL  TRAP
Stealth +10 (trained); DC 22 (expert) to notice the water spouts once the pit opens
Description A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that‚Äôs 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.750,r=0.513,b=0.891), with ID cc7d3cc2-f8f8-4c6f-b306-046196a5aa34 -->

Pitfall üîÑ Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor; Effect The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can Grab an Edge to avoid falling (Player Core 419). The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.142,r=0.903,b=0.233), with ID ea8d9166-4b68-4126-bc9f-bcc1c97ddf2f -->

Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap‚Äôs actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning (Player Core 437). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.234,r=0.903,b=0.325), with ID 1d430402-55e8-4742-ac64-2d23afce8829 -->

**Reset** The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks are refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders the pit less effective. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.326,r=0.903,b=0.387), with ID 6b8ad954-51e9-49bb-8616-063ecb34ce62 -->

ETERNAL FLAME                                    HAZARD 7
COMPLEX  HAUNT
Stealth +18 (expert)
Description A raging spectral inferno arises out of thin air, strengthening all undead creatures within its area. This haunt most often arises from the charred remains of a group of three people who burned to death, whether in a terrible accident or a deliberate execution, and their unavenged souls burn with rage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.398,r=0.904,b=0.539), with ID f68ee6c5-07d2-4b2d-b9a3-9bf6a31817ba -->

**Disable** DC 27 Diplomacy (expert) to temporarily calm the rage of one of the three spirits, or DC 30 Religion (trained) to exorcise one of the spirits; three total successes are required to disable the haunt <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.541,r=0.903,b=0.601), with ID 9cac77a6-2022-4f31-8435-1f3ec3bd461d -->

Searing Agony üîÅ (mental) Trigger A living creature approaches within 10 feet of the remains of a victim of the original fire; Effect Memories of the pain suffered by the fire‚Äôs past victims assault the triggering creature‚Äôs mind. The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save, and the haunt then rolls initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.602,r=0.904,b=0.692), with ID 2ea2bc72-39ba-42bd-9193-69d362733c1c -->

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is sickened 1.

Critical Failure The creature is sickened 3, and it is off-
  guard for as long as it remains within the haunt‚Äôs area
  and for 3 rounds thereafter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.694,r=0.902,b=0.784), with ID 887d0c93-9d43-42b6-aba2-de4ad84952b2 -->

Routine (1 action) Phantom flames rage across the haunted area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each living creature within the area (DC 23 basic Will save). Undead creatures in the area are infused with flames for the following round. They gain the fire trait and immunity to fire, and all their attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. Objects in the area are unaffected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.785,r=0.902,b=0.891), with ID b6eb7f40-485a-417b-8210-71a2a782233c -->

Routine (3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+10 slashing damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a DC 33 Reflex save. Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the haunt‚Äôs movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.312,r=0.472,b=0.432), with ID 077ab9d2-9979-467a-a2fc-f348403f0795 -->

Routine (1 action) The trap launches one dart against every creature in the gallery as 1 action. Because it launches darts continuously, the trap can also use the Continuous Barrage free action (see below) to launch darts at each creature during that creature‚Äôs turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.784,r=0.470,b=0.861), with ID 973bc05a-f1b9-4856-9319-8b10efa6afb3 -->

QUICKSAND                                    HAZARD 3
COMPLEX  ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth +12 (trained) (or ‚Äì10 and no minimum proficiency if the
  surface is disturbed)
Description A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts
  to submerge creatures that step onto it.
Disable DC 18 Survival (trained) to disturb the surface
Submerge  Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto
  the quicksand; Effect The triggering creature sinks into the
  quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it
  hasn‚Äôt already. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.182,r=0.861,b=0.355), with ID 1d9dee45-d0d7-4f0a-a4a1-fd85589bc07b -->

Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation (Player Core 437). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.356,r=0.861,b=0.448), with ID 7297ea6f-3e7d-4b3d-8d70-ad5faf2dc6c0 -->

A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it‚Äôs submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it‚Äôs submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.495,t=0.448,r=0.862,b=0.616), with ID 4639dffa-3e0f-4657-a701-e65898d1af27 -->

Disable DC 21 Thievery (trained) twice on the pillar, or DC 19 Thievery (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents the trap from deactivating automatically (see Reset below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.785,r=0.860,b=0.877), with ID b55122b5-cff8-497f-b88b-a0d759e98b42 -->

Summary : This is an illustration of a large, stone-mounted wheel labeled "WHEEL OF MISERY," divided into six colored segments, each bearing a distinct symbol. The wheel is being struck by magical pink lightning, suggesting activation or supernatural influence.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a circular wheel embedded in a stone wall, with a metal rim and six equally sized segments.
  ‚Ä¢ Each segment contains a unique symbol: a bull's head, a lightning bolt, a bird in flight, a white serpent or eel, a falling humanoid silhouette, and a crescent moon.
  ‚Ä¢ The wheel is labeled at the bottom with a plaque reading "WHEEL OF MISERY."
  ‚Ä¢ Pink lightning arcs from the upper right, striking the wheel and illuminating the scene with a magical effect.
  ‚Ä¢ The setting is a stone platform with carved patterns and a small stone step in the foreground.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration uses a muted, earthy color palette for the stone and wheel, contrasted by the bright, glowing pink lightning.
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image UI elements or additional text beyond the plaque.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The wheel is centrally placed, dominating the composition.
  ‚Ä¢ The lightning originates from the upper right, drawing attention to the top right segment of the wheel.
  ‚Ä¢ The stone platform and wall provide a grounded, ancient setting, with the wheel slightly angled toward the viewer.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image conveys a sense of danger, fate, or supernatural judgment, with the "Wheel of Misery" suggesting random or ominous outcomes.
  ‚Ä¢ The magical lightning emphasizes the activation or importance of the wheel, possibly indicating a moment of decision or consequence.
  ‚Ä¢ The distinct symbols on each segment imply different possible results or effects, reinforcing the theme of chance and risk. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.053,t=0.571,r=0.598,b=0.943), with ID a23ec5d9-8d4d-4ef0-80ca-10ba6733cb9d -->

# BUILDING HAZARDS

*Building hazards designed for your game allows you to customize them to match your story, location, and needs, as well as to surprise the other players at every turn. There‚Äôs no wrong way to create a hazard, but this guide presents the information in the order you might see it in a hazard stat block.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.862,b=0.179), with ID 49e5921f-7ebf-4f86-8723-52cbd74a21aa -->

Concept
The first thing you‚Äôll need is a concept for your hazard. What level is your hazard? Will it be simple or complex? Is it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something else? If it‚Äôs a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both? This is a good time to brainstorm the hazard‚Äôs name and description, as this will help you decide how the hazard can be disabled. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.211,r=0.471,b=0.329), with ID e5d7d72a-e9e4-4341-b366-eaf8ca20c2be -->

## Hazard Types
The three main types of hazards are traps, environmental hazards, and haunts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.337,r=0.470,b=0.386), with ID 743ec4dd-bba8-491d-b649-24f6e9813f42 -->

Traps are usually built or placed. They can also form
accidentally, such as if a magic portal, through millennia of
disuse, malfunctions as its magic warps. Mechanical traps
always have some physical component, whereas purely
magical traps typically don‚Äôt. Magical traps can usually be
counteracted by *dispel magic*, and those without a listed
proficiency rank for Stealth can be found using *detect magic*.
Thievery is the most common skill used to disable traps. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.388,r=0.471,b=0.509), with ID 8e8e5211-12eb-409a-8017-2afedc8e7301 -->

Environmental hazards are either living things, like
dangerous spores and molds, or simply features of the
terrain or environment, like avalanches or rockslides.
While they are always physical, some environmental
hazards can't reasonably be attacked or damaged, such
as a cloud of poisonous gas or a patch of quicksand.
Survival is the most common skill used to disable
environmental hazards. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.509,r=0.470,b=0.632), with ID 8578d2bd-966a-4f75-985b-22e6c649c918 -->

Haunts are spiritual hazards, usually formed when the spiritual essence of a location is imprinted with the instincts and emotions from a living being‚Äôs demise. Because haunts lack matter, they rarely involve a physical component, and when they do, that component is generally incorporeal or might even be damaged only by vitality energy. The skills and options used to disable haunts vary, though using Religion for an exorcism is common. However, even with a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine what it would take to lay it to rest permanently. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.633,r=0.470,b=0.832), with ID 1e9923e0-0dc9-4eb2-b357-aa3fefd46529 -->

# UNDERSTANDING AND CHOOSING STATISTICS
Statistics determine how your hazard interacts with the game world, representing how dangerous it is and how hard it is to render harmless or circumvent. The statistics for your hazard <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.841,r=0.458,b=0.940), with ID 67b3b33a-a019-449b-a51b-e6f2e4b571a7 -->

can have extreme, high, or low values. You will want to
choose the value that is most appropriate for the concept
of your hazard, while ensuring that it is well balanced to
ensure a fun encounter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.219,r=0.863,b=0.280), with ID 2bff071b-dc62-4c75-bb24-4273b6c1d270 -->

**Extreme:** The hazard is world class in this statistic and can challenge almost any character. Almost all hazards have one extreme statistic because hazards normally activate only if they have gone unnoticed or if someone critically failed to disable them. Does it have an extreme Stealth DC that makes it incredibly hard to find, an extreme Disable DC that makes it perilous to disable, or an extreme save DC that makes it deadly in the event it triggers? These are the most common choices, as each affects a different phase of encountering the hazard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.281,r=0.863,b=0.433), with ID 12361eff-7a33-4c51-8bc3-419dd88dc7f7 -->

**High:** Extremely capable but not world class, the hazard presents a challenge for most characters. This is a capable level, and can generally serve as a baseline value. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.433,r=0.862,b=0.479), with ID 4581a686-0a93-42f5-a526-88be18331d3a -->

**Low:** If a hazard has a weakness, like a poor Reflex save for a bulky mechanical trap or an easy DC to disable <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.479,r=0.862,b=0.511), with ID cd1190cc-a39e-49c6-aee6-adc79cd9985e -->

Summary : This is a color illustration of a kneeling female character, likely a fantasy or role-playing game adventurer, surrounded by tools and equipment on a cobblestone surface.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a muscular woman kneeling on cobblestones, holding a metal tool in one hand and a spiked metal ring in the other.
  ‚Ä¢ She wears a sleeveless shirt, dark pants, and bracers on both forearms.
  ‚Ä¢ A belt with pouches, a sheathed dagger, and various tools is strapped around her waist.
  ‚Ä¢ The setting is a top-down or slightly angled perspective, focusing on the character and her immediate surroundings.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette is earthy, with browns, greys, and muted reds.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration is detailed, with visible textures on clothing, tools, and the cobblestone ground.
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image text or UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The character is centrally placed, occupying most of the image.
  ‚Ä¢ Tools and objects are scattered around her: a toolkit with picks, a cog, a screwdriver, a folded cloth, a pouch, and a sheathed dagger.
  ‚Ä¢ The foreground is filled with equipment, while the background is minimal, focusing attention on the subject.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image conveys the character‚Äôs preparedness and skill with tools, suggesting a role such as a rogue, tinkerer, or mechanic.
  ‚Ä¢ The arrangement of tools and the character‚Äôs posture imply she is in the process of working on a mechanical or lock-related task.
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration emphasizes resourcefulness and readiness, typical of an adventurer archetype. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.463,t=0.522,r=0.878,b=0.972), with ID cb63a05e-3fb6-4e5e-81da-32dd6f9df5cc -->

STEALTH AND DISABLE  
When determining a hazard‚Äôs combat statistics, first decide how the hazard can be located and how hard it is to disable. A hazard where the main challenge is how difficult it is to find, like the hidden pit, might have a very different effect for its level than a hazard out in plain sight, daring a PC to try to disable it, like the armageddon orb. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.153,r=0.515,b=0.281), with ID 48a126de-21e9-4579-80e3-0bbed4c519c4 -->

When deciding how your hazard is disabled, come up
with a narrative description of how it would happen,
which will inform which methods and skills disable
the hazard. You‚Äôll need to decide the proficiency rank
necessary to find the hazard as well as disable it with
each method. Remember, a hazard without a listed
rank next to its Stealth DC is obvious enough that
creatures can find it without Searching, and magical
hazards without a listed rank are not normally protected
against detect magic. Most hazards built by intelligent
creatures are concealed and have at least a trained rank.
The Minimum Proficiency table indicates the high and
moderate proficiency requirements by level; you can use <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.739,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 40303fa7-1ada-4b62-8f94-1f5528d3335c -->

lower proficiency ranks than the ones listed, and if you
use the high rank, consider a secondary, perhaps less-
efficient method to disable the hazard using a lower
rank. For instance, the bloodthirsty urge haunt (page
100) can be disabled with master Religion, or by a
higher DC with expert Diplomacy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.080,r=0.905,b=0.173), with ID 83a143c0-f814-4b12-bc71-8833ee61ea9a -->

If you need a Stealth modifier for a complex hazard,
just subtract 10 from the listed DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.173,r=0.904,b=0.204), with ID 0e9401d5-2b46-47ef-9c79-f46705608ab0 -->

Some hazards, even high-level ones, don‚Äôt make sense with a high Hardness value. In those cases, you can skip the Hardness and use the HP values from table 2‚Äì7: Hit Points on page 63.

**OFFENSE**
Almost all hazards need an attack bonus or a save DC, and hazards that deal damage need to list a damage value. Simple hazards deal about twice as much damage as complex hazards and have a very high attack bonus (abbreviated as S. Atk in the table). Complex hazards usually have more moderate attack bonuses (abbreviated as C. Atk in the table). You can adjust them further using the Attack Bonus table on page 120 if your hazard needs it. Simple hazard DCs aren‚Äôt as high for their level as their attack bonuses are, since effects with DCs usually have some effect even on a successful saving throw; use the EDC and HDC columns for extreme and hard DCs in the table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.197,r=0.474,b=0.418), with ID dba4a189-643b-4111-804f-95157e3a1b60 -->

The damage columns on the table give a damage expression you can use, followed by the average damage in parentheses. If you want to make your own damage expression, remember that average damage is 2.5 for a d4, 3.5 for a d6, 4.5 for a d8, 5.5 for a d10, and 6.5 for a d12. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.418,r=0.474,b=0.497), with ID 4b69db9d-55c5-4b32-a6b4-0f49689e3677 -->

# DESIGNING SIMPLE HAZARDS
When designing a simple hazard, make sure to select an appropriate trigger and effect. Often, a simple hazard that merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump that slows down the game without much added value, so think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both in the story and in the game world, especially when it‚Äôs a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed in that location. A great simple hazard does something interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in some way (you can find more information on integrating hazards with encounters on page 78). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.073,r=0.866,b=0.298), with ID a474b7c2-4106-4dfa-8710-bdb32487bb30 -->

# DESIGNING COMPLEX HAZARDS
Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when designing a simple hazard don‚Äôt apply when designing a complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim, and isn‚Äôt intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.304,r=0.868,b=0.464), with ID 121d54d1-ffe3-452c-ad21-2bef8e61e3da -->

A good complex hazard often requires disabling
multiple components or otherwise interacting with
the encounter in some way. For instance, while the
poisoned dart gallery (page 107) requires only one
Thievery check to disable, the control panel is on the
far end of the gallery, so a PC would need to make their
way across first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.464,r=0.868,b=0.575), with ID f373520c-64d8-4885-a2fc-92ba4a38a427 -->

Building Routines  
A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap, instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each round shouldn‚Äôt be able to seek out and precisely target only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within range or everything within range, depending on how you describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be able to recognize life force and target living creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.581,r=0.867,b=0.771), with ID 7b5188cc-0999-458e-a2d5-7a92fae61f7d -->

If you create a hazard that can‚Äôt consistently attack
the PCs (like the blade pillar, which moves in a random
direction), you can make it deadlier than normal in
other ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.770,r=0.867,b=0.832), with ID 0a9066fd-4cca-4ea9-85c9-ba10ba638a63 -->

The hazard should have as many actions as you feel
it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine
out into several actions, you can also remove some of
the hazard‚Äôs actions once partial progress is made in
disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling
of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the
hazard if it appears in an encounter alongside creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.832,r=0.866,b=0.942), with ID 412ecefa-989a-46e5-bf09-2e54d19320c5 -->

# BUILDING CREATURES

*Making your own creatures fleshes out your game world and lets you introduce concepts not yet available in published products like Monster Core and similar volumes. These guidelines help you customize creatures to your specifications and explore your imagination. From strange beasts to canny political rivals, you have the power to design creatures that fit the narrative needs of your story.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.077,r=0.909,b=0.200), with ID 38afcfdf-f18c-4a23-9df7-656b2d30699b -->

Creatures aren‚Äôt built the same way PCs are. The rules for
building them are more flexible, and their statistics are
based on benchmark final numbers rather than combining
each individual modifier together. This is called top-down
design, in which you consider the design process as a whole
and select the details that reflect your intended result, rather
than building statistics from the bottom up and hoping the
finished creature matches your vision. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.233,r=0.514,b=0.356), with ID c4016960-a769-4904-9acb-da61871377d1 -->

This guide provides a step-by-step process to build

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting an undead or vampiric elf-like creature wielding a sword, with glowing red eyes and a menacing expression.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a humanoid creature with pointed ears, long white hair, and grayish skin.
  ‚Ä¢ The creature has glowing red eyes and an open-mouthed snarl, revealing sharp teeth.
  ‚Ä¢ It is draped in a tattered, dark cloak and wears minimal, ragged clothing.
  ‚Ä¢ A large, blood-red gem or wound is visible on its chest.
  ‚Ä¢ The figure is holding a long sword, point-down, with both hands.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is mostly blank, focusing attention on the character.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The lighting is dramatic, with highlights on the hair and face, and deep shadows on the cloak and limbs.
  ‚Ä¢ The colour palette is dominated by grays, blacks, and muted greens, with striking red accents in the eyes and chest.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The creature is positioned in a dynamic, forward-leaning stance, suggesting aggression or readiness to attack.
  ‚Ä¢ The sword is planted in the ground, anchoring the figure.
  ‚Ä¢ The cloak billows to the left, adding a sense of movement.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration conveys a sense of menace and supernatural power, emphasizing the creature's undead or vampiric nature through its gaunt features, glowing eyes, and dramatic pose.
  ‚Ä¢ The use of red highlights draws attention to the eyes and chest, reinforcing the creature's otherworldly and dangerous qualities. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.410,r=0.527,b=0.964), with ID 92334fb8-352c-4cab-bef4-4c348fa7b0f1 -->

could start with one ability you think is cool, or you might
look to create a spellcaster of a certain type. There's no
wrong starting place or wrong way to compile and present
your creation; some GMs prefer to generate a stat block
that is as similar to an official *Monster Core* entry as
possible, while others prefer just a brief set of notes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.235,r=0.904,b=0.327), with ID 5c7aa30d-1c8e-4441-b253-3276572c5357 -->

DEVELOP THE CONCEPT  
To begin, come up with the creature‚Äôs concept. You likely already have the basic idea. As you add details to the general idea, taking notes can help keep your creature on track. Consider the parts of your creature you find most compelling and want to emphasize when the creature hits the table. For example, in Monster Core, demons are creatures of sin and are designed to have weaknesses against specific virtues that oppose them. Satyrs enchant creatures by playing their pipes, represented by their centerpiece ability, Play the Pipes. Note your creature‚Äôs core aspects, and if you feel uncertain later, you can look back and ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes this emphasize a core aspect or not?‚Äù <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.337,r=0.905,b=0.539), with ID 6b185ee2-0841-420d-9110-450f6e3fcf5f -->

Next, look at the creature‚Äôs role in your game. Is it
meant to be a combatant? A social creature? A trusted
ally? Figuring this out will help you determine whether to
give it strong combat abilities or to focus on skills, spells,
and special abilities. Think about how the creature might
behave if it‚Äôs in a fight, if someone tries to talk to it, or if
it‚Äôs in a social situation. Does it work better alone or with
allies? What sort of character should be best at facing it or
be particularly weak against it? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.541,r=0.904,b=0.677), with ID aec35624-76a8-4bcd-891e-fd089eed78e2 -->

Also consider the complexity of the creature. This
matters most when you plan to use a large number of
creatures of that type. If you‚Äôll use five at the same time,
you‚Äôll want their turns to move swiftly and avoid complex
special actions. A creature that is likely to face a group of
PCs alone can have more abilities, and it might need a more
versatile set of defenses against PC tactics. Cut complexity
as much as you can while retaining your desired theme. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.679,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID 766167aa-c9ad-4d05-913f-e1423d78d909 -->

Now, how do you want an encounter with this creature to
feel? Should it be scary? Mobile? Confusing? A mystical
duel or a knock-down, drag-out fight? What can you give
your creature to convey those characteristics? Much of this
feel will come from your choice of the creature‚Äôs special
abilities or spells, rather than its raw numbers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.802,r=0.902,b=0.892), with ID 424529e0-1d6c-4bf6-9574-e4cf8deee837 -->

With all this in mind, think about what specific abilities
your creature should have. Take a few notes now, and
get to the details later. You can use abilities from <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.535,t=0.893,r=0.902,b=0.938), with ID 02100212-212c-4e63-9fe9-ac606fa01376 -->

*Monster Core* or feats in *Player Core*, adjusting as needed, to save yourself time. It helps to think of a creature that‚Äôs similar to yours and see what makes it tick‚Äîand what you can steal from it.

Now that you understand your creature‚Äôs concept, it‚Äôs
time to get to the statistics. Remember that you can always
change your concept later on. Your creation might evolve
and transform as you go, so be open to change. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.159,r=0.473,b=0.221), with ID a8e841e5-d1e7-42a9-9ef2-adf0aaa81941 -->

# UNDERSTANDING STATISTICS
Most of the statistics in this section use a scale of extreme,
high, moderate, and low‚Äîsome use terrible values as well.

**Extreme:** The creature is world-class in this statistic and
can challenge almost any character. Most creatures have no
extreme statistics or only one extreme statistic, although
some creatures might have additional extreme statistics
and weaker related statistics elsewhere (a common example
being a creature trading accuracy for extreme damage).
Examples from *Monster Core* include the succubus‚Äôs
Diplomacy modifier and the lich‚Äôs spell DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.228,r=0.473,b=0.402), with ID 6042aaa5-9101-414e-b457-ca5d353a3cb8 -->

**High:** Extremely capable but not world-class, the creature presents a challenge for most characters. Just about all creatures have at least one high value. Most combat-focused creatures have high AC and either a high attack bonus and high damage, or a merely moderate attack bonus but extreme damage. An ogre warrior‚Äôs attack bonus and a kobold scout‚Äôs Stealth are high values. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.402,r=0.473,b=0.511), with ID b56b46a5-5279-4cf8-be88-914543ba9d44 -->

**Moderate:** A middle-of-the road statistic covers anything unremarkable about the creature. Use this one often. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.511,r=0.473,b=0.541), with ID a7c6f113-53d3-4485-b9cb-9139247ee74c -->

**Low:** The creature is actively bad at this. Choose these intentionally to represent the creature‚Äôs weak points. Most creatures should have at least one low statistic; an example is the goblin pyro‚Äôs Will save. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.541,r=0.472,b=0.602), with ID ade875dd-d2a2-40d1-aad3-88e6d12e154b -->

**Terrible:** Some statistics can dip even lower than low, to terrible. This indicates a truly awful statistic that still isn‚Äôt game-breakingly bad. A spider‚Äôs Intelligence is terrible, as is an ogre‚Äôs Will save. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.602,r=0.472,b=0.664), with ID 20065f39-aa7d-4df5-bd26-e46a60f1dd6f -->

Push and Pull  
Statistics should be balanced overall. That means if you‚Äôre giving a creature an extreme statistic, it should have some low or terrible statistics to compensate. For example, if you were making a creature extremely hard to hit by giving it an extreme AC, you‚Äôd likely give it lower saving throws or low HP. If a creature is great at spellcasting, it might need several low statistics to be a balanced challenge. There‚Äôs no perfect system for making these decisions. If you‚Äôve made a creature that has four high stats and nothing low, or vice-versa, take another look. A creature‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses change the PCs‚Äô strategies for dealing with it, and that‚Äôs what makes playing the game fun! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.672,r=0.473,b=0.880), with ID e12eb1b9-e905-4780-9e6c-8ed43f1b6e89 -->

**Extreme Increases**
At the higher levels of the game, PCs have more tools at their disposal, so the creatures they face need to hit back <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.887,r=0.474,b=0.943), with ID 51150bc2-920d-4df0-809b-92bf37041156 -->

BUILDING CREATURES OVERVIEW
This section details the creature-building process using the following steps.

1. Develop the Concept (page 112) Think about your creature, and make notes you can use in future steps.
2. Build the Stat Block Pick all the statistics for the creatures, going through the list below.
   Level (page 114)
   Size and Traits (page 114)
   Attribute Modifiers (page 114)
   Perception and Senses (page 115)
   Languages (page 116)
   Skills (page 116)
   Items, if necessary (page 116)
   AC (page 117)
   Saving Throws (page 118)
   Hit Points (page 118)
   Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances (page 119)
   Speed (page 119)
   Strikes, including their damage (page 119)
   Spells, if necessary (page 121)
3. Design Abilities (page 123) Create the special abilities your creature can use.
4. Review Holistically (page 125) Step back, take stock of your creature as a whole, and tweak as needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.075,r=0.858,b=0.484), with ID 965533c9-184e-4b0b-976f-3ca824914804 -->

TRAIT ABILITIES (PAGE 126)
This section provides the abilities conveyed by certain
traits, such as demon, dragon, and undead. You'll also
find abilities typical of creatures with those traits to help
guide you as you plan your creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.491,t=0.487,r=0.856,b=0.575), with ID 8b1e8b2b-9019-4176-985e-74b624413866 -->

## DESIGNING NPCS (PAGE 128)
Sometimes you‚Äôll design a creature that‚Äôs meant to have abilities or characteristics similar to those of a PC. Maybe you need a bold champion, a sly rogue master criminal, or a wizened druid elder for your game. You also might need a common baker, who has little combat ability but great skill with dough and an oven. This section provides ways you might modify aspects of the creature-building process to fit those needs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.494,t=0.578,r=0.855,b=0.726), with ID 79d82759-da90-4a90-8cc3-101679b1c0a6 -->

harder! At higher levels, give each creature more extreme
statistics. Having one extreme statistic becomes typical
around 11th level. A creature of 15th level or higher
typically has two extreme statistics, and one of 20th level
or higher should have three or four. Keep in mind that
these should be relevant to the encounters you expect them
to have‚Äîextreme social skills aren‚Äôt much use to a combat-
focused creature. Be careful about giving multiple extreme
statistics that are closely linked: a creature with extreme
damage and Fortitude saves is one thing, but having an
extreme attack bonus and extreme damage allows the
creature to apply both extreme statistics to each attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.752,r=0.864,b=0.942), with ID 1dc7c769-434b-4d9b-a924-a75a735a00e8 -->

# RESKINNING A CREATURE
Sometimes you need a creature with abilities that are almost exactly the same as those of a published creature. In that case, it can be more efficient to simply ‚Äúreskin‚Äù the old creature rather than design a new one‚Äîthat is, to change the description but keep the abilities mostly the same. Occasionally, reskinning requires small mechanical adjustments. For instance, a fire cat that has immunity to fire, an aura that deals fire damage, and the ability to light people on fire with its jaws to deal persistent fire damage could be reskinned as a caustic animate tree that has immunity to acid, an aura that deals acid damage, and branch attacks that smear acidic sap on a creature‚Äôs body when they hit, dealing persistent acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.074,r=0.513,b=0.325), with ID 6db45b2f-98ed-479d-9183-87e62da4c227 -->

LEVEL
For most creatures you build, their level depends on the level of the party that will encounter it. Look at other creatures you think are similar in power to yours to determine its level. Note that level represents a creature‚Äôs combat ability, so a creature that‚Äôs more social might have 3rd-level combat statistics and 6th-level skills, but it would remain a 3rd-level creature. Most such creatures are NPCs; for more information on this distinction and how to use it, see Non-Combat Level on page 128. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.336,r=0.515,b=0.509), with ID aaa088f2-c561-4c5e-b02f-3b3d55217a6e -->

Some abilities are hard for PCs to deal with at low
levels. For instance, creatures that can fly and have
ranged attacks should typically appear around 7th level,
when PCs gain access to flight. Natural invisibility or at-
will *invisibility* as an innate spell should come at around
6th level, when PCs are more likely to prepare *see the
unseen* in lower-rank spell slots, or 8th level, when some
PCs get the Blind-Fight feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.510,r=0.514,b=0.632), with ID 9c2eb6d9-fa8c-4a36-a6f4-227ac4e05699 -->

The tables in this chapter go up to 24th level‚Äîthe
highest-level extreme encounter a party might face. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.632,r=0.513,b=0.664), with ID d10fbbd4-0df9-42f8-bab0-9c9b721d1556 -->

## SIZE AND TRAITS
Fill out the trait line of your creature‚Äôs stat block. Creatures can be whatever size you need them to be, though you seldom find Large creatures below 1st level, Huge creatures below 5th level, or Gargantuan creatures below 10th level. Generally, you don‚Äôt automatically adjust statistics for size, except to Strength modifiers for Large and bigger creatures, which you‚Äôll find in the following Attribute Modifiers section. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.674,r=0.513,b=0.816), with ID 767b66dc-b184-49c4-9b5b-46e3d82cebbd -->

Your creature will almost certainly have one of the following traits to define its type: aberration, animal, astral, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, ethereal, fey, fiend, fungus, giant, humanoid, monitor, ooze, plant, or undead. If you‚Äôre making a creature from an existing category of a type, such as demon, it also has that category as a trait. Creatures with a close affinity to elements‚Äîair, earth, fire, metal, water and wood‚Äîor <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.817,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID ce8a5d0a-d6ec-439c-97aa-c650e2dea80f -->

types of energy‚Äîlike acid, cold, and electricity‚Äîhave  
those traits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.111), with ID d384f06d-2b6e-4ed4-89d3-d8f246a906ce -->

Some abilities that are typical of creatures with the
traits listed here can be found in Trait Abilities on page
126. As with the other steps, looking at similar creatures
will give you an idea of what traits to use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.112,r=0.904,b=0.172), with ID 9045a152-c7f2-45d4-a6a0-6b9810528081 -->

Add any traits that have detailed rules attached to
them, like amphibious, aquatic, incorporeal, mindless,
and swarm. You can add traits related to the creature
category, such as dinosaur or werecreature, but most
of these traits are pretty self-evident in play. If at any
point you realize during play that you didn‚Äôt add a trait
the creature really should have, you can usually apply
it retroactively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.173,r=0.904,b=0.295), with ID 06cf1507-33e9-4e96-8495-f3c46e35ce57 -->

## ATTRIBUTE MODIFIERS
Next, figure out your creature‚Äôs attribute modifiers, since these will suggest what their other statistics should be. You don‚Äôt have to determine the exact numbers, but it‚Äôs good to avoid creating creatures whose attribute modifiers are at odds with their abilities, like creatures with a terrible Wisdom modifier and a very high Perception. Most of the time, you‚Äôll just be using attribute modifiers for untrained skills, so they‚Äôre useful as a guide but not crucial. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.307,r=0.904,b=0.463), with ID 6f0db3ba-9831-4e50-8918-d2c42edaec75 -->

The Attribute Modifier Scales table shows some benchmarks for your creatures. Use high for the creature‚Äôs best attribute modifiers, moderate for ones they‚Äôre okay at, and low for the rest. If a creature has a truly bad ability, you can go as low as ‚Äì5. That‚Äôs the terrible range for attribute modifiers, and doesn‚Äôt really change by level. This is most common with animals, which have an Intelligence modifier of ‚Äì4 (for dogs, dolphins, and such) or ‚Äì5 (for more instinctual animals like spiders), and for mindless creatures, which have a ‚Äì5 Intelligence modifier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.465,r=0.903,b=0.631), with ID 72082cbb-94c7-405a-a827-2fb729d5c84d -->

Few creatures use the extreme column. A powerful,
dedicated spellcaster might use an extreme spellcasting
statistic, or a preternaturally charming creature like a
succubus or nymph might have an extreme Charisma
modifier. However, the most common way extreme
numbers are used is for really big, really strong creatures.
This happens with only Large or bigger creatures from
1st to 5th level, Huge or larger creatures from 6th to 9th
level, and Gargantuan creatures from 10th to 15th level.
Beyond that level, a creature doesn‚Äôt gain an extreme
Strength modifier from size alone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.634,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID 08096788-1546-411b-8475-7fabdeee27a9 -->

Perception

Perception is a fairly straightforward statistic. Use Wisdom as a guide for setting it, and adjust to the high side if your creature has acute senses or extra training. If your creature has low Wisdom, for example, it would probably have a low Perception modifier, or moderate if it‚Äôs supposed to be a great hunter. Don‚Äôt make your creature‚Äôs Perception higher just because it‚Äôs often used for initiative; creatures with poor Perception could use a skill check for initiative instead, such as Stealth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.398,r=0.472,b=0.558), with ID ac01452f-3df3-4c15-892d-64a6466a61f0 -->

Senses  
Choose or design any special senses for your creature, such as low-light vision, darkvision, or scent. If you‚Äôre making a sense from scratch, simply decide what it senses, whether it has a range limit, and whether it‚Äôs precise or imprecise. For example, a sinspawn has ‚Äúsin scent (imprecise) 30 feet.‚Äù This means it can smell creatures bearing its associated sin if they‚Äôre within 30 feet, and the sense is imprecise‚Äîabout as acute as human hearing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.567,r=0.471,b=0.711), with ID 3ae14408-f84a-4926-a501-eadea084db5c -->

## BASE ROAD MAPS
You can use the following suggestions to set the baseline when creating your road map. For example, use the brute for a big, tough creature like an ogre, and the skirmisher for a darting enemy. Each entry is a starting point you can customize as you see fit. Any core statistic that isn‚Äôt listed should typically use moderate numbers.

Summary : This image shows a user interface element displaying the number "115" inside a rectangular box, with decorative green and gold motifs above it.

screenshot:
Scene Overview : 
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a rectangular UI box with the number "115" in bold, centered within a tan background.
  ‚Ä¢ Above the box is a green area with symmetrical gold decorative motifs and a diamond shape in the center.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette consists of green, gold, and brown tones.

Technical Details : 
  ‚Ä¢ The number "115" is prominently displayed in a serif font.
  ‚Ä¢ The box has a slightly distressed or textured left edge.
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, magnification, or additional UI elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships : 
  ‚Ä¢ The number is centered horizontally within the box.
  ‚Ä¢ The decorative motif is directly above the box, suggesting a thematic or stylistic connection.

Analysis : 
  ‚Ä¢ The image likely represents a resource counter, score, or status indicator from a game or application interface, with the number "115" being the key value displayed. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.900,t=0.926,r=0.999,b=0.984), with ID a93d9f4e-4d36-45df-9bdc-e6471494cf21 -->

## CONVERTING FIRST EDITION CREATURES
If you're converting creatures from First Edition, you won't find a direct numerical conversion. Instead, use the original statistics to create your road map, giving a better AC to a creature that had a good AC in First Edition, and so on.
    Here are the main areas of difference that you'll want to keep in mind for your conversion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.148,t=0.085,r=0.500,b=0.202), with ID 292d8c79-74a9-474d-9cfb-7edab115a190 -->

- ‚Ä¢ Attribute modifiers scale differently, so don't copy them exactly. The highest modifiers tend not to get as high in Second Edition. You'll rarely see a +10 Strength modifier, for example. Creatures also tend to get better low statistics at higher levels than they used to, particularly for Dexterity and Wisdom. This is most apparent in high-level First Edition creatures with awful Dexterity.
- ‚Ä¢ Low-Intelligence creatures, particularly animals, tend to have more special actions than they would have in First Edition. This is to make encounters with them more dynamic and distinct. Compare dinosaurs between the editions for good examples. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.203,r=0.500,b=0.387), with ID 06685a46-5302-4dac-83a2-371446495de1 -->

‚Ä¢ When converting spell-like abilities to innate spells, you might need to make some substitutions. Some spells will appear as heightened versions of spells (such as greater dispel magic now being heightened dispel magic), but others will require you to find something different. Also, don‚Äôt feel like you need to keep every spell; focus on the most thematic and potent ones. The Spells section on page 121 has more advice on this subject. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.150,t=0.387,r=0.500,b=0.510), with ID 942ea665-bca5-4e1d-aecd-507d58cf3a28 -->

- ‚Ä¢ Damage reduction has been replaced with two options: resistance to all damage (possibly with exceptions), or more HP and a weakness. Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances on page 119 describes the distinction.
- ‚Ä¢ If you want to convert spell resistance, you can give the creature a +1 status bonus to all saves against magic, or +2 if it had abnormally high spell resistance for its level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.155,t=0.511,r=0.500,b=0.617), with ID 43c95445-4485-49da-9de4-adf57989f368 -->

# Languages
Think about what languages the creature would need to communicate with other creatures in its home. For instance, many intelligent undead speak Necril, and many creatures from the Darklands speak Sakvroth. If you want your creature to be able to speak to the PCs, be sure it has Common; for a creature with no reason to speak the common tongue of your setting (such as most extraplanar creatures in a typical campaign), be sure it doesn‚Äôt. Some creatures can understand language but can‚Äôt vocalize; in this case, you can state that they can‚Äôt speak any language. For creatures that need to be able to infiltrate and communicate wherever they go, you might give them truespeech or a similar ability as a constant innate spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.645,r=0.513,b=0.863), with ID 9120bf23-bc9c-467b-aece-32691bf2cdfe -->

Skills
You have lots of flexibility in setting your creature‚Äôs skills.
Pick some skills you think are appropriate, and consider
how good the creature is at them. High skills are roughly <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.874,r=0.512,b=0.941), with ID 3486cc11-f216-427f-b0b6-07507fa7cd09 -->

on par with a specialized PC of the creature‚Äôs level, though
they could be a little lower or higher. Most creatures have
at least one high skill, but no more than three. The best
skills should go with the best attribute modifiers, and you
might even want to estimate the creature‚Äôs proficiency
rank for these skills. Some skills can get a high bonus for
free to fit the creature‚Äôs theme, particularly Lore skills. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.187), with ID f84ee2b8-0329-4ac0-9b36-14206b1cbfc8 -->

Most creatures don‚Äôt have an extreme skill unless they are world-class for their level, like a succubus‚Äôs Diplomacy. Having an extreme skill is less impactful than having an extreme AC or attack bonus, but it still might warrant a sacrifice elsewhere, especially if the creature also has more high skills than usual. There‚Äôs no need for terrible skill modifiers, since an untrained skill usually represents that. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.189,r=0.903,b=0.295), with ID f2e20d96-8323-4904-8e17-2a91e95317f3 -->

**Special Modifiers**  
You can also add special, thematic modifiers for certain skill uses. For instance, you might give a creature that secretes adhesive ‚ÄúAthletics +7 (+9 to Climb or Grab).‚Äù This special bonus should still remain at or below the extreme number, especially if it has a combat purpose like the Grab bonus above. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.751,r=0.904,b=0.863), with ID 799ed61e-34e6-4de8-ab62-cc3535f1e8e7 -->

Items
If you gave a creature gear equivalent to a PC, your PCs would gain a huge amount of treasure by defeating a large group of them. Using the Safe Items table can help you <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.875,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID ff6f6908-2c3b-4aec-9234-3d51765e8409 -->

avoid that. A creature can have a single permanent item
of the listed level without issue. For example, if a 6th-level
creature has a +1 weapon, that item‚Äôs not worth enough that
the PCs would be massively rich if they encountered many
creatures of that type and sold everything they found. You
can give a creature several lower-level items too. Just pay
attention to your overall treasure as measured against the
Safe Item table below. At the lowest levels, a creature can
certainly have multiple level 0 items, even though normally
a creature should have only one item of the level listed in
the Safe Item Level column. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.248), with ID da293d65-597c-45e7-ae84-07737fe925ef -->

Specific creatures or NPCs have more leeway to break
these guidelines because you can plan the rest of your
adventure‚Äôs loot around them. Also, giving a boss a
powerful magic item makes the fight and its aftermath
more interesting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.249,r=0.471,b=0.326), with ID 3ab3d735-51a8-4fd6-a731-f5e75b9e3969 -->

## DEFENSES
Consider adjusting your creature‚Äôs HP, AC, and saves in tandem based on its theme. Almost no creature has great defenses in all areas, and such creatures often result in frustrating fights. A creature with extreme AC might mean reducing its HP to the next lowest category, or reducing its HP by a smaller amount and making another reduction elsewhere. On the other hand, a creature that‚Äôs easy to hit could have more HP and a strong Fortitude save to compensate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.705,r=0.470,b=0.863), with ID b4a4d267-bfc7-4061-8c0f-5f44f3c5e769 -->

Armor Class  
Because AC is one of the most important combat stats, you need to be more careful when setting this number for any creature you expect to end up in a fight. Low AC <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.874,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID 54f80281-f378-44fa-a307-40fa0452a522 -->

IMPROVISING A CREATURE
As you get more experienced, you might find that you don‚Äôt need to build some creatures in advance. In many cases, especially for simple creatures, you can just select values from the relevant tables on the fly and track its HP. When you do, track which value you used as it came up. For instance, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it‚Äôs time for initiative, you decide it has moderate Perception and jot down ‚ÄúPer +8.‚Äù Your group‚Äôs fighter beats it at initiative and attacks. You decide the soldier has high AC‚Äîlooking at the Armor Class table, you see that‚Äôs 18‚Äîand add this information to your note. The fighter‚Äôs Strike hits, and you select the low end of high HP: 36. Well, now it‚Äôs 25. Your note says ‚ÄúPer +8, AC 18, HP 25.‚Äù If it gets to take a turn, you can give it a Strike then. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.077,r=0.859,b=0.353), with ID 54a870ee-b24e-43b0-a82c-ba31f414514a -->

typically fits spellcasters, who compensate with their
selection of powerful spells. Most creatures use high or
moderate AC‚Äîhigh is comparable to what a PC fighter
would have. Reserve extreme AC for a creature that is
even better defended; these values are for creatures that
have defenses similar in power to those of a champion
or monk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.372,r=0.861,b=0.479), with ID 456a3a8f-6933-4313-95cc-e57d08a1fb8e -->

Summary : This image shows a user interface element from a game, displaying a numerical value (117) within a stylized box, accompanied by decorative motifs above.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is a rectangular UI box with the number "117" in large, bold, light-colored font.
  ‚Ä¢ Above the box is a green background with tan decorative motifs: two symmetrical abstract human-like shapes flanking a central diamond.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette is primarily green, tan, and brown.
Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The number "117" is clearly visible and centered within the box.

Saving Throws  
You can often set saves quickly by assigning one high, one moderate, and one low modifier. Some creatures might vary from this, either because they have poor AC but better saves or because they should thematically have multiple good saves and compensate elsewhere. You have more flexibility with saves, and having one save be 1 more or 1 less than the listed number is rarely a big deal. Pay attention to the creature‚Äôs Con, Dex, and Wis modifiers‚Äîthese don‚Äôt have to correspond to the creature‚Äôs saves exactly, but should inform your choices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.249), with ID fd410bf0-0832-4759-9f2e-925ef7f83ea9 -->

Extreme saves often pair with extreme or high
attribute modifiers. Almost no creature should have
more than one extreme save, even at high levels. Assign
terrible saves to creatures that have a clear weak point‚Äî
for example, a nearly immobile creature would have a
terrible Reflex save. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.250,r=0.515,b=0.343), with ID 9d487900-a2f4-4c82-8152-0ad049648e69 -->

Hit Points
Give a creature HP in the moderate range unless its theme strongly suggests it should use another range. Spellcasters, for example, often have low HP. Brutish creatures usually have high HP, compensating with lower AC, weaker saves, fewer tactical options, or other limitations. As mentioned in the Defenses section above, you don‚Äôt want a creature with extreme AC to have high HP too. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.796,r=0.515,b=0.940), with ID 50386b5b-23a8-44c3-8ddf-3ad41334fe3b -->

Hit Points are closely tied in with immunities, weaknesses,
and resistances, so if your creature has any of those, look at
that section before finalizing HP (page 119). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.128), with ID d1c62963-60b0-40d5-8baa-6baac9354f43 -->

Regeneration and Healing Abilities  
Your creature might have regeneration, fast healing, or some other ability to heal itself. These healing abilities can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast healing heals a number of hits each round‚Äîusually one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on the Strike Damage table (page 120) and multiply that value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy to overcome‚Äîand remember that most regeneration gets easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to decrease the creature‚Äôs total HP by double its regeneration value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it can‚Äôt prevent a creature‚Äôs death and there isn‚Äôt always a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.138,r=0.905,b=0.432), with ID ee352bc7-bd24-4362-9035-9ac1f7942ad8 -->

If a creature can use an ability that heals it, that ability
typically restores more HP since it costs actions. An at-
will healing ability should be based on a heal spell 2
ranks lower than the highest-rank spell a creature of
that level could ordinarily cast (for example, an 11th-
level creature can typically cast up to 6th-rank spells,
so you would base its healing ability on a 4th-rank heal
spell). If the ability both deals damage and heals, use
that same baseline scale from above but with vampiric
feast instead of heal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.434,r=0.905,b=0.587), with ID 33d3213e-9120-4bd4-be18-26941ad2c799 -->

## IMMUNITIES, WEAKNESSES, AND RESISTANCES
If it‚Äôs highly thematic for a creature to have an immunity, weakness, or resistance, consider adding it. The Resistances and Weaknesses table lists the ranges for weaknesses and resistances by level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.183,r=0.473,b=0.280), with ID ec43db12-f56f-4ec8-9a91-6d79ade477bd -->

Immunities are generally reserved for creatures made
of an unusual substance (like a fire elemental being
immune to fire). You can also give an immunity if a
creature‚Äôs biology or construction would logically cause
it to be unaffected (like a mindless creature‚Äôs immunity
to mental effects). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.280,r=0.471,b=0.371), with ID 55d9a187-2a4a-4440-9870-af3ef34d7dfa -->

If the creature should be hard to affect with something but the conditions above aren‚Äôt true, give it a resistance instead. For instance, a giant octopus isn‚Äôt actually made of cold water, so it wouldn‚Äôt be immune to cold, but its life in the ocean depths makes it resistant to cold. You‚Äôll typically use the lower end of the value on the Resistances and Weaknesses table for a broad resistance that applies to a wide range of effects, like ‚Äúphysical 5 (except silver)‚Äù and the higher end for something narrower, like a single damage type. A creature with a resistance, especially a broad resistance or a physical resistance, usually has fewer HP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.373,r=0.471,b=0.555), with ID 34f896a7-57c7-45be-9f2d-6ab3b8cdd35d -->

Giving your creature a weakness adds flavor to it
and greatly rewards effective player tactics once your
players identify the weakness. The weakness should
apply to one damage type or phenomenon and use the
high end of the scale. Creatures typically have at most
one weakness. If a creature has a weakness, especially
to something common, give it additional HP. The
amount of additional HP might depend on how tough
the creature should feel if the PCs don‚Äôt exploit its
weakness; a tough creature might have additional HP
equal to quadruple the weakness value. A creature with
a hard-to-exploit weakness might have additional HP
equal to the weakness value or less. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.557,r=0.471,b=0.755), with ID 87f70a50-13ed-438b-a18a-2f6768f85df6 -->

The combination of more HP and a weakness has a different feel from standard HP with resistances. If the creature being an impervious tank really fits its theme, use a resistance with an exception, such as ‚Äúphysical 5 (except silver).‚Äù If, however, it makes more sense for normal hits to get through and the creature to simply have great staying power, use more HP and a weakness. Skeletons and zombies are a good example of the difference between these styles. Skeletons have resistances because they‚Äôre bony and hard to hurt. Zombies, on the other hand, have more HP and a weakness to slashing damage‚Äîthey‚Äôre tougher, but their bodies aren‚Äôt built to deflect weapon attacks, and slashing attacks can rip them up quickly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.356,r=0.862,b=0.571), with ID b5f2b6b3-e7e4-4523-bb7d-57bc37550396 -->

### SPEED
Your creature‚Äôs Speed should be 25 feet if it moves like a human. Beyond that, you can set the Speed to whatever makes sense. Remember that the creature can move up to triple this number if it spends its whole turn moving, so if you want the PCs to be able to chase the creature, its Speed can be only so high. Creatures at higher levels need ways to deal with flying PCs, speedy PCs, and PCs with more efficient actions that let them engage and retreat more easily. This might mean adding a fly Speed, giving the creature ranged attacks, and so forth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.582,r=0.861,b=0.769), with ID ff54850b-b9d0-4b98-a404-eb817e808a24 -->

Creatures can have climb and swim Speeds even at
low levels. While you can give your creature a fly Speed
at those low levels, it‚Äôs better to wait until around 7th
level (when PCs gain access to fly) to give your creature
a fly Speed if it also has ranged attacks or another way
to harry the PCs from a distance indefinitely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.771,r=0.861,b=0.863), with ID 57cb6980-c1d4-4295-ae77-c16354400b7d -->

whatever traits you feel are appropriate. Note that these
traits might influence the damage you give the Strike.
  You might want to make sure a creature has an

Strike Attack Bonus  
Use a high attack bonus for physically combative creatures‚Äîfighter types‚Äîthat also usually have high damage. A creature could have a higher attack bonus and lower damage, or vice versa (for instance, a moderate attack bonus and extreme damage might fit a creature that‚Äôs more like a barbarian), instead of having a poor statistic in another category.

**Strike Damage**  
The Strike Damage table gives the damage a creature should deal with a single Strike. You might use a lower category if the creature has better accuracy, or a higher category if its accuracy is lower. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.858,r=0.516,b=0.942), with ID 4c2593c1-f537-474d-94c7-d0e5dc0af017 -->

A creature that‚Äôs meant to be primarily a melee threat
uses high damage for its melee Strikes, or moderate for
melee Strikes that have the agile trait. Ranged attacks
more typically use the moderate value, or even low. A
creature that‚Äôs meant to be highly damaging uses the
extreme damage values, but might then have a moderate
attack bonus. As with most statistics, extreme damage is
more likely at higher levels. You can also use the extreme
value for special attacks that the creature can use only
a limited number of times or under circumstances that
aren‚Äôt likely to happen every round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.080,r=0.906,b=0.249), with ID 07248225-5c67-4f99-8b34-4db08dccbe18 -->

More versatile creatures, such as ones that can
cast some spells and aren‚Äôt meant to primarily get
their damage through Strikes, go one category lower:
moderate for their main melee Strikes, low for agile
and ranged Strikes. Spellcasters and other creatures that
aren‚Äôt meant to be competent in a direct fight might use
the low damage value, or even less if they completely
don‚Äôt care about their Strikes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.250,r=0.904,b=0.371), with ID c56a9aa3-51f9-46c7-a6f2-3eac3ba6dbe1 -->

The Strike Damage table entries include a damage expression (a die roll or rolls plus a flat modifier) you can use as is, or you can take the damage in parentheses and build your own damage expression to hit that number. If you do the latter, remember that a d4 counts as 2.5 damage, a d6 as 3.5, a d8 as 4.5, a d10 as 5.5, and a d12 as 6.5. Usually, a damage expression works best when roughly half the damage is from dice and half is from the flat modifier. If your creature deals special damage, like 1d6 fire from _flaming_ attacks, that counts toward its total damage per Strike. Keep in mind that a creature using a weapon should have a damage value that feels right for that weapon. Extreme damage works well for two-handed weapons that use d10s or d12s for damage. On the other hand, a dagger uses only d4s, so a dagger wielder would need something like sneak attack to deal extreme damage, or you might compensate for the dagger‚Äôs lower damage per Strike by giving the creature the ability to attack more efficiently or use other tricks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.373,r=0.904,b=0.662), with ID 4698673a-b430-4363-912e-f906f6e4fcaa -->

Spells  
Your creature might have magical abilities that are best represented by spells. If you‚Äôre making a highly spellcasting-themed creature, give it prepared or spontaneous spells. For a creature that has spells due to its magical nature, especially if that magic isn‚Äôt its core focus, consider giving it some innate spells instead. How many spells you should give a creature depends on how you expect it to spend its actions in combat. If it‚Äôs primarily going to be making Strikes, it might not have any spells, or it might just have a few to help it move around better or protect against certain types of magic.

When choosing spells, lean hard into the creature‚Äôs theme. While many PCs choose spells to cover a wide <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.258,r=0.473,b=0.482), with ID 57bc5244-2da1-41fe-978d-4360757b4f96 -->

## MANUFACTURED WEAPONS
As noted in Items on page 116, most creatures have less
treasure than PCs, so those that rely on manufactured
weapons are significantly weaker if you don‚Äôt adjust
the weapons‚Äô damage to compensate. The method for
determining Strike damage on page 120 abstracts the
sources of damage, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about
adjusting the weapon‚Äôs damage. If you do decide to
calculate the weapon‚Äôs damage, give your creature
weapon specialization or greater weapon specialization
much earlier than a PC would get it. You might also
need to add sneak attack or similar abilities to make the
creature deal more damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.079,r=0.858,b=0.297), with ID c38e1a6d-0c06-4f41-a3e8-a94699a69421 -->

On the flip side, you might want to use a one-off
creature as a source of a particularly high-level piece of
treasure, such as a magic weapon. In these cases, you
might want to make the attack bonus higher for the
potency rune or the damage higher for a potent striking
rune so the PCs feel the weapon‚Äôs effect before they
obtain it. This will make the treasure feel more powerful
since they‚Äôve already been on the receiving end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.495,t=0.296,r=0.855,b=0.423), with ID 319c7210-7879-409d-a3f4-92096d51b057 -->

variety of situations, creatures are more evocative the more
focused they are. Consider selecting about three-quarters <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.447,r=0.863,b=0.483), with ID 0c8e2cce-f0c4-418b-bd7f-a7b74011be6e -->

Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is a rectangular UI element with ornate green and gold border design.
  ‚Ä¢ The number "121" is centered within a tan box, outlined in red.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is dark brown with a green upper section.
Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or units present.
  ‚Ä¢ No additional UI elements or text visible in the crop.
Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The number "121" is horizontally centered within the tan box.
  ‚Ä¢ Decorative border is at the top of the image, suggesting this is the upper portion of a larger interface.

of the spells based on relevance to the theme and the

spells aren‚Äôt all the same‚Äîselecting *fireball* for most of

When choosing spells, some won‚Äôt be very useful if cast
at an extremely low rank compared to the creature‚Äôs level.
Most notably, damaging spells drop off in usefulness for
a creature that‚Äôs expected to last only a single fight. A
damaging spell 2 ranks below the highest rank a creature
of that level can cast is still potentially useful, but beyond
that, don‚Äôt bother. Spells that have the incapacitation trait
should be in the highest spell slot if you want the creature
to potentially get their full effect against PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.158,r=0.515,b=0.297), with ID 08f9414a-aeb4-4e4a-8d81-31d374907960 -->

## Spell DC and Spell Attack Modifier
Set the creature‚Äôs spell DC and spell attack modifier using the Spell DC and Spell Attack Modifier table on page 121. Most creatures use the same DC for all their spells, even if they have multiple types, such as a creature with both prepared spells and innate spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.305,r=0.513,b=0.402), with ID 8fe8ba9a-19a0-4605-9455-00c71c075496 -->

Use the high numbers for primary casters, and
the moderate numbers for creatures that have some
supplemental spells but are focused more on combat.
At 15th level and higher, the extreme numbers be¬≠
come standard for spellcasters. A few creatures might use the
extreme numbers at lower levels, but they tend to be
highly specialized, with very weak defenses and Strikes.
Secondary spellcasters can go up to high numbers if
they‚Äôre above 15th level and have offensive spells. There
is no low value‚Äîthe creature shouldn‚Äôt have any spells
in the first place if it would be that bad at using them! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.403,r=0.513,b=0.572), with ID 237c9b07-7271-4011-a5bc-b597fd986814 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration depicting an anthropomorphic red panda-like creature dressed in adventurer's attire, holding a staff and carrying a satchel with herbs and a potion bottle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is a humanoid red panda creature with reddish-brown and white fur, pointed ears, and a bushy striped tail.
  ‚Ä¢ The character wears a white shirt, brown vest, blue-green pants, and a red scarf.
  ‚Ä¢ Accessories include a satchel slung over the shoulder, containing visible herbs and a corked potion bottle.
  ‚Ä¢ The character holds a staff with a carved, ornate head in its right hand.
  ‚Ä¢ The pose is dynamic, with one foot forward and the tail arched behind, suggesting readiness or alertness.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is plain white, focusing attention on the character.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting is even, with soft shadows and highlights accentuating the fur and clothing textures.
  ‚Ä¢ Colour palette is dominated by earthy tones: browns, reds, greens, and off-whites.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The character is centered, occupying most of the frame.
  ‚Ä¢ The staff is held diagonally across the body, and the satchel rests at the character‚Äôs left hip.
  ‚Ä¢ The tail curves to the right, balancing the composition.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration conveys a sense of adventure and preparedness, with visual cues (staff, potion, herbs) suggesting a magical or alchemical role.
  ‚Ä¢ The anthropomorphic design and detailed attire indicate a fantasy setting, likely for a game or narrative context.
  ‚Ä¢ The character‚Äôs alert posture and expressive face enhance its personality and narrative potential. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.575,r=0.525,b=0.959), with ID a5f3aaff-8c13-4279-907c-a548219551d2 -->

## Prepared and Spontaneous Spells
Spell slots work best for creatures that are meant to play like PC spellcasters. Choose the magical tradition best suited to the creature. You aren‚Äôt strictly limited to that tradition‚Äôs spell list, though sticking close to it will make your creature‚Äôs connection to that tradition more clear. The decision to use prepared or spontaneous spellcasting should align with the creature‚Äôs theme: a spontaneous spellcaster fits well as a one-off creature, since spontaneous spellcasting grants greater flexibility in the middle of battle, while a prepared spellcaster makes for a great recurring character who can change their spells between appearances. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.280), with ID 8f59b93b-368e-454f-a976-05ca9d14a44a -->

For a creature that can cast as many spells as a PC
spellcaster, the highest spell rank the creature can cast
is half its level rounded up. It gets five cantrips. If the
creature‚Äôs level is odd, it gets two spell slots of the
highest spell rank (plus three spell slots of each lower
rank), or three spell slots of that rank (plus four spell
slots of each lower level). If its level is even, it gets three
spell slots of the highest spell rank (plus three spell slots
of each lower rank), or four spell slots of that rank (plus
four spell slots of each lower rank). You can base the
number of spells on the class you are trying to emulate
or choose more spells if the creature doesn‚Äôt have many
other abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.281,r=0.904,b=0.478), with ID a2d7feaa-4824-4996-9c8e-985c8ed9f0ab -->

Because creatures tend to be ‚Äúon stage‚Äù for only a short time, you usually don‚Äôt need to fill every spell slot. You can often fill just the top three ranks of spells, pick cantrips, and slot in a few thematic backup spells in the fourth rank down. For a recurring foe, you might give it a full complement of spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.480,r=0.903,b=0.571), with ID b30a179e-811d-4478-aa70-149d3a5ef46a -->

## Innate Spells
Unlike prepared and spontaneous spells, innate spells can
be of higher rank than half the creature‚Äôs level rounded
up, and you can choose how often they‚Äôre used‚Äîthey
can even be used at will or be constant effects. The most
notable innate spells tend to be top-rank ones that make
a big impact but can be used only once, at-will spells that
strongly reinforce the creature‚Äôs theme, and constant
spells that give it an ongoing benefit. A spell that‚Äôs
usable a limited number of times and has a lower
rank than the creature‚Äôs highest rank is typically less
likely to come up in combat; however, that‚Äôs a great
spot for utility and recovery spells, such as *dispel
magic* or *sound body*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.583,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID b37d244e-bf10-4d43-8fc9-6348d191fc5d -->

Sometimes a strongly thematic innate spell is of
a higher rank than the creature would normally be
able to cast, but it‚Äôs so fitting that it belongs there. Be
careful when doing this, as PCs might not have access
to the appropriate countermeasures for the spell.
This option works best for support, action denial, or
battlefield control spells that change the odds of a fight
without outright killing anyone, such as the succubus‚Äôs
*dominate* spell. These should make the fight more <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.802,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 066393d1-eecc-4f97-8dcc-48909c51698b -->

very low, typically just one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.111), with ID 53ae6454-5677-4174-a014-76d49a728b9e -->

Though you can achieve all sorts of things with innate
spells, always start with the theme and an idea of how
you want the creature to spend its actions. And though
you could give the creature a tool to counter every kind
of PC attack or trick, remember that the players chose
those options to enjoy using them, rather than to be
constantly foiled by an effectively invincible creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.112,r=0.474,b=0.221), with ID fd0051b1-bc26-4bf6-b34a-8984296792b2 -->

Rituals
Since rituals happen during downtime, giving them to a creature is usually a purely thematic choice. You can skip even looking at rituals in most cases. If you decide a creature needs to have a ritual for your story, add in the ritual whenever you need it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.229,r=0.474,b=0.328), with ID 94dccf65-c7d6-4ef2-8aa3-16ec7da96e15 -->

## DESIGN ABILITIES
In this step, you‚Äôll take the ideas for abilities you noted when you developed your concept and design these abilities for your creature. You can look at existing creature abilities from *Monster Core* and feats from *Player Core* and use them as is or modify them to fit your needs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.335,r=0.474,b=0.433), with ID 566255fe-e499-403f-b50f-18fc22853eaa -->

When choosing abilities, think about both the number
of abilities and the diversity of abilities. Having a large
number of similar abilities can make the creature tougher
to run, and it probably can‚Äôt use them all anyway. A
diversity of abilities gives the creature different ways to
act in different situations, and helps guide you as the
GM. For instance, a combat creature might have one
ability it uses to get into position, another to use when
it wants to focus damage on a single enemy, and a third
that‚Äôs more defensive. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.433,r=0.474,b=0.588), with ID 94ea7fad-1c5f-46f3-9458-0143fc17534d -->

## Basics of Ability Design
There are a few principles of ability construction that you‚Äôll want to keep in mind. Some guidance for specific types of abilities will come later, but these apply to everything.

- ‚Ä¢ Respect the action economy.
- ‚Ä¢ Make sure abilities are level appropriate.
- ‚Ä¢ Avoid ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.596,r=0.474,b=0.727), with ID 90fae0c5-10a3-4c9b-b4f0-2b47f667ced4 -->

Action Economy  
Understanding a creature‚Äôs action economy is key to making it work in play. Remember how short the lifespan of a typical combat creature is. Including a bunch of combat abilities might mean you spend time building actions the creature will never have time to use. Narrow your selections down to the smallest and most compelling set that makes sense. Also keep in mind that special actions will compete for time with any combat spells you give the creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.736,r=0.474,b=0.894), with ID 7ddaaada-1836-48f0-aa34-8658401be415 -->

Reactions can help, giving the creature a way to act
when it‚Äôs not its turn. See Reactive Abilities on page 125
for advice on designing these tricky abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.893,r=0.474,b=0.941), with ID bfc40678-1524-4f47-96db-b0c329520edb -->

## FOCUS SPELLS

Some creatures have focus spells, especially when those focus spells clearly fit a creature‚Äôs theme. Simply give the creature the focus spells you like and between 1 and 3 Focus Points (you can also allow your creature to cast focus spells using spell slots). Use the same DC and spell attack modifier as any other spell. A creature that has just 1 Focus Point is likely to cast a focus spell only once, unless it‚Äôs a recurring enemy. If the creature has plenty of spells already, you might want to skip focus spells altogether, as they aren‚Äôt as strong as top-rank spell slots. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.072,r=0.863,b=0.283), with ID dcd122cd-aad3-4eed-b14e-76ec7ecd6983 -->

Because of PC capabilities at higher levels, creatures
at those levels should get more abilities that improve
their action economy. For instance, creatures that
grapple should have Improved Grab instead of Grab,
Speeds should be higher, and many abilities that would
have cost an action at a lower level should be free
actions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.292,r=0.865,b=0.404), with ID e3d391f4-0545-43d8-be12-7764ef9f86a7 -->

Level Appropriateness  
The effects of an ability should be appropriate to the creature‚Äôs level. For damaging abilities, that means they follow the damage guidelines on page 124. For others, take a look at spells and feats with a similar effect to see if they‚Äôre level appropriate. For instance, say you‚Äôre considering giving a 6th-level creature the ability to teleport a short distance. Translocate is comparable‚Äî that‚Äôs a 4th-rank spell, normally cast by a 7th-level or higher creature. That means 6th level probably isn‚Äôt too low, but the creature shouldn‚Äôt be able to use the ability more than once. You can also compare your creature to those in a Monster Core volume to see if the special abilities seem similar in power to those of other creatures of the same level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.414,r=0.865,b=0.650), with ID d5eba824-c55e-4906-94b5-5fbd1691eb2e -->

Invisible Abilities  
Avoid abilities that do nothing but change the creature‚Äôs math, also known as ‚Äúinvisible abilities.‚Äù These alter a creature‚Äôs statistics in a way that‚Äôs invisible to the players, which makes the creature less engaging because the players don‚Äôt see it using its abilities in a tangible or evocative way. For example, an ability that allows a creature to use an action to increase its accuracy for the round with no outward sign (or worse, just grants a passive bonus to its accuracy) isn‚Äôt that compelling, whereas one that increases its damage by lighting its arrows on fire is noticeable. These both work toward the same goal‚Äîdealing more damage this round‚Äîbut one is far more memorable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.658,r=0.865,b=0.880), with ID a5fecc32-780e-4511-8d39-b4d07b89f436 -->

**Active Abilities**  
Abilities a creature uses on its turn have the most flexibility and scope. You can use the Spell DC and Spell <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.887,r=0.864,b=0.943), with ID ff200e63-beb3-4c30-9b1a-36ff11b84572 -->

Attack Modifier table on page 121 to determine active
ability DCs as well as spell DCs. You can have an ability
use 1 to 3 actions as needed (or be a free action in rare
cases) and use just about any type of tactic. Feats, spells,
and existing creature abilities provide a wide variety of
examples, so look for something similar to your idea to
use as a basis. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.079,r=0.516,b=0.187), with ID 769a6454-a5c9-484a-9be8-1d4f578c87b2 -->

Consider how you want your creature to spend
its turns. Two-action activities pretty much define
the creature‚Äôs turn, and single actions work best for
supplemental benefits or normal Strikes. As you build
out your idea of a creature‚Äôs turn, don‚Äôt forget about
movement! A creature often needs to spend actions
getting into position, especially early in a fight. This
is especially challenging with melee-only creatures.
You can give such creatures abilities similar to Sudden
Charge or the deadly mantis‚Äôs Leaping Grab. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.189,r=0.514,b=0.341), with ID 9230d308-3206-4483-8577-655e00b0a952 -->

Use 3-action abilities sparingly, as a creature can‚Äôt
use them if it is slowed or stunned‚Äîmaking a creature‚Äôs
coolest or most defining ability use up 3 actions might
mean the creature never gets to use it. These activities
should be reserved for abilities that include some
movement (like Trample) or that the creature is likely
to use before engaging in combat. Don‚Äôt make an ability
use 3 actions as a way to balance it‚Äîsaying ‚ÄúThis can
be more powerful than other abilities because it is less
likely to work,‚Äù is a recipe for frustration if you‚Äôve made
a cool ability that‚Äôs too hard or even impossible for the
creature to use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.342,r=0.514,b=0.524), with ID 253dd8a0-7645-45d2-bf7e-46d721e84ef1 -->

Be especially careful with activities when designing
boss creatures. They‚Äôre likely to get targeted with the
PCs‚Äô most powerful detrimental effects, get grabbed,
become slowed, or otherwise have their actions
restricted. Bosses need to have solid options they can use
with 1 or 2 actions. This lets them use their remaining
actions to get away, use a simple ability, or otherwise
keep the fight dynamic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.526,r=0.513,b=0.648), with ID 97bf759f-1862-47fa-960c-6fb23bab9bdb -->

Free Actions  
Use free actions that don‚Äôt have triggers sparingly, and when you do, they should almost always be used for support or utility actions, not Strikes or movement. If you come up with a free action, consider whether it should be its own action or part of a combo, such as drawing a weapon and attacking. In cases like the latter, you might be better off making a single action that allows the creature to draw a weapon and then Strike. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.660,r=0.513,b=0.801), with ID dd34f4fd-b8bb-4e94-a132-364fd8f75ad2 -->

Damage-Dealing Abilities  
If a special action is a single action with only one target, you can often set damage using the Strike Damage table on page 120. If it uses more than 1 action or requires setup in some way, it might deal higher damage than is typical; often, you can just use the extreme column in these cases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.814,r=0.513,b=0.922), with ID da4a6e75-7763-4e93-af5f-c20545dc27ec -->

For abilities that deal damage in an area, use the Area <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.154,t=0.924,r=0.512,b=0.939), with ID d768ec9b-333b-4566-9462-f9288e6df9c5 -->

Damage table. These numbers are based on a 2-action activity (e.g., most damaging spells). Single actions should deal much less damage. An ability that has another significant effect, like applying a condition, should deal less damage; for this, look at the damage for 2 or more levels lower, and judge which value would best match based on the severity of the additional effect. These abilities typically allow a basic saving throw. The table includes values for unlimited-use abilities (ones that can be used at will) and limited-use ones (which can be used once or, like dragon breath abilities, once or twice but not on consecutive turns). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.264), with ID d27afa39-2b91-494f-be8c-27969dc32968 -->

You can use the dice given or generate your own
expression based on the damage in parentheses, as
detailed in the Strike Damage section on page 120. If
a high-level effect has a small area compared to similar
abilities, you could have it deal more damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.266,r=0.904,b=0.341), with ID a3e1d3f5-8bae-4447-b80a-165ca0633f1f -->

## Defensive Abilities
Active offensive abilities usually fit creatures better
than defensive abilities do. Save defense increases for
creatures that are strongly defense-themed. For martial
creatures, something as simple as a shield and Shield
Block is usually plenty. Defensive abilities often run the
risk of being invisible abilities. For examples of good
defensive abilities, look at spells like _sanctuary_ for ideas,
or other spells that create interesting protective effects <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.797,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 853885b3-50ee-4d25-8cd6-d0b80e7446e1 -->

BUILDING GAMES <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.689,t=0.018,r=0.870,b=0.043), with ID 889dd044-9f87-4189-9cd3-634b1fcd0dae -->

instead of just granting a bonus. If you do want to make
a creature defensive, pick one defensive ability rather
than several, since stacking up multiple defenses can
make for a frustrating fight. One solid style of defensive
ability is a mode switch, which causes the creature to get
stronger defenses, but limits its attacks, spells, or other
offensive options. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.189), with ID f0c08c74-1432-4a12-b412-2d01c60f88a6 -->

Reactive Abilities  
Reactions and free actions with triggers can give a creature an impact outside of its turn. This can make the fight more interesting, but it may also be risky. It‚Äôs tempting to give every creature a reaction, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a good idea. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.198,r=0.472,b=0.295), with ID cbe0d375-c66e-412b-870d-dbec2418363e -->

To decide whether your creature should have a
reaction, first consider if the creature has the reflexes or
insight to react well in the first place‚Äîfor instance, an
ogre doesn‚Äôt have Reactive Strike because it‚Äôs a big oaf.
Oozes, constructs, and unintelligent creatures are less
likely to have reactions than others for this reason. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.296,r=0.471,b=0.387), with ID 6e0beea4-0b66-45d0-adbf-e9b05e4f3f23 -->

Second, look at the complexity of the encounter your
creature is likely to appear in. If you have a large number
of creatures, skipping reactions can make the fight flow
faster. A creature that‚Äôs more likely to fight solo, on the
other hand, might have a reaction to give it a way to
continue to be dangerous amid an onslaught of attacks
by the party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.388,r=0.471,b=0.494), with ID ff071ad6-c751-4dc1-a3fb-e0e6c94da457 -->

When creating reactions, be careful with ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù
abilities‚Äîones that punish players for making perfectly
reasonable choices, for rolling poorly, and so on. If you
include abilities like this, they need to reinforce the
creature‚Äôs core theme and the play style you want it
to use in combat. For example, a creature that Strikes
as a reaction when someone fails an attack roll will
encourage PCs to use their actions on other tactics,
rather than attacking multiple times each turn. Is that
what you want? Is this dynamic essential for making the
creature feel like it‚Äôs supposed to? This isn‚Äôt the type of
ability you‚Äôd give to any old creature‚Äîonly an incredible
duelist or something similar. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.495,r=0.470,b=0.693), with ID cd7111f1-e3e7-4274-bdae-60bd937bc6df -->

Reactions should require something out of the ordinary to happen, or should be relatively weak if triggered by something ordinary. A reaction that triggers anytime someone tries to Strike a creature is likely to be perceived by the players as uninteresting because it‚Äôs so predictable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.693,r=0.471,b=0.785), with ID 5eae0c0d-6e6c-4378-878f-eca197fd6f83 -->

The best reactions should be telegraphed so when they happen, it makes sense to the players. Think of one of the core reactions of the game: Shield Block. The creature raises its shield‚Äîan obvious action the PCs can see‚Äîso when it blocks damage from an attack, that makes perfect sense. Similarly, if you made a crystalline creature, you might have it build up sonic energy in a low thrum, so when it uses a reaction to release a burst of sonic energy when hit, the players can say, ‚ÄúOh, I should have seen that coming.‚Äù <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.786,r=0.471,b=0.938), with ID b4849429-b7c4-4183-bb93-155d3069f754 -->

Reaction Damage  
Reactions should use lower damage, usually that of a moderate Strike. A reaction that deals area damage might deal low damage, though use such reactions with caution. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.077,r=0.861,b=0.144), with ID 985cc964-2291-4b99-b323-292571e68409 -->

## Constant and Automatic Abilities
Certain abilities shouldn‚Äôt use any actions. Auras are a common constant ability, with frightful presence, the cinder rat‚Äôs fetid fumes, and the xulgath‚Äôs stench as notable examples. An aura needs a range, and if it needs a DC, you‚Äôll usually set it to the moderate spell DC unless the aura is one of the creature‚Äôs defining concepts. For example, the xulgath‚Äôs stench DC is significantly higher because the aura is such an iconic part of the creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.153,r=0.861,b=0.310), with ID ea85c752-9765-43df-a47a-de44aadd476c -->

Abilities the creature has no control over should be
automatic. For example, the living wildfire fire elemental
explodes into flames when it dies. It has no option not
to, so this wouldn‚Äôt make sense as a reaction or free
action. Conversely, the Ferocity ability is a reaction
because it requires the creature to give itself a last push
to stay at 1 HP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.311,r=0.861,b=0.417), with ID 6d09bb6a-4880-4276-9f66-c70feab2c55b -->

## Constant and Automatic Damage
Much like for reactions, damage for a constant ability should be pretty low. Usually, this value is just below low Strike damage. Automatic abilities, like the living wildfire‚Äôs explosion ability, tend to deal moderate Strike damage or unlimited-use area damage. These abilities can deal even more if they happen only after the creature is dead or otherwise no longer presents a threat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.430,r=0.862,b=0.557), with ID 58fe2ec0-ec4e-4d5c-9b0d-afbc3cb92e05 -->

Skill Abilities  
A skilled creature might have abilities related to its skills. The skill feats in *Player Core* make for a good baseline. Avoid giving your creature skill abilities that won‚Äôt matter in its interactions with PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.566,r=0.861,b=0.648), with ID 257e1086-f23f-4c9f-8df0-e4b4a3824e99 -->

Review
Now it‚Äôs time to look over your completed creature as a whole and make sure it‚Äôs living up to your concept. Can it do everything you wanted? Does it fit its intended role? Is there anything you could add or anything superfluous you could cut to get the creature where it needs to be? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.659,r=0.860,b=0.769), with ID aa0a181d-4480-4bcf-b203-57abd169b55d -->

If this creature is built for combat, run through a
few turns in your head. Does it still work decently if it
gets slowed? Can it move into combat against the PCs
effectively considering their mobility options compared
to its own? Does it have any abilities it‚Äôll never use
because of its other actions? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.771,r=0.860,b=0.861), with ID f8941ffd-7cec-4d83-b086-3828e20e43d9 -->

When you‚Äôre satisfied with your creation, it‚Äôs ready to
hit the table. But that‚Äôs not necessarily the end! If you
notice issues during the game, you can fix them on the
spot. It‚Äôs your game, and you can freely change what you

Summary : This image shows a stylized user interface element with the number "127" prominently displayed, likely representing a score, resource, or count in a game or application.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is the number "127" in large, bold, red-outlined font on a tan rectangular background.
  ‚Ä¢ Above the number is a decorative green and gold motif with symmetrical curves and a central diamond shape.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is dark brown and green, suggesting a fantasy or medieval theme.
Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or units are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The number "127" is centered within a bordered rectangle.
  ‚Ä¢ No other UI elements or text are visible in the crop.
Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The number "127" is at the bottom center of the image.
  ‚Ä¢ The decorative motif is positioned above the number, occupying the upper half of the crop.
Analysis :

  ‚Ä¢ The ornate design and color palette reinforce a thematic or immersive setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.900,t=0.924,r=0.999,b=0.982), with ID b15f7980-48d0-4320-a33a-e10763575c3a -->

PATHFINDER GM CORE <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.015,r=0.377,b=0.042), with ID 995335f8-aeee-4150-bc8e-666d5a65ac23 -->

## BUILDING NPCS
Creatures that are meant to cleave closely to character classes or intended to represent people rather than monsters are NPCs. They might face more scrutiny around their mechanics than creatures because a player can more directly compare their rogue to an NPC who acts like a rogue. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to build an NPC exactly like a PC, though. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.203), with ID 3717ebf2-5e0a-41b0-b818-8ea698b9fea5 -->

You can build NPCs just like you would any other
creature. If an NPC should work like they have a class,
use the class features and feats of a suitable class to
pick abilities, and look at both the class‚Äôs proficiencies
and attribute modifiers to determine how strong the
NPC‚Äôs statistics should be. Class Road Maps on page
129 has prebuilt road maps for *Player Core* and *Player
Core 2* classes to get you started. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.204,r=0.515,b=0.326), with ID bde27e7c-522c-4e27-aa2c-3f0ddad0e17e -->

If the NPC isn‚Äôt meant to work like they have a class (a baker, for example), instead build the character separately. You can create new abilities as needed to get the NPC‚Äôs interactions with the PCs to express their theme and role in the story. These NPCs can be level ‚Äì1 or level 0. Their capabilities are below those of PCs, and they should typically not use any class features or feats from PC classes. Creatures of these levels tend to be extremely simple. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.326,r=0.515,b=0.463), with ID 76ce88cf-1e94-4bd4-9542-85a7a7068291 -->

It‚Äôs highly recommended that you select NPC skills
using proficiency ranks as you would a PC, though
you don‚Äôt need to be precise about the number of skill
increases you give the NPC. You can give them earlier
access to expert, master, or legendary proficiency if
they‚Äôre a skill-based NPC and better proficiency in
narrow areas of expertise, like Engineering Lore for a
tinker NPC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.464,r=0.514,b=0.586), with ID 8b1a8631-e3af-4f1f-a59d-86794e06915b -->

Non-Combat Level  
An NPC‚Äôs level should represent their combat prowess. A common person might not be a combat threat, even if they‚Äôre important or highly skilled, and they consequently have a low level. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt present a challenge in other types of encounters. This is represented by a non-combat level (page 31) and tends to be specific to their area of expertise. For example, a barrister might be level ‚Äì1 in combat but a 4th-level creature in an encounter related to legal matters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.598,r=0.513,b=0.769), with ID 22413925-6311-4ff8-a6f9-2540a423ff88 -->

This can go the other way as well, such as with a
powerful combat creature that‚Äôs not suited to social
settings. This is usually the case with creatures untrained
in mental skills. You can improvise this as you run the
game, or you can plan ahead if you have something
particular in mind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.771,r=0.513,b=0.862), with ID a6ea68be-0aff-4cbd-93dc-ddbb11579f5b -->

Building an NPC‚Äôs non-combat level is relatively
simple. Choose the level you want the NPC to be for the
type of non-combat challenge you have in mind and use
the skill numbers for that level‚Äîtypically high or even
extreme. Some challenges, such as social challenges, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.863,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID f3ca936e-9fb9-45aa-8329-feb1ce19a518 -->

require the creature to have a high Perception and Will,
so in those cases, you should increase those values as
well. These should be set at the moderate or high values
for the non-combat level, usually, depending on how
adept you want the NPC to be. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.159), with ID c30d8e95-02b5-4fb9-9996-f21996d47f15 -->

Non-Combat XP  
The Experience Points gained for besting an NPC depend on how the party overcame them, because XP comes from overcoming a specific challenge. If the PCs defeat the NPC in a non-combat setting of the NPC‚Äôs specialty, the party gets XP based on the NPC‚Äôs non-combat level. If they just beat the NPC up, the XP would be based on the NPC‚Äôs creature level. Quite often, that means 0 XP and failure at the PCs‚Äô objective; for instance, during a baking contest, if the PCs murder the other baker, not only would they be disqualified, but they would likely be charged with a crime. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.169,r=0.905,b=0.357), with ID 547aec2e-6f40-410d-9bb1-a71341f04c89 -->

PC-style Build  
If you do choose to build an NPC fully using the PC rules, your NPC should generally end up being an appropriate challenge as a creature of their level. They will likely have lower statistics in some areas than if you had built them using the creature rules but more options due to their full complement of feats and class features. This is best saved for important, recurring NPCs, especially if they‚Äôre meant to engage in social or exploration endeavors rather than just battles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.368,r=0.905,b=0.525), with ID a8fc81f2-c1a0-4598-9eb7-37c4ebafb9db -->

There are still some considerations and shortcuts that
can expedite the process while ensuring the NPC works
as intended. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.526,r=0.904,b=0.570), with ID ec05317f-c458-41a2-850f-7c56c0eb05ec -->

The creature‚Äôs treasure should follow the Treasure for New Characters rules on page 61. You‚Äôll need to account for this in your campaign‚Äôs overall treasure. You might even want to give the NPC a higher-level item appropriate as a treasure allotment for the level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.542,t=0.571,r=0.904,b=0.662), with ID 30a63bd7-cca5-48b8-a9cf-ed8af7b1cd11 -->

You can expedite attribute modifier generation by making the starting attribute modifiers add up to +9, with no more than one modifier at +4 (and typically no more than one negative modifier). You can skip adding a background if you do this, but you might want to give the creature two skills, which includes one Lore skill, to represent the skills granted by a background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.663,r=0.904,b=0.786), with ID 4ecb2bbb-ce56-40de-8ca5-3156702bc7c8 -->

CLASS ROAD MAPS  
You can use these suggestions when creating your road map to emulate a PC class, customizing as you see fit. You‚Äôll still need to look through the class to pick feats, weapons, and the like. Any statistic that isn‚Äôt specifically listed can use moderate numbers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.089,r=0.460,b=0.188), with ID b2a3f4d3-97ef-4998-883a-582659417e1d -->

You don't need to give an NPC all the abilities from
its class‚Äîespecially those that just alter numbers. Each
class's entry lists several abilities that are good quick
choices and make for more interesting encounters.

# BUILDING ITEMS

*Creating your own magic and alchemical items is an amazing way to customize the adventure and gameplay for your group and add unique elements without requiring quite the same mechanical depth as a whole new class, archetype, or ancestry.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.079,r=0.908,b=0.167), with ID 9515216a-b529-4f2e-a282-d313287a4692 -->

New items make great mementos of previous adventures  
and tend to be one of the easiest elements for a character to  
begin using mid-campaign after receiving them as a reward.  
This section explains the philosophy and numbers behind  
creating items so you can design your own in no time! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.203,r=0.514,b=0.281), with ID 0563cbbe-cdab-4f13-afb7-815b25fee1e1 -->

## CONCEPT AND ROLE
First, come up with a concept for the item based on the role the item serves in your game and in the game‚Äôs world. You might include a new item in an ancient ruin to hint at its history and characterize the people who used to live there. For instance, a Thassilonian ruin might have an item based on rune magic, while a Jistkan ruin might have an item related to the empire‚Äôs ancient constructs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.290,r=0.514,b=0.418), with ID 4911c9f9-3faa-487e-8d9f-aa5478c71963 -->

A new magic item might be important later in the story,
or its role might be as simple as a fun wolf-themed item for
the monk that uses Wolf Stance. Keep your concept in mind
to guide you through the process. Start thinking about what
kind of magic item it will be. Each item type has its own
niche, and some are less likely to be as useful to the PCs. For
instance, new weapons and armor require the PC to give up
the weapon or armor they already have, which might make
them more reluctant to use the new items unless they‚Äôre
noticeably better, while consumable items don‚Äôt have as big
an impact on the story as permanent items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.419,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID 92b974e9-1bd7-4733-9621-37498b0b6948 -->

Item Level  
A new item is typically going to be within a few levels of the PCs. If it‚Äôs too low, it might not be interesting, and if it‚Äôs too high, it might be too powerful or too lucrative to sell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.598,r=0.514,b=0.665), with ID 94f49f29-86aa-41fe-ad67-57f5be236bcb -->

Comparison
First, look at similar items. For example, if you want a permanent item that lets someone fly, look at the *flying broomstick*, which moves of its own volition to a location and thus can‚Äôt be used to gain a huge advantage in combat, and *winged sandals*, which can. This will give you an idea of the right level range and the specifics and limitations of existing items. You might even be able to just adjust one of those to get what you want with minimal work. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.675,r=0.513,b=0.817), with ID d65d6c14-1a75-4ba8-8ae7-109485e6e428 -->

Item Effects  
Next, use the item‚Äôs concept and role to decide its effects.  
This is where your creativity will bring the item to life.  
Make sure to have it do something exciting and roleplay-  
inspiring. A magic item that does nothing more than  
deliver a bonus is far less interesting, even if the item does  
have a load-bearing item bonus, like a magic weapon. To <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.828,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 88ce8114-6b01-4fb0-aebb-defc00f4b930 -->

determine the item‚Äôs power, take into account the special
abilities you give the item as well as the item bonus (if any)
that it grants. For specific advice for the type of magic item
you are creating, check out Designing by Type on page 131. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.203,r=0.904,b=0.266), with ID c0c8fa36-9415-439b-b4fe-f5703c867db6 -->

Special Abilities  
When deciding what special abilities are appropriate for what level, it‚Äôs best to look for similar spells to gauge the effect. For most consumables, the effect should be less powerful than the highest rank spell a spellcaster of the item‚Äôs level could cast. Scrolls are about the most efficient you can get‚Äîthey‚Äôre the same level the spellcaster would be‚Äîbut they require a spellcaster that has the spell on their list, and take the same actions as casting the spell normally. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.277,r=0.903,b=0.417), with ID 827790f4-dc7a-427b-b94c-23cb6fe020a3 -->

The most straightforward choice is a once-per-day
ability. For this, the item‚Äôs level should be at least 2 levels
higher than the minimum level a spellcaster could first cast
that spell. For example, if your ability is about as powerful
as a 3rd-rank spell cast once per day (perhaps haste),
then it should be at least a 7th-level item. A basic wand
is a good example. However, a wand is flexible and can
contain the most effective possible choice for its spell rank
(such as long-lasting spells where once a day is effectively
permanent), so a specific item that doesn‚Äôt grant such a
spell could have additional powers or bonuses at the same
price as a wand. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.418,r=0.903,b=0.601), with ID 793e9ef8-3a54-46ce-8b55-920951ed253b -->

If the item can be activated multiple times per day, it
should be at least 4 levels higher instead‚Äî9th level in our
example. Frequency could range from twice per day to
once per hour and anything in between. Choose whatever
makes sense to allow the characters to use the item more
frequently without being effectively constant or unlimited.
The appropriate frequency, or whether it‚Äôs ever okay to
have unlimited activations, varies wildly based on the spell.
Unlimited castings of a cantrip is fine, but an effect akin to
a non-cantrip spell is rarely a good idea. Only attempt to
build such an item when you‚Äôre certain of the consequences. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.604,r=0.902,b=0.769), with ID 307f7aa8-1d98-4644-8c0d-cc934a0d6eca -->

Items that can be activated less often than once per
day don‚Äôt appear too often, and they usually fit best with
abilities that make sense outside of encounters. It‚Äôs still
best to stick to the guidelines for once-per-day abilities,
but these items tend to have more properties‚Äîand often
strange ones. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.771,r=0.903,b=0.862), with ID 82a62c13-bdcd-4146-97d6-bb6573a5bdfd -->

Constant Abilities  
If you want an effect to be constant, set the level and Price accordingly. For instance, let‚Äôs say your group is 16th level and you want to give them an item themed around flying. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.876,r=0.902,b=0.939), with ID 3e9f6ff9-1521-4cef-8181-6c413eefa1c1 -->

130 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.960,r=0.083,b=0.982), with ID ba9ce548-af14-4a88-95d7-37b3b948d32c -->

A 7th-rank *fly* spell lasts an hour already, so one casting
covers a significant portion of the adventuring day. To keep
it simpler, you decide to create a 16th-level cloak that lets
the wearer constantly fly. Remember, some effects were
never meant to be constant and could warp your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.078,r=0.471,b=0.160), with ID 3895733b-d547-4b72-908f-2d8368a73574 -->

Activation Actions
Watch out when picking the number of actions an activation takes! A 1-action activation that casts a spell with a 2-action casting time is drastically more powerful in an encounter than an item with a 2-action activation would be. An item like that is typically much higher level, and it works best with ‚Äúhelper‚Äù spells or ones with limited utility rather than offensive spells. The safest bet is to use the same number of actions the spell normally takes to cast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.169,r=0.471,b=0.312), with ID 105f803a-2749-403b-aa20-82159e014187 -->

Scaling out of Usefulness  
Some spells aren‚Äôt appealing if their rank is too low. For instance, an item that casts 1st-rank *breathe fire* three times per day might be 5th or 6th level. The problem is that spell scaling has the biggest impact at low levels, so the spell isn‚Äôt effective compared to other actions a character could take. Err on the side of fewer, more impressive activations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.323,r=0.471,b=0.435), with ID 361b1901-f07d-4121-82f2-1aaf3fa26dd4 -->

Bonuses
If your item includes item bonuses, check the table below for the minimum item levels the game‚Äôs math expects permanent bonuses to be applied to. A lower-level item might give such a bonus temporarily, but keep track to make sure the item isn‚Äôt effectively permanent. If a character typically picks three or fewer locks a day, there‚Äôs no difference between a +2 item bonus to pick all locks and an activation that gives a +2 item bonus to Pick a Lock three times per day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.445,r=0.470,b=0.601), with ID 1b36330b-d986-4e0e-9af5-0a58cec099f5 -->

For attack bonuses, AC, and saves, the minimums match _runic weapon_ and _magic armor_. You can have other items with these bonuses (like _handwraps of mighty blows_), but keep in mind they compete with fundamental runes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.603,r=0.470,b=0.663), with ID d144eb72-29cf-4758-bcd6-49edd234ca64 -->

Skill bonuses come on a wider range of items. Some are
more broadly useful, so an Athletics item might be more
expensive than an equivalent Society item. Gaining a bonus
to Perception is especially valuable compared to gaining a
bonus to a skill. Just because an item is the minimum level
for its bonus doesn‚Äôt mean the bonus should be the item‚Äôs
only power. The item can and should have an additional
interesting power beyond the bonus. Likewise, an item can
come at a higher level than the minimum, but if it‚Äôs much
higher, its abilities start to compete with the next bonus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.664,r=0.470,b=0.817), with ID aecacf81-95ca-42d2-8475-355809143b84 -->

**DESIGNING BY TYPE**  
The following guidance applies to items of various types. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.077,r=0.859,b=0.113), with ID 65f5eb28-7a5f-43f6-9ada-a2201c0f01a0 -->

Alchemical Items  
Alchemical items are consumables. Because alchemists can make a large number for free, alchemical items tend to be on the weaker end for their level, with lower Prices. Avoid alchemical effects that feel too much like magic. Alchemy is capable of fantastical things, but should have its own distinct feel; where you draw the line depends on your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.123,r=0.860,b=0.249), with ID 209c8e2c-1cf1-4467-a386-5ec424160151 -->

Alchemical bombs are like weapons for alchemists
and should primarily deal damage, with small extra
effects. Existing bombs are great models. Elixirs are
varied; make sure not to duplicate potions, especially
highly magical ones. Poisons are one of the trickier
alchemical items to make, and it‚Äôs usually best to just
tweak one found on pages 248‚Äì250 to avoid making
something that‚Äôs overpowered; compare to poisons of
the same type that have similar onset and stage duration,
as longer onset and duration poisons tend to deal
drastically more damage. Alchemical tools are best used
for adding a little weirdness. They can be creative and
interesting, but tend not to be powerful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.250,r=0.861,b=0.448), with ID 30c401af-38e2-439a-b8f4-bea214e8b107 -->

Ammunition
Magic ammunition is consumable; launching it destroys it. Pay attention to whether you give the ammunition an activation: any big flashy effect for its level should almost always have one, since otherwise the effect is essentially a free action on top of a Strike. This is particularly important for extremely low-level ammunition, since a high-level character could use that ammunition for every Strike without noticing the gold cost. If the ammunition doesn‚Äôt deal normal Strike damage on a hit, remember to say that! Dealing damage is the default. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.461,r=0.861,b=0.633), with ID 8faf8447-1279-4128-a79b-500f68666b39 -->

Armor and Weapons  
Specific armor and weapons replace the opportunity to add property runes, so you have a lot of space to design. Choose abilities that feel attached to the fact that they are weapons or armor; for instance, a fiery sword that you point at an enemy to shoot fire bolts is more on theme than a fiery sword that casts wall of fire in an unconnected way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.645,r=0.859,b=0.755), with ID fd8c9d00-ea63-4fba-b511-b5d975ac0d63 -->

The specific item should cost more than the base armor or weapon would with just the fundamental runes, but you can often discount the cost of the additional components significantly as part of the specific item‚Äôs special niche. Be careful about specific armor or weapons that include property runes in addition to unique specific abilities. If you discount the item, you might end up with an item significantly superior to one built using the normal property runes system. That‚Äôs not always bad, since it‚Äôs still giving up customization for power, and this can be appropriate if the item has an important place in your story. Just make sure the difference isn‚Äôt too drastic. If you just want to <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.757,r=0.859,b=0.938), with ID bde16098-fdc1-4f53-9346-93f0dac56c7c -->

POTIONS VS. ELIXIRS

Alchemical items and magic items follow a similar price economy based on their level, but the effects of potions can be a bit broader and more directly magical. Alchemists can also make extremely large numbers of elixirs at an item level equal to their alchemist level, so if a 17th-level elixir was competing with a 9th-rank spell for power, an alchemist would be packing the equivalent of over 40 9th-rank spells, and potentially quickened spells thanks to the single action activation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.073,r=0.514,b=0.266), with ID f14cc9b0-940f-44e9-bf41-92fcbd701bc2 -->

create armor or a weapon with runes and no extra special
abilities, you can do so. The Price of such an item is the sum
of all the runes‚Äô Prices, and its level is that of the highest-
level rune on the item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.280,r=0.514,b=0.341), with ID 07485214-758f-4ef8-935d-dd31f1c858a5 -->

When picking abilities, you can also consider taking from
the relic gifts found on pages 309‚Äì319. Even if your game
doesn‚Äôt use relics, that section has plenty of choices sorted
by theme. If you do, keep in mind that relic abilities are
typically more powerful than usual for their level and that
those abilities wouldn‚Äôt scale on a normal magic item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.341,r=0.514,b=0.435), with ID 03f7c26b-f7d8-4b4b-b241-5870c0f6756e -->

Held Items  
Usually, held items should require manipulation to use, with Interact activations. They are most often tools, implements, items that can be thrown, and the like. Imagine a PC physically using the item and what that looks like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.445,r=0.514,b=0.540), with ID fd12e2c4-1dde-4ba5-a080-fb1e5ef5bb35 -->

Remember that held items are more challenging for martial characters to use, compared to spellcasters or hands-free characters, like monks. A barbarian might have to give up a two-handed weapon to use a held item, and so is less likely to use one. This means you might want to design held items specifically for non-martial characters, or have them be items a martial character uses outside of combat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.541,r=0.514,b=0.648), with ID 2b7a7a74-94cc-40d4-931d-6d9296e0e57b -->

Oils
Oils are consumables you slather onto items or, rarely, creatures. They provide an interesting opportunity to apply effects to other items. Just remember not to accidentally make something that should be applied topically into a potion; for instance, a petrified character can‚Äôt drink an anti-petrifying potion! The actions an oil takes to use depend on how thoroughly it needs to be applied. For one used outside of combat, it could take a minute or more. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.659,r=0.513,b=0.816), with ID 7c43d6c8-4bd5-4180-9bde-7fe6d866890c -->

Potions
Potions are consumables in the truest sense; you literally consume them. Since the action of drinking isn‚Äôt easy to split up, they take only a single action to activate. This advantage makes potions that replicate spell effects incredibly powerful, and it‚Äôs the reason potions are nearly always higher level than scrolls with similar effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.828,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 5f38ee28-6116-4107-92a8-ecca10f7ce2e -->

Runes
Property runes are a fun and versatile way to customize
weapons and armor without throwing away the previous
items. Each should be fairly simple, especially at lower levels,
because combining runes can make things overcomplicated.
Compare to other properties to determine the right level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.176), with ID 9b27572f-65b3-4553-b53d-e06ee6d1ae37 -->

Scrolls
You‚Äôll never need to design a new scroll, but use them as a comparison when designing other types of consumables. If you‚Äôre designing a consumable that seems like it‚Äôs much better than a scroll of its level‚Äîor faster to activate‚Äîyou should probably raise the item‚Äôs level or adjust the effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.184,r=0.905,b=0.281), with ID 146aedfd-027c-4d9d-8420-68fe275a6e67 -->

Shields
Use the sturdy shields as benchmarks for the best possible shield Hardness, HP, and BT for a shield of that level. Your new shield should have less than those benchmarks since it also does something else, and you can use the magnitude of the reduction to build room for creative defensive abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.291,r=0.905,b=0.389), with ID 6db3ce45-562d-4296-a6a2-34c3bbe2b521 -->

Staves  
You‚Äôll need to come up with a theme and curate a list of spells that stay close to that theme, typically one to three per spell rank, all on one spell list. A staff is always at least 3 levels higher than the minimum level for a spellcaster to cast the highest-rank spell it contains, so a staff with up to 4th-rank spells would be at least a 10th-level item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.400,r=0.905,b=0.511), with ID af062cb8-2497-4911-9e4f-85b82c7fad0f -->

Structures
Structures are evocative and make great tertiary items, quirky but not part of a combat build. This allows you to price them affordably, but make sure there isn‚Äôt some hidden abuse where the structure drastically alters encounters. The structure trait is intended to help as a starting point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.522,r=0.904,b=0.618), with ID 15836905-833c-43dc-a7da-950cc0a41734 -->

Talisman

Because talismans are affixed ahead of time but don‚Äôt take an action to retrieve, they reward forethought and planning. Those that can be activated as a free action also have the best action efficiency of any consumable. In the same way scrolls reward specific spellcasters, talisman requirements reward particular types of characters. Talismans might grant a single use of a feat, with an additional effect if the character already has that feat. Think of talismans as martial characters‚Äô answer to scrolls to expand on the options of the non-spellcasters at your table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.629,r=0.905,b=0.801), with ID 190b4197-a35b-47a3-b664-91fd013e724a -->

**Wands**  
You won‚Äôt need to design basic *magic wands*, but you might want a special wand. When designing a new special wand, your wand‚Äôs level will usually be 1 to 2 levels higher than the basic wand, depending on the magnitude of the special effect. Remember that if you make the wand 2 levels higher, it‚Äôs now competing with wands of a spell a whole level higher, so the special effect should be worth that cost! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.813,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 5a3265fa-042c-4f4c-acd1-414768adaa63 -->

Worn Items
Worn items vary wildly in their effects, but they all take up one of a character‚Äôs 10 invested items. Remember to include the item‚Äôs worn entry, if applicable (or ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù if you could imagine someone wearing 10 or more with no difficulty). Where the item is worn should usually match its effects or bonuses: shoes help you move, eyepieces affect your vision, and so on. As with held items, imagine a character wearing the item to picture how they use its magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.075,r=0.471,b=0.218), with ID 4fa5e16c-9bb4-4e1f-85a2-68db2540e863 -->

Apex items are always at least level 17 and should have
unique abilities on top of their bonus, just like other items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.219,r=0.470,b=0.251), with ID 24354fc1-bccb-42b9-933c-9fc1b7ba1f74 -->

## Fill in the Numbers
You‚Äôre almost done! The final step is to fill in the numbers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.260,r=0.469,b=0.296), with ID 95cf4141-1fc5-45f3-b2e9-c5c73841c819 -->

DCs
Choose any DCs for the item‚Äôs abilities, typically using the typical DCs in the table below. An item with a narrow function might have a DC up to 2 higher, and one that forces a save (such as with an aura) is typically 2 lower. The lower the DC, the quicker the item becomes obsolete. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.306,r=0.470,b=0.403), with ID 646c0cff-b845-4db0-b4f5-9703084973bd -->

Item Prices  
Each item level has a price range. Based on the item‚Äôs role and abilities, decide where in that range to place it. There‚Äôs plenty of variation, and you primarily need to worry about Price only if you expect the PCs will be able to sell it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.767,r=0.470,b=0.847), with ID 8e61064c-ee38-48dc-9a6d-45fc454bf460 -->

**Primary items** cost near the highest value for their level. They have a big impact on combat or player ability. This includes weapons, armor, and Perception items. The highest price is for items like *runic weapon*, *magic armor*, and apex items. So a *+1 striking weapon* is 100 gp at 4th level.

**Secondary items**, with middle values, give significant <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.847,r=0.470,b=0.938), with ID f1f1a856-6c03-43a7-96a6-06d0e0bf565a -->

secondary benefits or enhance highly consequential
noncombat or support skills like Medicine or Crafting.

Tertiary items, with low value, are weird or very specific
items, ones not usually core to a character‚Äôs build. Especially
strange ones might fall into the gap between two levels. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.081,r=0.860,b=0.158), with ID dc4bf700-e8c3-42f1-a449-f050fbf389a3 -->

# BUILDING WORLDS

*As a Game Master, you control the details of the world your players explore. The Age of Lost Omens campaign setting is a lush world suitable for countless adventures, but you might prefer to adventure in entirely new worlds, where every aspect of the setting and story is yours to decide!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.078,r=0.909,b=0.183), with ID 901ad117-f00e-4db4-b413-955163ca28d4 -->

Building your own campaign world can be a deeply
fulfilling creative process, as it lets you bring to life the
exact setting you envision. It gives you great flexibility,
in that you can build only as much as you need for the
next few adventures, and you can adapt the world on
the fly to meet the demands of your story. It also gives
you great control, allowing you to build precisely the
setting you need for the story you want to tell. Finally, it
bypasses some of the issues that can come with playing
within an existing campaign setting, where you might
create a narrative that contradicts published canon, or
your players might stumble across major plot or setting
spoilers. Whatever your world-building goals, this chapter
guides you through the design process step by step. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.217,r=0.515,b=0.436), with ID 3f7eccbe-9ae6-479f-bcb6-77f359e56641 -->

# DESIGN APPROACH
World building can be approached in many ways, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple preference. Do you start at a high level and zoom in, or do you start small and build up? This section outlines a largely top-down approach, but you can design from the bottom up simply by starting at the end of this section and working backward. Either way, you may find yourself skipping between sections as inspiration strikes‚Äîand that‚Äôs OK! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.444,r=0.515,b=0.586), with ID 6cd49d87-861b-4d96-ba6c-41e00bb04c3d -->

When building a world, there‚Äôs a risk of becoming
overwhelmed by the sheer number of decisions to be
made. Remember that you don‚Äôt need to make every
decision for every aspect of your world all at once. Focus
first on the elements you need for your story and the
game, then add as much of the rest as you‚Äôd like. You‚Äôll
also want to allow room for input from your players‚Äî
gaming sessions are more memorable and engaging when
the storytelling experience is shared between everyone
at the table (page 32 has more information on players
contributing to the narrative). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.587,r=0.515,b=0.755), with ID f564a7dd-9619-4bdf-b4e2-268f0e169966 -->

Before you decide anything else, however, you should
establish your concept and your goals. Do you envision
a high-magic steampunk setting where humans are a tiny
minority? A world where the only magic derives from
squabbling pantheons of gods whose followers are caught
up in their wars for power? A quaint town isolated from
an otherwise-unknown world beyond a vast, impenetrable
forest of mist-choked, skeletal trees? Are you designing a
world for a multi-year campaign, or for a fast-paced one-
shot adventure? Having an idea in mind will help steer
your choices as you build your world, and knowing your
goals will help you focus on building what you need. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.755,r=0.514,b=0.939), with ID 40ed2096-5342-4044-a46a-6e09e09bb95c -->

Top Down
The top-down approach is great if you have a lot of time to dedicate to world building. When designing a setting from the top down, your initial focus is on the big picture. You may already have an idea of the big movers and shakers of your world or your multiverse. You may want to chronicle a thousand years or more of the setting‚Äôs history. You may have already sketched out a world map with continents, nations, and trade routes spanning the globe. This approach begins with broad generalities that get more detailed during play and as you design them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.216,r=0.906,b=0.404), with ID a5a3dc72-2d6f-4441-8e07-f285e6dda29a -->

Bottom Up
With a bottom-up approach to world building, you start small and local. Focus on the starting location and immediate needs of your campaign, then expand outward as the story unfolds. This strategy works well for those with less time to devote to world building, as you need to prepare only the minimum detail necessary to entice your players toward adventure, fleshing out your world only as the campaign requires it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.414,r=0.906,b=0.557), with ID ca0918c1-5aca-43e6-b945-8ae0179f8d7e -->

**The World**
While world building might include designing much more than a single planet, most adventures occur entirely on one world. It‚Äôs a good idea to have a broad understanding of that world as a whole. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.566,r=0.904,b=0.649), with ID 3379d184-4552-4a54-849e-16d9be648220 -->

**Planetary Basics**  
When designing the physical features of a campaign world, you‚Äôll want to determine its shape and the general distribution of landmasses. You can also establish the world‚Äôs size, though note that the scale of a world generally has a fairly small impact on the adventures taking place there. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.659,r=0.904,b=0.770), with ID 2ff0000a-0a9e-4403-841a-c5f25c3a0359 -->

Shape
In a fantasy setting, the shape of your world need not be spherical as governed by the laws of physics. It could be any shape you desire, and it might not be a planet at all!
   Globe: Barring some catastrophe, worlds in our reality are roughly spherical due to the influence of gravity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.783,r=0.903,b=0.876), with ID 4270c9e3-5344-4d1b-9f58-d075255541cb -->

**Hollow World:** What if the landmasses and civilizations of a world existed on the inner surface of a hollow sphere? In such a world, the horizon would climb upwards, permitting creatures to see landmarks <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.878,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 3cfbc003-4d26-40a0-befe-e3ff559ae173 -->

Irregular: What if your world is flat, a toroid, or shaped into a cylinder, cube, or other polyhedron? What if it‚Äôs something even stranger? With such an unusual shape, you may need to decide how gravity, atmosphere, and other details function. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.127,r=0.475,b=0.206), with ID 600e12bb-7ec0-4781-81cc-97b8f4a875ac -->

Landmass  
The next major step in world creation is to sketch out the planet‚Äôs oceans and major landmasses. On Earth, these geological features are the result of plate tectonics. In a fantasy world, however, the oceans might have been cleaved from the land by the actions of titans, or the continents shaped to suit a god‚Äôs whims. The following are some common landmass types. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.213,r=0.475,b=0.342), with ID ccad4653-ba1e-4d56-b140-95f24e9dc5b2 -->

**Archipelago:** A stretch of vast ocean, dotted by chains  
of small island groups, atolls, and islets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.342,r=0.474,b=0.373), with ID 5cf525a5-3c93-4d04-a8bc-4a9231f57c00 -->

**Major Islands:** A region of seas dominated by large islands, each several hundred miles across. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.373,r=0.475,b=0.403), with ID 9d4bd33a-9d05-47bc-854e-397019838949 -->

**Island-Continent:** An enormous island nearly the size  
of a continent, surrounded by ocean. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.403,r=0.473,b=0.433), with ID 7241c641-5fce-4135-8851-4b321823f27f -->

**Continent:** A substantial landform that (usually) rests on a tectonic plate and gradually shifts in position over geologic timescales. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.434,r=0.473,b=0.480), with ID a1c64d8c-ef33-41c0-8bd1-2de330f3c779 -->

**Supercontinent:** An assembly of the world's continental blocks into a single immense landmass. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.479,r=0.473,b=0.512), with ID 4b6df8be-0c70-4977-8545-2052e693570c -->

**Environment**
The environment and terrain of a region can pose as much of a challenge to an adventuring party as any of the foes they face. The following section references the environment categories beginning on page 90. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.518,r=0.474,b=0.605), with ID e2973467-f950-477f-94d2-358b34462cd6 -->

Common Environments  
The following environments are common enough that they might appear in nearly any adventure or world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.612,r=0.473,b=0.663), with ID 3fe08934-83bc-4111-a8f6-74a8930e14eb -->

**Aquatic:** Oceans, seas, lakes, and other large waterways are aquatic environments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.665,r=0.472,b=0.695), with ID 8f941624-e78a-4529-9b13-78cee8c4dc1a -->

**Arctic:** Arctic environments usually appear near the northern and southern extremes of a world, though extreme elevation, unusually shaped worlds, and supernatural forces could result in arctic terrain elsewhere. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.695,r=0.473,b=0.756), with ID 2b8d19b8-5a46-41ea-8cc9-64a45bfb90e4 -->

**Desert:** Deserts can appear anywhere on a world where precipitation is scant, even along some oceans. Any large landmasses that entirely lack bodies of water are likely to be deserts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.756,r=0.472,b=0.817), with ID 0db7dc1b-84d1-4a36-933f-3feae60f5970 -->

**Forest:** The composition of a forest depends on the climate and the elevation, with thick jungles more common near an equator, hardwood forests in more temperate zones, and evergreens at higher latitudes and elevations. Most worlds have a tree line‚Äîan elevation above which trees can‚Äôt grow. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.817,r=0.473,b=0.908), with ID 27ee1c16-3669-4b70-b95e-d6a315cca4bf -->

**Mountain:** A world‚Äôs highest peaks can stretch tens
of thousands of feet above sea level. This category also <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.908,r=0.474,b=0.941), with ID 388c795e-d94a-45c0-a043-ec2f91420da1 -->

feet tall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.078,r=0.862,b=0.111), with ID cd8edba7-a50b-4aff-8b9c-79b63dfe9707 -->

**Plains:** Mostly flat and unobstructed, plains are usually at lower elevations, but they can also be found at higher elevations on plateaus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.112,r=0.863,b=0.158), with ID 0c27866a-3715-448a-bad2-b57f9838d555 -->

**Urban:** Cities and settlements are urban environments. These areas are detailed in Settlements, beginning on page 168. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.159,r=0.864,b=0.204), with ID 19e019c5-26da-4d32-ac5d-3f640bb1c223 -->

**Swamp:** Wide floodplains, shallow lakes, and marshes can appear at most latitudes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.205,r=0.864,b=0.236), with ID 6b6b498a-7805-4852-91f3-a070828baa14 -->

**Extreme Environments**  
Some adventures lead to fantastic reaches of the world or the multiverse that are seldom tread by mortals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.245,r=0.863,b=0.296), with ID 144d57f4-e25d-4af1-8a93-4bbeb3622eb9 -->

**Aerial:** A world might include windy realms of floating islands and castles in the clouds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.296,r=0.864,b=0.326), with ID f461ec86-2bef-4cf3-9958-460844c480a3 -->

**Glacier:** Massive sheets of dense ice constantly moving under their own immense weight, glaciers are frozen wastelands riddled with columns of jagged ice and snow-covered crevasses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.326,r=0.865,b=0.387), with ID be93740f-e636-4b64-9f81-76f4bd8bfc93 -->

**Underground:** Some worlds have deep natural caverns, while others have extensive winding tunnels and expansive realms below the surface. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.464,r=0.865,b=0.511), with ID 29ae9791-bbf1-46d6-9caf-7527216c84b0 -->

## Mapping a World
Many Game Masters like to have an overland map for their local region, nation, or even the whole world. The primary goal of this scale of map is to designate sites of import to the campaign; you don‚Äôt need to detail every hamlet or woodland grove, but having a sense of the major features can help you and the other players visualize the world in which you‚Äôre playing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.519,r=0.865,b=0.648), with ID 98b20047-d038-4ccb-85c8-39b4d17147c9 -->

Step 1. Coastlines: The easiest first step is to separate land from sea. Regional maps may only have a single shoreline, if any. At larger map scales, consider the placement of major islands, archipelago chains, atolls, and islets. A world map should consider the size and placement of continents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.649,r=0.866,b=0.740), with ID 2e8f132e-faad-4e8e-b011-bc1dc6be25e9 -->

Step 2. Topography: Pencil in a rough ridgeline for each mountain range in the region. Mountain ranges are common along coastlines where continental plates push together. If extended into the sea, mountain ranges typically result in a chain of offshore islands. Indicate hills in the regions adjacent to the mountains and elsewhere as necessary to demonstrate elevation. Unmarked terrain on an overland map is usually lowland plains. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.740,r=0.865,b=0.862), with ID 57e835af-dcd8-4f00-b510-b9cf9885ca24 -->

**Step 3. Watercourses:** It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that rivers flow downstream, from high elevation toward the sea, always taking the path of least resistance. Powerful watercourses might carve canyons or gorges over millennia, but they should never cross through <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.863,r=0.865,b=0.941), with ID 31688e18-c65f-4273-b6a6-4757ae95d093 -->

CAMPAIGN REFERENCE  
Before the campaign starts, you might want to begin the outline for a campaign reference: a living document that you can easily review and annotate during gameplay and that records the geography, factions, history, characters, and plots central to your campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.015,r=0.512,b=0.208), with ID 9b135627-0e44-43b4-baaf-7214ef3b5823 -->

mountain ranges. On a similar note, watercourses  
don‚Äôt branch‚Äîtributaries join into rivers as they flow  
downstream. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.218,r=0.516,b=0.264), with ID 109ef7d2-f8e5-42b5-8f1e-d4e5690094b0 -->

Step 4. Terrain and Environment: Sketch in interesting terrain features such as forests, deserts, or tundras. You may want to differentiate these by climate, separating coniferous and deciduous forests from tropical jungles or arctic taigas. Terrain not specifically called out on an overland map is typically presumed to be some variety of grassland. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.266,r=0.515,b=0.371), with ID 5870570d-9d3a-49fa-a08c-62ce49cfff01 -->

Step 5. Civilization: Now you‚Äôre ready to place the elements of civilization. Major cities should typically be located near fresh water and natural resources. Major roads connect larger settlements, circumventing forests and other difficult terrain, but they may wind through mountain passes when lucrative commerce demands it. Add smaller settlements along your roads, further connected by smaller roads and trails. Finally, draw political boundaries and mark other sites of interest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.372,r=0.514,b=0.512), with ID 8a0fd388-9e8a-4df7-a0a4-7d2b71ac659a -->

# CIVILIZATION
With the major geographical features and terrain of your world decided, it‚Äôs time to establish significant nations and settlements. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.520,r=0.514,b=0.586), with ID 328d60f6-0f7b-4de5-9aca-e706845b55ce -->

When it comes to designing a world‚Äôs cultures, you
might want to focus primarily on areas the party is
likely to explore first. This allows you to establish
the details and depth of one region‚Äôs peoples before
expanding out to address others. That‚Äôs not to say you
shouldn‚Äôt have ideas about the cultures beyond your
starting settlement‚Äîit just means you don‚Äôt need to
decide every detail of every culture all at once. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.587,r=0.514,b=0.708), with ID 30969b0c-2d0e-46be-a53e-3b533b35048e -->

As always, you don‚Äôt need to demarcate every realm on the globe or indicate every town, hamlet, and thorp. Keep your focus on what you need for your story and your adventure‚Äîleaving terra incognita can lead to stories down the road as the party ventures further from home. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.709,r=0.513,b=0.787), with ID dc8afd4d-b95e-4cd7-9f28-22e5cd9e1c70 -->

**Societal Benchmarks**  
The following sections can help you establish certain truths about your world as a whole. From there, you can decide the details of specific cultural groups, including whether they deviate from these global standards. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.797,r=0.513,b=0.878), with ID 81d6f048-337c-4c6e-b8af-1cce5410b99a -->

technology in warfare, agriculture, and industry. The
following categories roughly approximate real-world
technological levels, but progress might vary on your
world. What heights of technology have been achieved?
Have any groups fallen behind or leaped ahead? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.157), with ID cceb98bb-8aaa-44be-9ff4-24829fa0cd10 -->

Primeval: Weapons and tools in this early era are crafted primarily from bone, wood, or stone. Knowledge of stonecutting allows early civilizations to raise stone walls and buildings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.158,r=0.904,b=0.218), with ID 87506842-1a07-45b5-ae8b-87ce1e434a4d -->

**Ancient:** Advancements in mining and metallurgy lead to weapons and tools made from bronze. Crop rotation and storage in granaries ensure greater survival in times of famine. Trade between river and coastal settlements is aided by oar- and sail-powered galleys. Chariots come into strong use during warfare. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.219,r=0.903,b=0.310), with ID e39f5259-184f-4483-b3d8-1dc278d42206 -->

**Classical:** Superior military tactics and engineered roads allow for rapid deployment of infantry wielding iron weapons and aided by mounted cavalry. Advances in complex irrigation and construction of aqueducts lead to an abundance of harvest foods and dramatic improvements to sanitation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.311,r=0.903,b=0.402), with ID f4809ac2-02a0-4655-a6c8-e7bf92aa9d0d -->

**Medieval:** Warfare in this era is defined by iron armor, crossbows, and weapons forged of fine steel. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.403,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID 37a97ebf-e584-4aa9-829e-9d2c19f97391 -->

**Enlightenment:** The development of black powder and muzzle-loaded, single-shot firearms greatly changes warfare, making plate armor mostly obsolete. Larger ships permit ocean crossings and long-range trade to distant shores. The printing press speeds literacy and the dissemination of new ideas. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.434,r=0.904,b=0.524), with ID 2286cb4c-4081-458d-b53e-5c56baca8908 -->

**Steam:** Steam engines replace conveyances drawn by animal power or sail, leading to a significant shift from wood fuel to coal. Further advances in science lead to dirigible airships and observation balloons. Simple firearms are replaced by repeating revolvers and bolt-action rifles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.526,r=0.903,b=0.617), with ID ef9bc30f-9abb-4a73-ac2d-ed97e235e219 -->

Divine Involvement  
What is the nature of the gods? Do they even exist?  
If so, are they omnipotent and omniscient? How does  
a follower request their divine favor? The answers to  
these questions will help you determine how strongly  
divine faith impacts the cultures of your world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.629,r=0.902,b=0.723), with ID ebc6cd8e-3eba-4345-b96c-fc7df0aa4353 -->

**None:** Deities do not exist in this world, or if they  
do, they are oblivious to or completely unconcerned  
with mortal affairs. If they exist, they don‚Äôt make their  
presence known, nor do they grant power to their  
worshippers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.725,r=0.902,b=0.800), with ID dcd16f21-b4dc-4a21-baf8-ce27e7720658 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting a lively city scene with a blend of classical and futuristic architectural elements, showing people engaged in daily activities in a public square.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a bustling city square populated by people of various ages and attire, including children playing, adults walking, and a person on horseback.
  ‚Ä¢ The setting features a mix of domed and arched buildings with ornate details, trees lining the square, and a market stall with a canopy on the right.
  ‚Ä¢ The perspective is from a slightly elevated viewpoint, looking into the square and through a large decorative archway toward more buildings in the background.
  ‚Ä¢ The lighting is warm and natural, suggesting late afternoon or early morning, with soft shadows and a partly cloudy sky.
  ‚Ä¢ The colour palette includes warm earth tones, golds, and muted greens, with blue sky and soft sunlight.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image text or UI elements are visible.
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration style is semi-realistic with painterly shading and smooth gradients.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ Foreground: Several figures, including a person on horseback and a woman in a headscarf, are closest to the viewer.
  ‚Ä¢ Midground: Children are running, and more people are walking or standing near the trees and archway.
  ‚Ä¢ Background: Large, ornate buildings with domes and towers, some under construction with visible scaffolding, dominate the skyline.
  ‚Ä¢ The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the archway and domed buildings drawing the eye toward the center and right of the image.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration conveys a sense of cultural richness and urban vibrancy, blending historical and futuristic elements.
  ‚Ä¢ The presence of both traditional clothing and advanced architecture suggests a setting where old and new coexist.
  ‚Ä¢ The market and public gathering space indicate a community-oriented environment, while the construction in the background hints at ongoing development and change. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.061,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 4a744587-9d67-40e4-9ce0-f54502dcc1c2 -->

Magic
Does magic exist? If so, which traditions are available?
What are the sources of a spellcaster‚Äôs power, and how
do they gain and channel that magic?
   No Magic: Magic of any kind does not exist in
this world. Spells and magic effects do not function.
Consider the variants on page 82 to handle the lack of
magic items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.582,r=0.471,b=0.708), with ID 5e013f55-56cf-4b05-b6c9-5e90d931f4e8 -->

**Low Magic:** Magic is mysterious and taboo. The few practitioners of the mystical arts are feared or shunned. The few practitioners of the mystical arts are feared or shunned. Again, consider the variants on page 82 to handle the relative scarcity of magic items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.709,r=0.471,b=0.770), with ID f02f2adb-0ef8-407f-b744-69c15466e0a3 -->

**Common:** Magic is an accepted fact of everyday life, though its mysteries are beyond the reach of most people. Magic portals and gates can whisk travelers ‚Äúin the know‚Äù halfway across the world or to the other side of the multiverse. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.771,r=0.471,b=0.847), with ID 22045da5-bcf1-426b-9917-59360898fde2 -->

**High Magic:** Magic and magical items are commonplace in society. It may be as easy to learn spellcasting as it is to learn a new language. Magical objects simulate various modern technologies to great effect and are just as accessible. The fantastic is never more than a stone‚Äôs throw away. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.848,r=0.471,b=0.939), with ID 12bf4f8b-95df-46d1-9935-f7648a5cc36c -->

Designing Nations
For any nation you establish in your setting, you‚Äôll want to provide at least a minimal description‚Äîthe core concept of that nation. The amount of additional detail you provide depends on the needs of your story. You likely want to establish enough information to create a stat block (page 130) for the nation your adventurers are from, any nations they‚Äôre likely to spend significant time in, and those nations‚Äô main allied and enemy nations, if they are likely to become part of the plot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.536,r=0.862,b=0.694), with ID 15acc027-1d5f-43bf-86e0-1042a6b6ec23 -->

When building a nation, remember that the various
elements connect to the history of the land and its
people, its relationships with nearby nations, and the
current residents. This interconnectedness will help you
build a wealth of story hooks and provide immersive
detail for your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.694,r=0.863,b=0.786), with ID a76d48f2-41be-4336-9bc4-32976bbc8cf3 -->

Beyond those basic details, the following considerations
can help flesh out the nations in your setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.786,r=0.863,b=0.817), with ID 8a9cba5c-f6a3-455d-aebe-b112d4d77cef -->

Location, Size, and Population
Major geographical boundaries, such as mountains, seas, and large rivers, often present natural borders for a realm. Depending on its leadership, culture, and the resources available, a country may be as small as a city-state or as large as a continent-sweeping empire.

Summary : This image shows a decorative UI element with a number, likely representing a resource or score in a game interface.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is a stylized green and gold decorative border with symmetrical curves and a central diamond shape.
  ‚Ä¢ Below the decoration, a tan rectangular box contains the number ‚Äú137‚Äù in bold, dark red font.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is dark brown, and the overall palette is green, gold, tan, and dark red.
Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The number ‚Äú137‚Äù is clearly visible and centered in the box.
  ‚Ä¢ No other UI elements or text are visible in this crop.
Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The decorative element is at the top, with the number box directly below it.
  ‚Ä¢ The number is horizontally centered within the box.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image likely represents a resource counter, score, or inventory value in a game, with the number ‚Äú137‚Äù being the current value. The ornate design suggests a fantasy or medieval theme. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.899,t=0.925,r=1.000,b=0.982), with ID 7da5686e-c42e-4516-9326-8523df8d6431 -->

**CONSCIENTIOUS CULTURE DESIGN**  
Creating fantasy cultures is a delicate topic, as it can be all too easy to create a culture or a group based on damaging stereotypes or simplistic reductions of real-world groups. Creating entire cultures out of harmful genre tropes such as ‚Äújungle heathen‚Äù or ‚Äúnoble samurai‚Äù reduces real-world cultures to caricatures and perpetuates misconceptions about people from those cultures. Taking inspiration from the real world is wonderful‚Äîour world is filled with an incredible diversity of cultures and peoples‚Äîbut you should do so with care and respect for those sources. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.074,r=0.513,b=0.281), with ID 664fc01d-b1c8-4cd9-b246-0602be058fa1 -->

and communication, most nations remain relatively
small (only a few hundred miles across), simply because
it becomes too difficult for a single governing entity to
oversee and maintain the entirety of a larger state. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.294,r=0.514,b=0.356), with ID 65cb96cd-5fd9-4662-8169-335f2cbb3f28 -->

National populations ebb and flow due to a multitude
of external factors. Advances in sanitation, medicine,
and agriculture can spur dramatic population growth,
while war, famine, or plague can devastate it. As a
rule, smaller nation-states have a population around a
hundred thousand, while a continent-spanning empire
could swell to well over a hundred million. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.357,r=0.514,b=0.464), with ID 56c2ac4d-16bb-4f8d-bd32-c4b67bd5c4b1 -->

Population size is only part of the equation.
Figuring out the ancestry ratios of that population and
brainstorming how the members of various ancestries
interact can often lead to interesting story ideas, or at
least give you some jumping-off points when dreaming
up how the nation was founded and its later history. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.464,r=0.514,b=0.557), with ID 36d86c7b-504f-4a9c-93dd-9df5c641826d -->

Cultural Hallmarks  
What elements of the nation‚Äôs predominant culture stand out? A nation might have an unusual stance on religion, a specific demographic, distinctive natural features, noteworthy political views, or any number of unique elements that differentiate it from other nations in your region. These hallmarks can inform your decisions about many other aspects of the nation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.568,r=0.513,b=0.694), with ID 82f31566-8656-44f0-88a5-0115f4840405 -->

History  
How did the nation come to be? Has it stood since time immemorial, a bastion of stability while the rest of the world changes around it? Perhaps it was built over the ruins of another civilization, destroyed by some forgotten calamity. Or perhaps it is a young nation, born recently amid ongoing strife in your world. What remnants of the past can be found, or has the past been deliberately hidden? How have the residents of the nation adapted to change, and in what ways have they failed to do so? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.706,r=0.513,b=0.863), with ID f4764653-69ec-4022-981b-60a806de6f54 -->

Economy and Political Stances  
Determine the key resources and industries that drive the nation‚Äôs economy. The availability of natural resources can establish national boundaries, local industry, and other <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.875,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID c425b3b9-b67f-4b20-9449-38c02030d596 -->

elements of the resident society. For example, an area with
few resources might have a nomadic society, while a nation
rich in resources might develop an opulent mercantile class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.903,b=0.126), with ID 2b7669b6-8e05-4f1e-a2f4-bb8b46e9d274 -->

These resources can also affect international
relationships. An area poor in a specific resource might
have a strong trade relationship with a nearby nation
that has it, or they might be at war! Nations also disagree
about political structures, public policy, religion, and
any number of other factors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.127,r=0.903,b=0.218), with ID c82c676d-79e6-4081-93f5-185196b221fe -->

You‚Äôll also want to consider the significant NPCs of each nation. This includes the official rulers, but it also includes other major players, whether they act in an official capacity or entirely behind the scenes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.219,r=0.903,b=0.280), with ID 7d954c9d-e318-4f51-b269-38c73bc4366c -->

Building Settlements  
In Pathfinder, settlements are where characters can rest, recharge, retrain, and dedicate themselves to other downtime activities all in relative peace. Traditionally, an adventuring band comes together in some kind of settlement, be it a small hamlet nestled on the border of some wild frontier or a bustling port city at the heart of a nation. Some adventures take place entirely within a single settlement, while in others the party visits settlements only briefly between their adventures in the wilderness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.291,r=0.904,b=0.447), with ID d1415d58-a8f3-49bf-8532-43fdecc18eac -->

The first thing you should consider when building
a settlement is its role in your story. Is this a major
metropolis the heroes will visit again and again during
their adventurers? A backwater village where their
adventures begin? The distant capital from which an
evil tyrant issues cruel edicts? The settlement‚Äôs campaign
role will inform many of the other decisions you make
about the place. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.449,r=0.904,b=0.571), with ID 370fad7d-3464-4ff2-9e66-2fe3ee168882 -->

Once you know why you need the settlement,
consider why it would exist in the world. Settlements
are typically founded near sources of fresh drinking
water; most commonly along a riverbank or a place with
access to adequate wells or springs. They additionally
require some kind of transit to other places, either
roads or waterways. While it may be easier to create
a village or city merely to serve the characters‚Äô needs,
determining what function it has independent of the
characters adds verisimilitude and can provide hooks
for further stories. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.572,r=0.904,b=0.738), with ID d4807971-6a6a-443c-8396-1b69745f6961 -->

Settlements, on page 168, describes the components
of a settlement stat block, which you should create for
any settlement you expect your characters to visit. The
process of creating that stat block will help you further
flesh out your community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.740,r=0.903,b=0.815), with ID 2a5ef301-abdc-43df-ab21-6ef32aea4aac -->

Mapping a Settlement  
Don‚Äôt underestimate the usefulness of sketching a map of significant settlements, like the one where your adventure starts. This isn‚Äôt intended to be a picture-perfect rendition drawn to scale, but rather to outline the rough shape and size of the settlement. Be sure to highlight a few key structures useful to the campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.830,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID f28915a5-f5e8-4f85-9c1e-7ed1e28453df -->

Summary : The image shows a large, bold numeral "2" with a dark brown fill and a light yellow outline, centered on a textured yellow-brown background.

logo: 
Scene Overview : 
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is the number "2" in a bold, sans-serif font.
  ‚Ä¢ The numeral is dark brown with a thin, light yellow outline.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is a mottled, textured yellow-brown color.
Technical Details : 
  ‚Ä¢ No additional text, symbols, or branding elements are present.
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or UI elements.
Spatial Relationships : 
  ‚Ä¢ The numeral "2" is centered within the image.
  ‚Ä¢ No other foreground or background elements are present.
Analysis : 
  ‚Ä¢ The design is simple and clear, likely intended for emphasis or as a step/label marker. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.905,t=0.012,r=0.980,b=0.055), with ID 474e3109-ed1e-493e-bba9-151ab5e01d62 -->

Step 1. City Layout: The layout of a settlement is as unique as the terrain upon which it is settled. First, decide the major trade route for the settlement. This is typically a river, which brings fresh water, fish, and fast transport to the populace. Larger cities can sustain additional growth with access to a deep-water harbor or a major overland trade road. Even settlements conceived with a grid plan tend to stretch along established trade routes before expanding outward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.077,r=0.474,b=0.220), with ID 9d243300-46a1-4dfd-874a-dadb16565378 -->

Step 2. Districts: Towns with a population over a thousand typically have defensive walls. As a settlement grows further in size and population, additional stone fortifications are often constructed beyond the city center, which further segment the city into districts or boroughs. A metropolis, for example, might have several distinct neighborhoods: Castle Ward, Noble Quarter, Temple Hill, the Gardens, Scholars‚Äô Court, Artisan Plaza, the docks, the slums, and so forth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.219,r=0.474,b=0.356), with ID 1dcbd42a-91f5-480a-9989-da234844cb5d -->

Step 3. Markets and Shops: Designate one or more open spaces in the settlement for a market square. This marketplace typically grows in the city center, along a major road intersecting the settlement‚Äôs primary trade route. Lining the perimeter of the temporary tents and stalls of a bazaar are permanent retail shops offering pricier goods and services. Here in the beating heart of city commerce, adventurers can prepare themselves for upcoming expeditions or sell their ill-gotten gains upon their return. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.356,r=0.475,b=0.509), with ID e85d2632-6dc0-474f-9b44-532957e08344 -->

Step 4. Inns: Heroes need a place to celebrate and recover between adventures. In addition to both public and private lodging, a settlement‚Äôs inns often serve food and drink. As with the town market, inns are commonly built in central locations where trade roads meet. In your campaign, inns are ideal locations to spread gossip, introduce notable NPCs, and initiate quests. For the right price, innkeepers might rent strongboxes to secure money and other valuables between adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.510,r=0.474,b=0.647), with ID ebee55c4-612b-408d-904a-6b4185e12177 -->

Step 5. Landmarks: To give your cities a sense of personality and local flavor, design a handful of iconic landmarks for the PCs to visit. Memorable names make these landmarks more interesting. A random observatory might be noteworthy, but the Celestial Watchtower has an air of intrigue that could lead to a fun adventure hook. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.647,r=0.475,b=0.743), with ID 81acc9d9-cb0a-48cd-b7e4-5dffe4c87f99 -->

RELIGION
The greatest stories from myth and legend speak of immortals with incredible powers of creation and destruction. Some meddle in the affairs of mortals, shaping heroes and history at a whim, while others remain aloof or oblivious to the mortal world. Regardless of the world you‚Äôre building, religion (or even the absence thereof) shapes the people and the stories you tell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.749,r=0.475,b=0.881), with ID 616bbdec-f9a0-41a0-9689-538244689701 -->

**Theology**  
Religious traditions are commonly categorized by their  
belief in one or more divine entities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.886,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID e5d45fec-aee5-4901-8d1f-7093d15db5b6 -->

**Polytheism:** This belief system posits the existence of many gods. Polytheistic gods typically espouse particular areas of concern and often reflect the appearance of their worshippers. The primary religious philosophy of the Age of Lost Omens is polytheistic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.078,r=0.865,b=0.158), with ID 4d5102eb-10c4-492c-a4ba-b288e75b758d -->

**Dualism:** This philosophy espouses an enduring conflict between two diametrically opposed cosmic forces; most commonly good and evil or law and chaos. Acolytes of each faith almost always see themselves as righteous, and those of the contrasting belief as false. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.157,r=0.866,b=0.234), with ID cb34afe5-2f4e-408c-afe3-a61a6c9fa470 -->

**Monotheism:** A monotheistic doctrine recognizes the existence of only one true god. The supreme deity may exhibit more than one aspect yet remain a single entity, like Gozreh from the Age of Lost Omens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.235,r=0.867,b=0.296), with ID 10f36bf1-0739-4432-ae89-87024bc7097d -->

**Pantheism:** Divine power arises from the universe itself, or as a byproduct of the collective power of many deities sharing some common facet, either way forming a vast, all-encompassing divine entity. Worshippers sometimes appeal to or devote themselves to specific fundamental concepts or aspects of the universe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.296,r=0.867,b=0.387), with ID 60bc3ee8-842a-45d7-89a5-75a0c9f43994 -->

**Animism:** Rather than worshipping gods associated with souls and spiritual essence from beyond, animism sees the life force in each part of the world, whether it be the trees of an old-growth forest or a towering waterfall. An example of animism in the Age of Lost Omens is the connection between the Shoanti people and their totems, which they forge a relationship with when they come of age. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.387,r=0.867,b=0.495), with ID c0deaa95-1bf1-477e-9f18-4ecc319f259a -->

**Atheism:** In some campaign worlds, the gods have all died, abandoned their worshippers, or never existed at all. Mortals of this world may still cling to belief and establish religions in the name of the divine, but there are no true deities to answer their prayers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.495,r=0.868,b=0.574), with ID e57f506c-2a0a-424f-bf86-63859f0ae614 -->

In polytheistic traditions, a pantheon is a divine hierarchy of multiple (or even all) deities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.581,r=0.865,b=0.632), with ID b02e0f15-0e77-4fd1-9c66-41e25fbc69fc -->

**Universal:** All deities in the setting belong to a single pantheon. Different cultures might have their own names for the god of magic, for instance, but only a single deity answers their prayers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.633,r=0.866,b=0.694), with ID 0a0eb8a9-fd7f-4640-8f26-918285c24f2e -->

**Ancestral or Regional:** Each ancestry or region worships its own distinct pantheon. These pantheons coexist in the same cosmology but establish control in separate divine realms. Across the cosmos, several gods from disparate pantheons may share the same area of concern, but they seldom compete for worshippers from rival pantheons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.694,r=0.866,b=0.786), with ID bff11ac1-a310-4b6f-b866-68fb8cda50c8 -->

**Competitive:** The world contains smaller regional pantheons competing for mortal worship. Only one deity of a specific area of concern may ascend to greater power across all the pantheons. As such, deities typically have little loyalty to their own pantheons and may actually switch to another pantheon if it earns them additional worshippers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.786,r=0.866,b=0.893), with ID c479352e-75ef-4fc2-a648-06e26b019139 -->

**None:** The deities of this multiverse act as individuals
with no familial ties or common agendas binding them to
each other. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.893,r=0.866,b=0.940), with ID 99253895-2fe1-425e-b2ad-b1f334fbef9b -->

Deities  
These immortal beings command vast power and influence fueled by the faith and souls of mortal worshippers. In Pathfinder, deities also dictate some of the abilities of those champions and clerics who channel their power. When designing deities, you‚Äôll need to include the divine statistics and devotee benefits described below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.076,r=0.515,b=0.191), with ID f24903c9-0dea-483f-a1da-332ce314833a -->

Divine Rank  
Gods are usually ranked in a divine hierarchy, from newly ascended godlings to almighty creator gods of unfathomable power. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.200,r=0.514,b=0.263), with ID 0a58ad38-c21f-4883-a288-1736045ee26c -->

**God:** Taking a position atop the divine pyramid, gods command near unlimited power and resources. Their mortal congregations are large and (usually) well funded. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.265,r=0.513,b=0.311), with ID e8643bfb-e8c0-497f-9aec-c8f79c3bca5c -->

**Demigod:** Demigods still possess a great deal of power, though often in subservience to another god or simply inferior to the power of a full god. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.311,r=0.512,b=0.356), with ID 311260eb-56ad-47c2-9805-8a29fd35b9ab -->

**Quasi Deity:** The weakest rank of divinity, many quasi deities are recently ascended mortals who attained their deific powers through ritual apotheosis, or planar natives who have amassed divine power of their own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.357,r=0.513,b=0.418), with ID 8c4701aa-5b61-4ef1-9936-c6832076ce6f -->

Divine Statistics  
In Pathfinder, deities are not only a narrative element of the world, but also a mechanical component of some classes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.430,r=0.512,b=0.478), with ID 3af8245e-49b4-4930-ae87-9796b6d428a9 -->

Areas of Concern: Each deity has one or more areas
of concern they have divine influence over. These
portfolios typically embrace universal concepts, such as
honor, night, or tranquility. Deities with similar areas
of concern may work in common cause or against each
other, depending on their goals and divine rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.480,r=0.512,b=0.571), with ID 318ab026-152f-41d9-a1d2-7409caf1d3b1 -->

Edicts: Every deity has edicts, which are those tenets they require their faithful‚Äîespecially divinely empowered clergy like champions and clerics‚Äîto promote in the world. A deity usually has one to three simple and straightforward edicts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.572,r=0.512,b=0.648), with ID fb2ed056-e2c4-4771-8ead-00cc67ff2ea4 -->

**Anathema:** The opposite of edicts, anathema are those things a deity will not abide. Champions and clerics must avoid their deity‚Äôs anathema or risk losing their divine powers, and even lay worshippers usually feel guilty for performing such acts, as they will be weighed against them in the afterlife. Like edicts, a deity usually has two to three simple and straightforward elements to their anathema. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.649,r=0.512,b=0.755), with ID b5e56d0f-7110-4b78-90a2-190dc2fd3e92 -->

Devotee Benefits  
Deities grant favored status and special power to the most fervent and influential of their flock. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.768,r=0.511,b=0.815), with ID c4f2a171-9b3d-476b-aff9-36cc907f328a -->

**Cleric Spells:** When preparing spells, clerics can choose from specific spells granted by the deity, in addition to those available on the divine spell list. A deity always grants a 1st-rank spell and usually two others, all chosen from non-divine spell lists. The exact number of spells a deity grants can vary‚Äîa magic-focused deity might grant more‚Äîthough this shouldn‚Äôt exceed one spell of each rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.817,r=0.512,b=0.939), with ID af2e8677-4f16-4f8a-b8f4-f835465c41a3 -->

**Divine Font:** Clerics channel a deity‚Äôs divine power as a font of vitality or void energy. Most deities grant either *heal* or *harm*, but a few deities offer a choice between the two. A specific deity‚Äôs divine font should be based on their areas of concern. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.157), with ID 43ae091c-5bcf-413a-9b0e-efc526a3cc87 -->

**Divine Sanctification:** Some deities allow or require their greatest devotees, typically champions and clerics, to dedicate themselves to pursuing holy or unholy deeds. A listing of ‚Äúmust choose holy‚Äù or ‚Äúmust choose unholy‚Äù indicates the deity requires this commitment. ‚ÄúCan choose holy‚Äù or ‚Äúcan choose unholy‚Äù indicates that the deity allows it in addition to many other options. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.158,r=0.903,b=0.263), with ID f75e19a3-1350-4b51-81a9-a89d55cbaa17 -->

**Divine Skill:** Champions and clerics automatically gain the trained proficiency rank in their deity‚Äôs divine skill. Assign the deity one skill that synergizes well with their areas of concern. For example, Intimidation would be appropriate for a god of tyranny, or Deception for a goddess of trickery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.265,r=0.903,b=0.356), with ID 716830e6-cf01-4bc1-af3b-b002371cee90 -->

**Domains:** Each deity grants a number of domains that reflect their divine areas of concern. Champions and clerics can learn the domain spells from their deity‚Äôs domains. Pathfinder‚Äôs deities each have four domains, and many have one or more alternative domains. Though this number is usually enough to convey a deity‚Äôs portfolio and give players sufficient options, you can give your deities as many domains as you like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.358,r=0.903,b=0.478), with ID c32edf68-7e2c-49a1-a27e-dbc059ff845b -->

Favored Weapon: Clerics gain access to their deity‚Äôs
favored weapon as well as the trained proficiency rank
with it; warpriest clerics gain additional benefits. Every
deity has a favored weapon. Because the benefits of
having an advanced favored weapon are very strong,
you should assign simple or martial favored weapons
unless a deity is so thematically linked with an advanced
weapon that you need to give them one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.480,r=0.903,b=0.601), with ID 3b01bad2-af5f-4050-9368-a78da944b979 -->

COSMOLOGY  
An enduring curiosity among many cultures is to ask what wonders lie beyond the night sky. Does anyone gaze back from the moon above? What realms do the gods call home, and what is it like to walk in their divine presence? Is the mortal world at the center of the universe, or is all life utterly insignificant? Spiritual ponderings like these are central to belief systems across the globe. As a world builder, you get to answer those enduring questions by designing the multiverse in all its inexplicable grandeur. The following are some aspects of your cosmology you might consider, but as you decide these, you should also consider how many of these details are known in your world‚Äîand by whom. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.613,r=0.903,b=0.831), with ID affe7ef4-7895-4661-92f7-93d10e77e538 -->

The Universe  
The reality in which mortals live out their short existence is known to sages and scholars by many names‚Äîthe Universe or the mortal realm, among others. The structure of the physical universe might follow any of the following models, or it might be something completely different. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.844,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 0da0a509-f691-49da-8f21-3a8c4ca16f6d -->

Running the Game <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.882,t=0.070,r=0.981,b=0.111), with ID 37170e5b-076e-4b79-950a-e3651fd7174b -->

**Vast:** The universe is an unimaginably sparse void of infinite space, littered with stars, planets, and various bits of detritus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.471,b=0.127), with ID 0e8ec66a-54bc-42b0-84b4-904bcd13fb42 -->

**Limited:** The physical universe in your campaign world may be smaller in scope yet far more fanciful. For example, in Hinduism, the cosmos is supported on the backs of four elephants, themselves standing upon the shell of a world-sized tortoise, whereas Norse cosmology describes nine worlds connected by an immense ash tree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.126,r=0.471,b=0.219), with ID 7b80d916-afde-4923-a774-77a4cc6242c6 -->

**Bizarre:** Sometimes the universe is more complex than the previous two categories, or possibly nested within multiple realities. What if the universe the PCs first know is in fact a magical or mechanical simulation of such complexity that its inhabitants are unaware that they themselves exist as an artificial consciousness? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.219,r=0.471,b=0.312), with ID 5f8ea9eb-aa84-4b1c-89ff-3e0359633647 -->

## Composition of Outer Space
The spaces between the stars can also affect the stories
told in that world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.321,r=0.470,b=0.371), with ID 4862370a-cc45-41e5-bd4b-81dbc21a5afc -->

**Vacuum:** In conventional astronomy, outer space is an immense void existing in a near-perfect vacuum. In some settings‚Äîincluding the Age of Lost Omens, where it is known as the Dark Tapestry‚Äîthe trackless firmament between the stars is an ominous expanse home only to terrible beings of incomprehensible malice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.372,r=0.469,b=0.463), with ID 0bc13326-bfee-4f9b-be60-d6949722b8e0 -->

Celestial Spheres: The ancient Greeks posited that planets, stars, and more were embedded like jewels within celestial orbs of quintessence nested within one another. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.510,r=0.469,b=0.572), with ID b9a7241d-3194-4d60-b35f-83dd8a7f73a2 -->

Solar System  
What is the shape and structure of the solar  
system containing your game world?  
  Heliocentric: Physics dictate that all planets in a  
system orbit the sun. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.581,r=0.467,b=0.663), with ID c07a7005-8af6-4498-b082-5776ebc91034 -->

**Geocentric:** What if your game world is in fact the center of the star system, or perhaps even the center of the known universe? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.663,r=0.470,b=0.709), with ID 43c9e487-3b64-4dd3-a312-cc0e09d10c62 -->

**Dyson Sphere:** Perhaps a solar system has been enclosed in an artificial structure designed to harness the power of the sun. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.709,r=0.445,b=0.757), with ID b219c823-294f-46fd-b09f-7f11bba109e1 -->

## Planets and Moons
In antiquity, astronomers noticed that some of the twinkling lights in the night sky moved differently than the others. In time, these celestial wanderers would come to be known as planets, many with their own complement of orbiting moons. Are there other planets orbiting your world‚Äôs sun? Are they terrestrial, gas giants, or something less common? How many moons are there?

## The Multiverse
In Pathfinder, the physical universe of your world is one plane within a much broader multiverse. The Planes, on page 172, details how planes work and the multiverse of the Age of Lost Omens, but you can fit planes to your story and world, or even build a new multiverse from scratch! Perhaps there are only two planes beyond the material Universe, diametrically opposed and fighting over mortal souls, or the multiverse consists only of a series of infinite alternate realities. The options are truly endless, limited only by your imagination and the story you want to tell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.152,r=0.861,b=0.342), with ID bf560370-e75a-44ea-a4f6-820a41b8b48f -->

Summary : This is a color illustration of a statue of a robed female figure holding a trident and a staff, flanked by two burning braziers, with offerings of food and objects at the base. The scene is rendered in a fantasy art style, likely representing a deity or important figure in a mythological or game context.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Central subject is a stone statue of a woman in a long robe, holding a trident in her left hand and a tall staff in her right.
  ‚Ä¢ The statue stands on a pedestal, with two stone plinths on either side, each supporting a bronze bowl with flames rising from them.
  ‚Ä¢ At the base of the statue are various offerings, including a basket of green apples, a loaf of bread, a purple vegetable (possibly an eggplant), a scroll, and a curved horn.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is white, with some text partially visible along the left edge, suggesting the image is embedded in a book or document.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting is even, with shadows suggesting a light source from above and slightly to the left.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette includes grays for the statue, orange and yellow for the flames, and natural colors for the offerings.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The statue is centrally placed and dominates the composition.
  ‚Ä¢ The burning braziers are symmetrically positioned to the left and right of the statue.
  ‚Ä¢ Offerings are arranged in the foreground, at the base of the statue, creating a sense of ritual or veneration.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image conveys a sense of reverence and ritual, with the statue as the focal point and the offerings and flames enhancing the ceremonial atmosphere.
  ‚Ä¢ The symmetrical arrangement and the presence of offerings suggest the statue represents a figure of worship or importance, possibly a goddess or priestess in a fantasy or mythological setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.442,t=0.339,r=0.867,b=0.957), with ID f9ef31c6-cef5-4725-b301-182dc0ce7a5c -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative UI element with the number "141" displayed prominently, likely as a page or index number, and part of the text "ossary & Index" visible at the top.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject is a stylized rectangular box containing the number "141" in large, bold, red font on a gold background.
  ‚Ä¢ Above the number is a green and gold decorative motif with symmetrical curves and a diamond shape in the center.
  ‚Ä¢ The partial text "ossary & Index" is visible at the top, suggesting this is from a glossary or index section of a document or book.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette is primarily green, gold, and red.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or magnification.
  ‚Ä¢ UI elements include the number "141" and partial header text.
  ‚Ä¢ The number is centered in the lower portion of the image.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The number "141" is in the foreground, with the decorative motif and text above it.
  ‚Ä¢ The composition is vertically stacked: text at the top, motif in the middle, number at the bottom.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image is likely a cropped screenshot from a digital or scanned book, showing a page or section number ("141") in a glossary or index, with decorative elements for visual emphasis. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.918,r=1.000,b=0.985), with ID 634325fe-2262-4f92-b038-55281fb2beea -->

# CHAPTER 3:
## AGE OF LOST OMENS

*Ten thousand years ago, the world of Golarion came close to ending. Earthfall, as this extinction-level event came to be known, saw the world pummeled by a shower of falling stars that sank continents, hollowed out new seas, and destroyed civilizations. It took centuries for the world to recover, and centuries more for society to rebuild, but recover it did.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.073,r=0.867,b=0.207), with ID a1556df3-0edb-4908-a815-bfd2dd8ee76d -->

# HISTORY
Dwarves ascended to the surface from the underground reaches of the Darklands in their legendary Quest for Sky, elves returned from the neighboring planet of Castrovel via a network of portals to reclaim their lands and traditions, and gnomes from the mysterious First World sought shelter for long-forgotten reasons. Survivors from other ancestries who had sheltered through the terror and destruction of Earthfall emerged during the Age of Darkness to reclaim their ancestral lands, from scrappy goblin tribes with a knack for surviving despite all odds against them to industrious halflings who emerged from the ruins to found societies of their own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.226,r=0.473,b=0.434), with ID 0094c4f4-f802-4108-8abe-b6e8c2897131 -->

But humanity made the most astounding recovery.
Less than 2,000 years after the near-extinction from
Earthfall, the Age of Destiny saw the rise of many new
human empires throughout the world. Humanity built
wondrous structures, and its schools relearned magic
that had been thought lost. Among these human nations
walked a man named **Aroden**‚Äîan immortal survivor
of the devastation of Earthfall. Aroden had long since
cultivated a following of loyal subjects who regarded
him with awe, for immortality was but one of the
wonders he‚Äôd achieved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.434,r=0.473,b=0.602), with ID b5f7a587-2efb-416f-b51f-03908bdc8da8 -->

The greatest among these wonders was yet to come.
Aroden discovered a shard of potent magic known today
as the *Starstone*, a fragment from the shooting stars that
fell during Earthfall, which had lodged at the bottom of
the Inner Sea. Contact with this alien artifact assailed
Aroden with phantasmagoric visions, subjected him to
a series of deadly martial trials, and posed exhausting
moral quandaries that challenged his limits more than
any of the arduous experiences he‚Äôd yet endured. He
emerged from this test a living god, and his first divine
act was to raise the *Starstone* and the mass of land on
which it had lain from the bottom of the sea to form the
Isle of Kortos‚Äîalso known as **Starstone Isle**‚Äîwhere he
then established the city of **Absalom**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.602,r=0.473,b=0.817), with ID d20eab6d-b98c-40b2-acb2-fdfd7c06c34a -->

In the centuries to follow, Absalom grew into one of the largest cities in the world, and Aroden‚Äôs legacy grew alongside it. As the millennia passed, his attentions increasingly turned away from the concerns of the Inner Sea‚Äôs inhabitants to otherworldly matters beyond mortal ken, but prophecy spoke of a time when he would return to Golarion and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.817,r=0.463,b=0.941), with ID 26bd308b-0be7-4073-81ac-f8508616d191 -->

lead humanity triumphantly into an Age of Glory. As  
the time of Aroden‚Äôs return drew near, entire nations  
undertook monumental preparations to welcome him  
back to Golarion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.232,r=0.865,b=0.295), with ID 565167eb-24b1-4f11-b35a-ca9cd9c794ca -->

Instead, Aroden died, and with him the reliability of
prophecy as well. Golarion was wracked by storms, war,
and supernatural devastation as the god‚Äôs death marked
the beginning of a new age‚Äîa time of uncertainty, but
also a time of opportunity. This is the **Age of Lost Omens**,
an age in need of heroes like never before. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.295,r=0.867,b=0.389), with ID 9dac13f2-2f0c-42ac-bf6d-9ad3b3b3e011 -->

Summary : This image shows two globes representing hypothetical or reconstructed ancient supercontinents on Earth, viewed from different angles, with landmasses and oceans depicted in color.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subjects are two spherical globes, each showing a different view of the same or similar ancient Earth configuration.
  ‚Ä¢ The globes display large, irregularly shaped landmasses surrounded by blue oceans.
  ‚Ä¢ The left globe shows a prominent landmass extending from the northern to southern hemisphere, with scattered islands.
  ‚Ä¢ The right globe presents a different perspective, highlighting a long, continuous landmass with some desert-like (tan) regions.
  ‚Ä¢ The color palette includes blue (oceans), green and brown (land), and tan (arid or desert areas).

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, text, or annotation is visible.
  ‚Ä¢ The globes are rendered illustrations, not photographs of actual objects.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting is even, with no strong shadows, suggesting a digital or artistic rendering.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ Both globes are centered in the frame, side by side, with the left globe showing one hemisphere and the right globe showing another.
  ‚Ä¢ Landmasses are distributed unevenly, with large contiguous continents and smaller islands.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image visually communicates the arrangement of ancient supercontinents, likely from a period such as the Paleozoic or Mesozoic era.
  ‚Ä¢ The two perspectives help illustrate the global distribution of land and sea at that time, emphasizing the dominance of a few large landmasses.
  ‚Ä¢ The presence of tan regions suggests areas of arid climate or deserts within the supercontinents. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.129,t=0.374,r=0.503,b=0.506), with ID 2de8fb09-bac5-4c5c-a6e9-21749461780d -->

# The Inner Sea Region
Although infinite opportunities for adventure await on other continents, worlds, and planes, the Inner Sea region is the focus of the Pathfinder campaign setting. With dozens of nations, empires, frontiers, and wildlands, this region presents a huge range of opportunities for heroism and villainy, exploration and adventure! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.506,r=0.514,b=0.617), with ID 3ab85519-ac64-4683-9184-fbf21d565b2f -->

Pages 146‚Äì155 break down the Inner Sea region into 10
separate regions, each with its own themes. Only a brief
overview of each region is presented here‚Äîenough to
establish the setting and whet the imagination. If you‚Äôre
interested in exploring Golarion and the Inner Sea region
more, see the Pathfinder Lost Omens, Pathfinder Adventures,
and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes. Adventure Paths
present in-depth material about the region and full-length
campaigns, whose adventures bring a brand-new group of
heroes all the way to the height of power! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.617,r=0.514,b=0.770), with ID e0120cf2-81b4-4157-9822-e0640fe00ffc -->

The year in the Inner Sea region is **4723 Absalom Reckoning (AR)**. As the calendar advances in the real world, time also progresses for Golarion. *Pathfinder Player Core* was first published in the year 2023, with the Inner Sea region‚Äôs corresponding year ending in the same two final digits. Golarion‚Äôs history is expansive, but two of the most significant events to shape the world occurred in **‚Äì5293 AR**, when **Earthfall** nearly brought an end to the world, and in **4606 AR**, when **Aroden**, the god of humanity, died, and prophecies the world over began to fail, beginning the Age of Lost Omens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.771,r=0.514,b=0.939), with ID aee0243f-381e-49a6-a7e8-0d7da86feb9f -->

Summary : This image shows two globes with fictional or stylized continental landmasses, each globe presenting a different view of the same or similar planet, with large green and brown land areas surrounded by blue oceans.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subjects are two spherical globes, each displaying a map of a planet with large, irregularly shaped continents and blue oceans.
  ‚Ä¢ The left globe is oriented to show a large, roughly crescent-shaped continent with peninsulas and bays.
  ‚Ä¢ The right globe is rotated to show a different arrangement of landmasses, with more fragmented continents and numerous islands.
  ‚Ä¢ Both globes are rendered with a soft, painted or digital illustration style, using green for land, brown for highlands or mountains, and blue for water.
  ‚Ä¢ The background is plain white, with no additional context or labels.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, text, or numeric annotations are present.
  ‚Ä¢ No latitude/longitude grid or projection lines are visible.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting is diffuse and even, with no strong shadows.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The two globes are placed side by side, each centered in its half of the image.
  ‚Ä¢ The left globe shows a more consolidated landmass, while the right globe displays a more fragmented, archipelago-like arrangement.
  ‚Ä¢ Both globes are viewed from a slightly oblique angle, giving a three-dimensional appearance.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The image appears to illustrate alternative or fictional planetary geography, possibly for world-building, gaming, or educational purposes.
  ‚Ä¢ The two views highlight different aspects of the same or similar landmasses, emphasizing the diversity of continental shapes and arrangements.
  ‚Ä¢ No real-world geographic features are depicted; the continents do not match Earth's configuration. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.373,r=0.886,b=0.504), with ID 83f6e65c-09ac-4336-84fa-ee24fc32a4a9 -->

The map above depicts the Inner Sea region, further subdivided into the 10 subregions explored on the following pages. The borders of these regions are thematic rather than political.

# Beyond the Inner Sea
The Inner Sea region consists of the continent of Avistan and the northern portion of the continent of Garund, but it‚Äôs only one part of a much larger world. Garund extends further south, and its southern reaches are home to many unexplored civilizations and cultures. As one travels east from the Inner Sea, the vast expanse of the continent of Casmaron stretches beyond the horizon. With the immense inland Castrovin Sea at its heart, Casmaron is the largest of Golarion‚Äôs continents and home to some of its oldest and most successful empires. The Padishah Empire of Kelesh dominates much of western Casmaron, with its satrapy of Qadira reaching into the Inner Sea. To the south of Kelesh lies the peninsula of Vudra, a massive and ancient civilization consisting of over one hundred semi-independent kingdoms. The Hundred and One Ships of Khben-Sald, who was one of Vudra‚Äôs mightiest maharajas, visited Avistan in ancient times and spread the influence of Vudra‚Äôs culture throughout the Inner Sea. On Casmaron‚Äôs southwestern coast lies <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.628,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID 0d767ebd-f613-4aa9-8bda-5dcc4812d384 -->

the island nation of **Iblydos**, a small land hiding titanic prophecies that can transform mere mortals into **hero gods**. Far to the north, to the east of Brevoy, lies the land of Iobara, a crumbling society devastated by plague and other disasters. The east of Casmaron is ruled by the sweeping plains known as the **Grass Sea**, with the horse riders of **Karazh** and the city of **Ular-Kel** being the only steady bastions in the endless wilds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.204), with ID 82e1a3fd-5603-4129-9435-23116481d184 -->

Farther east of Casmaron lies the continent of **Tian Xia**, a region often called the Dragon Empires. The north of Tian Xia connects to Golarion‚Äôs northernmost continent, a frozen reach known as the **Crown of the World**‚Äîthis continent forms a land bridge between Tian Xia and Avistan over the north pole. Though the trade route is frigid and dangerous, immigrants and merchants travel it every year, bringing coveted Tian goods to fill the cups and grace the plates of Taldan tea houses. Bolder explorers sometimes set sail from one continent to another, setting their sights on the trade center of **Goka**, a metropolis that rivals Absalom for the largest city in the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.203,r=0.473,b=0.401), with ID 9ef6fb8b-a41b-41c7-a6f1-d2dc8547f47e -->

South of Tian Xia lies the mysterious continent of **Sarusan**, of which little is known due to the powerful storms and vexing currents that turn away explorers and shroud its shores. Heading west from the Inner Sea region, sailors encounter the shattered remnants of lost **Azlant**, a ruined continent that hosted one of humanity‚Äôs first empires until it was destroyed during Earthfall. Sailing farther west from these ruins eventually leads to the shores of **Arcadia**, a land with unusual magical traditions and powerful nations of its own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.402,r=0.472,b=0.556), with ID b74e2e8a-146e-4a71-b32c-8950f18f5d4f -->

The Darklands  
Beneath all of the surface lands, carved into the planet‚Äôs very crust, lie the twisting tunnels of the tripartite underground realm known collectively as the Darklands, which houses great horrors and dangers but equally great opportunities for triumph and treasure. Deep beneath the surface lies the region known as Nar-Voth, a land of tortuous interconnected cave systems. Dwarves and orcs once lived here, until they moved to the surface after Earthfall‚Äînow it‚Äôs ruled by those who remained and thrive in the dark, such as xulgaths and calignis. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.566,r=0.471,b=0.739), with ID 6dbcf283-2cfe-4814-999a-6ccf517287ef -->

Sekamina, once a seat of power for the Serpentfolk Empire in prehistoric times, is found below Nar-Voth. The caverns here are much larger than any above, some seeming to span entire continents. The ghoul city of Nemret Noktoria can also be found here, deep underneath the surface nations of Osirion and Thuvia. Stranger and awful beings, such as the bizarre seugathi and the nightmarish gogiteth, creep upward from deeper in the Darklands, ensuring the region remains poorly explored. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.740,r=0.471,b=0.877), with ID 40f588dc-7a75-4565-9de5-e958644c523a -->

The deepest layers of the Darklands are known as Orv.

TIME
Like Earth, Golarion spins on its axis once roughly every
24 hours. A week has 7 days, and a year has 52 weeks.
To keep the calendar synchronized with the astronomical
year, an extra leap day is tacked on to the second month
of the year every 4 years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.082,r=0.853,b=0.190), with ID bd9f50ed-dc13-46ac-bb77-5783f69b2c4f -->

# The Solar System
Golarion is but one of 11 worlds that orbit its sun. To the vast majority of the planet‚Äôs denizens, the other worlds are little more than points of light in the sky, but these worlds aren‚Äôt so distant as one might expect. The planets of **Akiton** and **Castrovel** are Golarion‚Äôs closest neighbors. Travelers from both have visited and even settled on Golarion, most notably elves, who originally hail from Castrovel. Even the farthest planet, remote **Aucturn**, has influenced Golarion, with its alien inhabitants exerting a sinister touch on the world that recently put the entire planet in peril. The wise thus don‚Äôt discount the dangers and wonders that dwell on other planets of Golarion‚Äôs solar system. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.553,r=0.861,b=0.755), with ID 7a314951-1349-429e-8340-b3209bb705a2 -->

# The Great Beyond
Countless planets lie beyond Golarion‚Äôs solar system, but even these myriad worlds of the **Universe** are but a fragment compared to what lies in the multiverse beyond. Other planes of existence and strange dimensions wrap this reality in a series of layered, nested spheres, known collectively as the **Great Beyond**. This model of reality is as much a metaphor for concepts that mortal minds have difficulty grasping as a physical description, for within the Great Beyond, anything is possible.

ABSALOM AND THE STARSTONE ISLE <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.145,t=0.535,r=0.898,b=0.576), with ID de20da65-442b-4979-8bba-62d1fd66eaa4 -->

At the heart of the Inner Sea stands the **Isle of Kortos**, raised from the waters thousands of years ago as Aroden‚Äôs first deific act. This amazing feat marked the dawn of the Age of Enthronement and the first year of the Absalom Reckoning calendar. The city of Absalom, the largest in the Inner Sea region, sprawls on the southern shore of this isle. At the city‚Äôs heart stands the legendary **Starstone Cathedral**. Within the walls of this structure, the *Starstone* ever waits to test its next challengers‚Äîand the few mortals who manage to pass this mystic test become gods themselves. It has made Absalom an oft-besieged metropolis, but in its nearly 5,000 years, it has never once fallen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.601,r=0.515,b=0.786), with ID 0f3d6f79-4dda-460e-825c-77bdf29b84cf -->

Absalom, called by many the **City at the Center of the World**, boasts a massive population of disparate peoples, and its culture is a true melting pot in both ancestry and belief. Even the city's architecture reflects this; from the towering and majestic temples of the Ascendant Court to the close-packed shops and guildhalls of the Petal District and the sagging shanties in the Puddles, Absalom's neighborhoods never fail to present a memorable skyline. Many world-reaching organizations were born in Absalom, notably the **Pathfinder Society** (page 165). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.786,r=0.515,b=0.940), with ID 8df46498-662d-4799-a7e8-212d1d13d644 -->

The Isle of Kortos, also known as Starstone Isle, has
a similarly diverse ecosystem. The verdant forests and
grasslands of the west provide many of the resources
Absalom needs, but to the east, the rugged stony desert
known as the Scrape, the dangerous Riven Hills, and the
newly formed necromantic wasteland known as the Tyrant‚Äôs
Grasp present far-harsher climates. The **Isle of Erran**, just
north of Starstone Isle, hosts the area‚Äôs second-largest city,
**Escadar**. A rough seaport with more than its share of shady
dealings, Escadar also hosts large shipyards and maintains
a strong navy that helps to keep the surrounding waters of
the Inner Sea safe. A number of smaller islands also skirt
the coast of the Isle of Kortos‚Äîsome barren, some serving
as hideouts for criminals and outcasts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.602,r=0.905,b=0.816), with ID 5b575429-fc5b-4ded-b3e1-df55383674a4 -->

Rising from the center of the Isle of Kortos are the  
**Kortos Mounts**, a short but rugged range of tors that have  
been ruled by minotaurs, harpies, dragons, and stranger  
beings. A few treacherous passes allow travel through  
the mountains, but with the northern shore of the Isle of  
Kortos being dominated by the soggy tangles of Dunmire,  
these reaches offer little to draw anyone other than bandits  
and adventurers into these still-untamed lands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.816,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID f068221d-a9af-441f-bf97-a3d23153e574 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting a dramatic canyon landscape under a partly cloudy sky, with a large animal skull adorned with red roses in the foreground.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a large, spiked animal skull (possibly a dragon or other fantasy creature) lying on the edge of a canyon.
  ‚Ä¢ The skull is surrounded and partially overgrown by vibrant red roses and green foliage.
  ‚Ä¢ The background features a vast, sunlit canyon with layered rock formations, deep valleys, and a winding river or path at the bottom.
  ‚Ä¢ The sky is filled with dynamic, fluffy clouds, and the lighting suggests midday with strong sunlight and shadows.
  ‚Ä¢ The colour palette is dominated by warm earth tones (browns, oranges) for the canyon, contrasted with the bright reds and greens of the roses and the white of the skull.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  ‚Ä¢ The image is signed "TM '19" in the lower left corner, indicating the artist and year.
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image text or UI elements.

  ‚Ä¢ The canyon stretches into the distance, creating a sense of depth and vastness.
  ‚Ä¢ The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the skull and roses in the lower left, the canyon dominating the middle and right, and the sky filling the upper third.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The juxtaposition of the skull (death) and blooming roses (life) creates a striking visual and thematic contrast.
  ‚Ä¢ The expansive canyon background emphasizes the isolation and grandeur of the setting.
  ‚Ä¢ The image conveys a sense of mystery, fantasy, and the passage of time, with nature reclaiming the remains of a once-mighty creature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.058,r=0.876,b=0.523), with ID 0438c40a-f152-4e1a-842d-35eed9d591f5 -->

BROKEN LANDS <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.314,t=0.535,r=0.643,b=0.573), with ID df6f21db-8fd0-49f1-9b0c-8ce04cc7b79d -->

Far to the north of Absalom sprawl the Broken Lands, nations and wildernesses united in their shared stature as fractured regions‚Äîplaces where life itself has taken a blow and the struggle to survive is simply part of daily reality. Not all of the Broken Lands are constantly fraught with peril, but regardless of where one might settle down in these parts‚Äô tumultuous times, danger is rarely far from home. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.599,r=0.472,b=0.710), with ID 41daee9b-52a3-4bf5-bacb-a4eb1a1a9314 -->

In some cases, the breaks are political. In the northeast,
the nation of Brevoy has hung on the edge of civil war
for many years, as the long-running feud between the
traditional noble houses of Issia and the mercenary
swordlords of Rostland maintain an ongoing state of
tension that might be nearing a breaking point. But in the
case of the oft-contested River Kingdoms, these political
breaks have reached something of a draw, for here it‚Äôs said
that anyone might become the ruler of a nation‚Äîif they
have the tenacity to seize the reins of rule. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.709,r=0.473,b=0.863), with ID e89a8221-9462-4c8e-9f11-53d822424eea -->

Elsewhere in the Broken Lands, the fractures are more
spiritual. **Razmiran**, for example, is ruled by the living
god **Razmir**, who demands the worship of all who dwell
within his nation's borders and brooks no competition
of faith. His priests act as police, brutally enforcing their <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.862,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID 2a7efe1a-8a34-41e5-9b11-601fa0375ee3 -->

deity‚Äôs laws. To the north in **Mendev**, these spiritual breaks
are less obvious; this land struggles to reclaim its heritage
in the wake of a century of occupation by a crusading
force that, until a few years ago, stood as a bulwark
against the demons who ruled the lands to the west. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.601,r=0.863,b=0.678), with ID 3dd2884e-ead0-482b-be28-c5da9fe62e49 -->

These western lands are truly broken, in a physical sense, for in the chaotic times at the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, powerful agents of the demon lord **Deskari** tore a hole in reality. The resulting wound in the landscape allowed legions of demons to pour through and devastate the lands once known as **Sarkoris**. Heroes of the Fifth Crusade recently defeated Deskari and closed the rift, and the ravaged nation is now known as the **Sarkoris Scar**. The main threat has been quelled, but demons still inhabit the region, and the blighted landscape struggles to return to normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.679,r=0.864,b=0.832), with ID 64e2452b-f0e5-40da-bc96-2a90ccf6ba18 -->

Perhaps the strangest of the Broken Lands lie near its
heart. The rugged hills and plains of **Numeria** are home
to many **Kellid** clans. In the distant past, the crash of a
scientifically advanced starship brought strange aliens,
mechanical monstrosities, and technological wonders
to Golarion, but its fiery arrival left large reaches of the
surrounding land blighted and blasted even to this day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.832,r=0.864,b=0.941), with ID 297779cc-8740-4254-9df7-7f05734896ff -->

Summary : This is a dramatic fantasy illustration showing undead creatures, specifically zombies or ghouls, emerging from graves in a moonlit cemetery, with a gothic church in the background. The scene is dark, eerie, and action-filled, evoking horror and supernatural themes.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ Main subject: Several undead creatures, with the most prominent being a decayed, bloodied zombie clawing its way out of the ground in the foreground.
  ‚Ä¢ Setting: A graveyard at night, under a full moon, with leafless trees and a large, gothic-style church in the background.
  ‚Ä¢ Perspective: Low-angle, close-up on the central zombie, with others rising from graves in the midground and background.
  ‚Ä¢ Composition: The central zombie dominates the right foreground, reaching toward the viewer; other zombies are distributed across the scene, creating depth and a sense of encroaching threat.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting: Moonlight casts a cold, blue glow over the scene, with strong highlights and deep shadows; the zombies‚Äô eyes and wounds are accentuated with red, contrasting with the blue tones.
  ‚Ä¢ Colour palette: Predominantly cool blues and greys, with vivid red for blood and glowing eyes.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or measurement references.
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image text except for the "Pathfinder GM Core" branding at the top.
  ‚Ä¢ Artist signature "FELIZ" in the lower left corner.
  ‚Ä¢ Stylised, painterly digital art style.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ Foreground: Central zombie emerging from a grave, reaching out with a bloodied hand.
  ‚Ä¢ Midground: Several other zombies in various stages of emerging from graves, some partially obscured by tombstones and grass.
  ‚Ä¢ Background: Gothic church, bare trees, and a large full moon, establishing the setting and mood.
  ‚Ä¢ Rule-of-thirds: The main zombie‚Äôs face and hand are positioned near the intersection points, drawing the viewer‚Äôs focus.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The illustration conveys a sense of horror and imminent danger, with the undead appearing to rise en masse.
  ‚Ä¢ The use of lighting and colour heightens the supernatural and menacing atmosphere.
  ‚Ä¢ The composition leads the viewer‚Äôs eye from the central figure outward, emphasising the scale of the undead threat and the isolation of the graveyard setting.
  ‚Ä¢ The church in the background adds a gothic, possibly religious undertone, contrasting the sanctity of the place with the profane act of the dead rising. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.007,r=0.997,b=0.522), with ID 05535a2c-b686-42b6-953e-368a6135023d -->

The heart of the continent of Avistan has rotted.

   This region predominantly features **Lake Encarthan**, a large inland sea that was, until recently, a well-traveled trade hub. To the southwest stands the militaristic nation of **Molthune**, long engaged in an intermittent war against its northern neighbor, **Nirmathas**, a wooded nation populated by those who take their freedom seriously. An uprising of hobgoblins took advantage of this conflict, and while hostilities have since abated, the two nations now share their borders with the mountainous hobgoblin nation of **Oprak**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.600,r=0.514,b=0.754), with ID f831b272-6dc4-4bc8-a62f-18fdbb6f0919 -->

North of these war-torn nations lies another land equally
forged in the crucible of conflict. The wild and rugged **Hold
of Belkzen** has long been held by orcs ever since they were
driven up from the Darklands below during the dwarven
**Quest for Sky** thousands of years ago. Still farther to the
north is the nation of **Ustalav**, a collection of counties each
beset with its own manifestation of horror and fear, ranging
from the nightmarishly cosmic to the dreadfully infernal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.755,r=0.514,b=0.878), with ID f88dd717-24d7-43cb-989f-38a8e29cd4f3 -->

It was from Ustalav that one of the greatest threats to the Inner Sea region emerged. The ancient lich **Tar-Baphon**, known as the **Whispering Tyrant**, has been defeated twice in the distant past‚Äîonce by **Aroden** and once by the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.878,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID aaed9ed4-908a-42a1-910f-e0f247fdd4ce -->

heroes of the **Shining Crusade**‚Äîbut he has never been
truly destroyed. When the magical seals that kept him
imprisoned below the ominous tower of Gallowspire
were finally sundered in 4719 AR, Tar-Baphon emerged.
The nation of **Lastwall**, which bore the brunt of his return
to the world, has been utterly scoured by the destruction
he wrought. Lastwall once stood as a small but strong
nation of champions and protectors, holding fast against
invasions from orcs, undead, and other threats. Now it
exists only as the **Gravelands**, the nation that once stood
watch over undead uprisings consigned to an undeath of its
own. While heroes temporarily thwarted the Whispering
Tyrant‚Äôs immediate plans shortly after he emerged, the lich
remains an active menace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.602,r=0.905,b=0.816), with ID e762af21-6205-4fcf-8b23-120637526038 -->

The Whispering Tyrant now rules a kingdom of the undead on the aptly named Isle of Terror in the center of Lake Encarthan. The nations lining Lake Encarthan‚Äôs shores have all suffered to varying degrees under the Whispering Tyrant‚Äôs renewed influence, and some are pursuing unlikely alliances to resist him. The lich is gathering his resources on the Isle of Terror, and none can say where or when he‚Äôll strike next. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.817,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID cc965403-0616-4faf-a4d9-dba8e60b8d88 -->

Trade and travel rule the pathways of the Golden Road, known for its shining sands and economic strength. Much of this region consists of sprawling desert, but this doesn‚Äôt mean that the area is sparse in population. Coastlines and rivers are the lifeblood of this region, and caravans brave the heat and dangers of well-trodden routes to trade across northern **Garund**. Some of the Inner Sea‚Äôs oldest nations command this area, and ancient lore and valuable treasures can be found amid its shifting sands and storied cities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.599,r=0.472,b=0.739), with ID 6bbdd2cc-850a-47f6-b7b6-5db41ede7c82 -->

The largest city in the region is the cosmopolitan **Katapesh**, where mercantilism is overseen by a strange group known as the **Pactmasters**. Much of the trade in Katapesh is in goods that can be freely exchanged throughout the Inner Sea region, but the city does just as much business in avenues normally relegated to the black markets of other societies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.740,r=0.471,b=0.832), with ID 2158aac5-b1c0-4b7d-9b13-645b9a2819ff -->

To the west, the five city-states of *Thuvia* tinker with the
lost technology of fallen empires, but they‚Äôre most visited
by those seeking a legendary alchemical concoction called
the **sun orchid elixir**, which grants renewed youth to those
who consume it. This treasured commodity is the keystone
of Thuvia‚Äôs place in the Golden Road. Further west, the
nation of **Rahadoum is** perhaps the weakest mercantile

of gods to place its faith in the industry and talent of
mortals alone gives the nation its own compelling draw. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.633,r=0.863,b=0.785), with ID 99d576b4-1874-433f-9df9-c0d5d94d9cee -->

At the center of the Golden Road lies mighty Osirion, one
of the oldest nations of the Inner Sea. While Osirion was
for a time ruled by Qadira, the legacies and monuments of
its early days still stand tall as an indisputable source of
pride and identity to its people. The influence of Osirion‚Äôs
artisans, philosophers, and spellcasters has spread far and
wide, particularly via the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye
and the faith of Nethys, whose not-so-humble beginnings
as a mortal wizard can be traced to the very beginning of
Osirion‚Äôs history during the ancient Age of Destiny. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.786,r=0.862,b=0.939), with ID 389792d3-6b62-43e3-bc25-61c6adcb8806 -->

HIGH SEAS <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.407,t=0.538,r=0.638,b=0.574), with ID e9269be7-3c55-45e1-8353-a23546e7f04e -->

From pirate fleets united under the **Hurricane Queen of the Shackles** to an ancient, subaquatic empire of shape-changing monsters led by the sinister veiled masters, the High Seas of Golarion present dangers both above and below the waves. Yet, they also serve as important trade routes, with merchant ships traveling the waters between powerful nations at opposite ends of continents. Sea captains brave the dangers of the High Seas hoping to partake in the fortunes to be made in trade, linking the ports of the Inner Sea to those on the shores of the **Arcadian Ocean**, from the **Mwangi Expanse** to the **Saga Lands**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.600,r=0.515,b=0.770), with ID 02d13839-e698-4b88-b2f0-26fb8bb16185 -->

Piracy is one of the greatest dangers facing travelers on the High Seas. The immense volcanic archipelago known as the Shackles serves as a haven for these pirates, with their Hurricane Queen providing just enough structure to keep them from going at each other's throats. A great diversity of monsters and threats populate these islands, and the local pirates know which are safe and which to avoid. North of the Shackles lies **Mediogalti Island**. While its only significant port, **Ilizmagorti**, is a known safe harbor for pirates, it's the presence of the infamous **Red Mantis assassins** who rule the isle that gives this region its greatest infamy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.770,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID 7842eab0-9863-4935-855b-ea0e9eaf2343 -->

Other ports present their own complications. The city of  
Promise on the remote isle of Hermea, a few hundred miles  
west of Avistan, rewards well those who can negotiate the  
privilege of trade, but such honors are hard won, for this  
closed society doesn‚Äôt allow just anyone to visit. However,  
new stories from this strange island nation claim that a  
recent tumult might break the tradition of isolation (and  
some say oppression) of this dragon-led nation. Farther to  
the north, the elves of the Mordant Spire are even more  
closed to visitors, and for most sailors, the only thing the  
Mordant Spire offers is an unmistakable landmark for  
navigation, as the twisting spire can be seen for miles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.602,r=0.905,b=0.785), with ID d1e0a0ad-5a7c-43b1-bf93-4c67615ab06d -->

Of all the regions along the Avistani and Garundi
coastlines, none are more hazardous to travel than the waters
tortured by the **Eye of Abendego**. This immense hurricane
first formed at the onset of the Age of Lost Omens, when
storms wracked all of Golarion in the wake of Aroden‚Äôs
death. This hurricane, however, remained permanently.
Its winds and storm surge have destroyed several nations
and transformed a previously key gulf into a navigational
nightmare. What strange force caused and perpetuates the
Eye of Abendego has, to date, eluded all investigation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.786,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID de31ff43-3f67-4e9c-a08a-dc20ae362b92 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting a fantastical palace with architectural features reminiscent of the Taj Mahal, set atop a misty hill surrounded by tropical vegetation and water, with several floating, glowing blue towers or capsules hovering around the structure.

photo:  
Scene Overview :  
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a large, ornate palace with domes and minarets, rendered in cool blue tones, evoking the style of the Taj Mahal.  
  ‚Ä¢ The palace is situated on a raised, rocky hill, surrounded by lush, tropical vegetation including palm trees.  
  ‚Ä¢ The foreground features a reflective body of water, with mist or fog at the base of the hill.  
  ‚Ä¢ The sky is overcast with a gradient from pale yellow near the horizon to greyish-blue higher up, suggesting dawn or dusk.  
  ‚Ä¢ Several tall, glowing blue capsules or towers are floating in the air around the palace, adding a science-fiction or fantasy element.  
  ‚Ä¢ The overall colour palette is dominated by cool blues and greens, with some warm yellow at the horizon.

Technical Details :  
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.  
  ‚Ä¢ The image is a digital illustration, not a photograph.  
  ‚Ä¢ No on-image text or UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :  
  ‚Ä¢ The palace is centrally placed in the background, framed by palm trees on both sides in the foreground.  
  ‚Ä¢ The floating capsules are distributed around the palace, some in front and some behind, creating depth.  
  ‚Ä¢ The water and mist in the foreground lead the viewer‚Äôs eye toward the palace.

Analysis :  
  ‚Ä¢ The image combines elements of South Asian architecture with futuristic or magical motifs (floating capsules), creating a sense of wonder and otherworldliness.  
  ‚Ä¢ The composition uses framing and atmospheric perspective to draw attention to the palace, while the mist and lighting enhance the mystical mood.  
  ‚Ä¢ The juxtaposition of natural tropical elements with the fantastical palace and floating structures suggests a blending of genres or worlds. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.061,r=0.875,b=0.521), with ID 619de687-f35c-4b7f-9759-8e630b33f2ba -->

Magic allows for astounding feats, yet even those who
consider themselves experts in the magical arts pause in
wonder before the spectacles to be found in the Impossible
Lands. What‚Äôs taken for granted in these strange and
eclectic nations would be all but impossible elsewhere. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.600,r=0.473,b=0.678), with ID d47036f1-1d51-40c3-b038-527ad64247a6 -->

Take **Geb** as an example. Here, the living are the minority,
supplanted by undeath. Cruelty, sadism, and violence are
the norm, as one might expect of a land ruled by a violent,
undead dictator. This ghost, for whom the country was
named, has ruled his nation for millennia, although for the
past several centuries, the day-to-day rule of the land fell to
his queen, **Arazni**. Her recent disappearance (many would
instead say ‚Äúescape‚Äù) left the government in disarray until
rumors from the north invigorated the ghost sovereign to
again take active leadership of his benighted realm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.679,r=0.472,b=0.832), with ID 35291d75-89b9-467b-b6dc-d620974397f7 -->

Geb has opposed its northern neighbor, **Nex**, for the entirety of its existence. Also named after its founder, the nation of Nex is a cosmopolitan realm where magic is mundane. The wizard Nex has been missing for ages, yet in his absence, the **Arclords** have ruled quite effectively. Here, powerful constructs patrol the streets, and the practice of **fleshforging** is an accepted and legitimate industry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.833,r=0.472,b=0.940), with ID 44ef0345-72f6-432e-b787-1defecb5bd2d -->

Between these two opposed nations lies a stretch of land
known as the Mana Wastes, a blasted and blighted badland
formed by the ancient wars between Nex and Geb. The
very magic of these lands is warped beyond control‚Äîor
in many reaches dead entirely‚Äîand peculiar mutants flop
and prowl through storms of blood in search of prey. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.602,r=0.863,b=0.694), with ID b82a156f-72de-409d-908c-98cc2fbb2163 -->

Only in the duchy of Alkenstar does life approach anything near normal, but even here, the assumptions of the rest of the world are turned on their head. With magic being unpredictable, Alkenstar‚Äôs citizens have turned instead to technology. The nation is home to metallurgists and machinists, and the art of gunsmithing gives them an excellent advantage in this part of the world. Exports of firearms have steadily increased over the years, and Alkenstar is emerging as a significant power of its own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.694,r=0.862,b=0.831), with ID bf5285ac-f446-40f7-86c8-a7f5109d44b3 -->

Across the eastern waters of the **Obari Ocean** lies the final realm of the Impossible Lands: the island nation of **Jalmeray**. Here, it isn‚Äôt just magic that allows for impossibilities, but also focused training and practices of self-perfection. The people of Jalmeray have accomplished astounding physical feats and achieved remarkable intellectual insights through these long-honed methods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.832,r=0.861,b=0.939), with ID ce7b5e62-eb9b-41f7-94cf-4076f6ae9cf0 -->

The Mwangi Expanse is home to a wide array of
civilizations, both past and present, even as it holds the
largest stretch of wilderness in the Inner Sea region. In fact,
one of the first civilizations to rise from the ashes after
Earthfall did so in this land‚Äîthe nation of Shory and its
flying cities, which spurred many modern schools of magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.600,r=0.515,b=0.694), with ID 899a4253-534c-408e-8d1b-4a5edca09046 -->

Some Mwangi cities and kingdoms were lost far more
recently than those ancient wonders. When the **Eye of
Abendego** formed just over a century ago, its winds and
waves flooded two significant realms along Garund‚Äôs west
coast. Where once stood the nations of **Lirgen** and **Yamasa**
now stretch only the **Sodden Lands**, a swath of swampland
and salt marshes held by rival gangs of scavengers and
monsters. Even more recently, the powerful city-state of <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.694,r=0.513,b=0.821), with ID 241dafa6-6fb6-4506-9937-bc64520bdff2 -->

Usaro fell into chaos when its brutal leader, **Ruthazek the Gorilla King**, was slain by adventurers. In only a few short years, the power vacuum has caused significant damage as disparate factions feud among themselves. A long lineage of demonically infused Gorilla Kings has ruled Usaro over the centuries, and so a new one will likely soon rise to seize control of Usaro, but for the moment, this sinister region lacks a head to focus its wrath. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.818,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID e538b6e1-7af9-42d1-b7d3-6558bfc89153 -->

Despite these instances of ruin, the Mwangi Expanse
hosts a wealth of diverse and powerful city-states within
its reaches. In **Bloodcove**, the ruthless mercantile league
of the **Aspis Consortium** vies against the **Free Captains of
the Shackles** for economic power. Farther south along the
coast stands **Senghor**, whose stance against both piracy
and exploitative trade place the city in stark contrast
to its northern neighbor. The city-state of **Nantambu**
lies far upstream, where its citizens carry on the ancient
traditions of **Old-Mage Jatembe** in combining arcane and
primal magic. Far to the southeast stands **Mzali** under the
oppressive rule of the mummy child-king **Walkena**, though
a group of dissidents called the **Bright Lions** work to resist
his reign. Then, there‚Äôs the trade city of **Kibwe**, where
within its walls dwell an eclectic mix of people who are
overseen by the mysterious and ancient **Pillar-Watchers**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.603,r=0.905,b=0.846), with ID 273ac6db-f4c6-4d19-8084-4e2674a361c8 -->

Farther south lies the recently freed nation of **Vidrian**. Originally the Chelaxian colony of **Sargava**, Vidrian has now seized its own destiny and cast off its colonial shackles. In so doing, the young nation has exposed itself to the predations of pirates and worse, yet to its citizens, freedom from oppression is well worth that price. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.847,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID f4a529b3-3e23-49f1-a8c3-fc3b8fb7e23b -->
