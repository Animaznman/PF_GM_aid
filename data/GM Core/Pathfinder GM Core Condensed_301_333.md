SHOT OF THE FIRST VAULT                                            ITEM 23

RARE  ARTIFACT  DIVINE

Ammunition any
Legends claim that some long-forgotten god stole the original bundle of shots of the First Vault from Abadar’s repository. Since then, individual pieces have turned up throughout the multiverse. When you pick up a shot of the First Vault, it immediately reshapes itself to function with any ranged weapon and establishes you as its owner until another creature picks it up. As its owner, you can use the shot’s single-action activation after shooting it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.535,r=0.472,b=0.708), with ID 4d038e29-9007-4790-aec2-4424dbeddbd3 -->

Instead of rolling weapon damage dice, a shot of the First Vault deals 25 damage plus any bonuses or additional damage as if 25 were the result of the weapon’s damage dice; the damage type matches that normally dealt by the weapon. Upon damaging a creature, the shot of the First Vault shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments remain lodged in the creatures they damage; the creatures are clumsy 2 while the fragments remain in place. A total of 3 Interact actions are required to remove the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature; alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30 Medicine check can be used. A critical failure on this Medicine check deals 10 persistent bleed damage to the creature with the embedded fragment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.709,r=0.472,b=0.940), with ID d3e10ab5-c0e3-4210-bdfd-382ce03020dd -->

Activate—Reload Order ![inline micro-figure: black diamond with white question mark] (concentrate) Effect You recall the shot of the First Vault, which automatically reloads itself into your weapon. If the shot had fragmented, the fragments violently dislodge themselves, dealing 15 persistent bleed damage to each creature in which they were embedded. The fragments then unite to re-form the shot of the First Vault, which automatically reloads itself into your weapon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.462,r=0.863,b=0.586), with ID eb3bb652-4ff7-45fb-9032-ffaabdc40231 -->

# INTELLIGENT ITEMS

*Magic items with a mind of their own have been a hallmark of myth and fantasy for millennia. When integrated into a campaign, they can become memorable characters in their own right.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.079,r=0.906,b=0.165), with ID a8348542-1cd3-4c26-b635-a6a2d96e9ce5 -->

Intelligent items are a special kind of magic item that
straddles the line between treasure and NPC. An
intelligent item might be another type of item as well: it
could be an artifact (like Serithtial on page 302), a cursed
item (page 306), or even a relic (page 308) that grows
with its wielder. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.202,r=0.513,b=0.295), with ID 84391b73-ea15-4fa3-92fd-17735ed773bd -->

Introducing an intelligent item is an effective way to subtly alter the party dynamic. An intelligent item works well when its personality makes it a natural complement or foil for its partner: the PC investing, holding, or otherwise interacting with the item. An intelligent item that can communicate only with that particular PC is also a great way to engage players who are a bit quieter, or those slower to speak in a scene where all the PCs can talk to a particular NPC. Due to their inherently limited agency, intelligent items are at less of a risk for stealing the spotlight than other NPCs who travel along with the party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.296,r=0.507,b=0.496), with ID 58f8d5a2-8bea-49c6-9d69-2742e92c1565 -->

# Intelligent Item Rules
Every intelligent item has the intelligent trait. Intelligent items can’t be crafted by normal means—typically an accident, a divine act, or a major sacrifice on the part of the creator is required to grant the item the mental essence it needs for sentience, and in some rare cases the spiritual essence it needs to have a soul of its own. Because of this, intelligent items are always rare or unique. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or using an item of its type still apply to an intelligent item. In addition, intelligent items have a few statistics other items lack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.506,r=0.505,b=0.694), with ID 4463f09c-b7c0-43c5-b82c-efdef61e0c27 -->

Perception and Senses  
An intelligent item that has any sense of the world around them has a Perception modifier. Intelligent items have only the senses listed within their entry, rather than the assumed assortment of senses that most creatures have. If an intelligent item notices something its partner doesn’t, it might be able to communicate with its partner and let them know. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.705,r=0.511,b=0.832), with ID 68aafcd4-e77d-471a-9c30-5660fbcbd553 -->

## Communication and Languages
Intelligent items almost always have some means of communication—an easy way to demonstrate an item’s intelligence! The most common ways are via empathy, speech, and telepathy. Speech and telepathy function as they do for any creature, while an empathic connection <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.844,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 493a9620-4a24-47f3-9a72-08dd99460945 -->

allows the item to share only emotions. Empathic and
telepathic connections are often limited either to the
item’s partner or to a certain distance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.204,r=0.903,b=0.249), with ID c48176c3-cc7d-44c2-ac55-aa56a2c40fe3 -->

If an intelligent item understands or speaks any languages, they are listed in parentheses in its Communication entry. If the item doesn’t have speech listed, it can only understand the listed languages, not speak them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.249,r=0.902,b=0.311), with ID 8ae388c7-61bb-4da1-9b54-ab647f3c78b7 -->

Skills
Intelligent items might have skill modifiers for
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skills
that fit their nature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.580,t=0.322,r=0.903,b=0.388), with ID eeccda49-49ff-49c7-85c9-f2ed2ed184d7 -->

Attribute Modifiers  
Intelligent items have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers, though as inanimate objects, they don’t have Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution entries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.538,t=0.400,r=0.903,b=0.465), with ID aa6f7f61-4cfa-4499-be75-5a8935fc26ec -->

**Will Save**  
Since they have their own minds, intelligent items might be subject to mental effects that require a Will save. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.538,t=0.476,r=0.902,b=0.526), with ID 0a37c9b6-aa5c-4c4e-89c8-28086199cbd3 -->

## Item Agency
As a default, intelligent items have control over all their own magic, meaning an intelligent magic weapon could deny the effects of its fundamental and property runes if it so chose, and intelligent items perform their own activations when they wish. Intelligent items can typically use 3 actions per turn, acting on their partner’s turn. These actions don’t count toward their partner’s 3 actions. They have a reaction if any of their activations requires one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.535,t=0.538,r=0.903,b=0.692), with ID 58bf65d8-37a5-472c-b263-ea6b8e9d9d55 -->

Beyond denying magic effects and communicating
their displeasure, intelligent items can usually influence
or hinder their partners only in subtle ways. If the item is
a weapon or tool necessary for an action (like a thieves’
toolkit), it can at least be disruptive enough to make
its partner take a –2 circumstance penalty to associated
checks, much as if the partner were using an improvised
weapon or tool. If an intelligent item can have a greater
effect, such as seizing control of its partner’s body for a
time, the intelligent item’s entry includes those abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.695,r=0.902,b=0.846), with ID 2f6fccd2-c9df-4ea7-a54e-c8b98adeddae -->

# DESIGNING INTELLIGENT ITEMS
When you first set out to create an intelligent item, ask yourself what role you expect the item will play in your game. Unlike any other item, the intelligent item is a character of its own and adds to the group dynamic, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.860,r=0.902,b=0.939), with ID 790251b7-08a2-4784-b357-8fdc5e6af9e5 -->

Summary : The image displays a large, bold numeral "5" centered on a textured, brownish-gold background, with the number rendered in a dark brown color and outlined in a lighter shade for contrast.

logo: 
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, sans-serif font.
  • The number is centered on a mottled, brownish-gold background.
  • The "5" is dark brown with a lighter outline, enhancing visibility.
Technical Details : 
  • No company name, tagline, or additional text is present.
  • No scale bar, UI elements, or other markings.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The number "5" is centrally placed, dominating the image.
  • No foreground or background elements other than the textured backdrop.

Analysis : 
  • The design draws attention to the number "5" as the sole focus, possibly for use as a label, marker, or decorative element. The color contrast ensures high visibility against the background. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.883,t=0.007,r=0.996,b=0.059), with ID 49d585f5-e4ec-4082-97d9-02f16c151350 -->

usually in ways similar to a minor NPC who follows
the party throughout the adventure. That means it’s
important to have a clear role in mind. Is the item an
ally in the PCs’ dangerous quest? A kindred spirit and
confidante? A foil for the PC? A morally ambiguous ally
worth handling for its great power? Or perhaps a bit of
comic relief? Once you know what you want in the item,
you can develop its personality and abilities in parallel,
coming up with thematic links between them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.079,r=0.472,b=0.218), with ID bc589f62-a39e-4a90-b58a-a4c99df18b85 -->

When choosing values for the intelligent item’s statistics, you’ll often want to use values suitable for a creature of its level. You could use much lower values if you want to give it a weakness, but keep in mind that a low Will modifier might make it particularly easy to control, which could be a problem if it can make life miserable for its partner. Because the item can usually activate its abilities on its own, the intelligent item is essentially adding a limited additional character to the PCs’ team, so consider its effect on the encounters the PCs face. For example, a high-level normal item that lets a PC cast a 3rd-rank fireball every round might be reasonable given that it counts toward the PC’s available actions, but an intelligent item is adding that fireball on top of everything else the PCs can do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.219,r=0.472,b=0.450), with ID 686ff467-0ead-4d91-8353-68e77d13a042 -->

The genius diadem is a crown of intellect that typically acts like an arrogant professor or mentor, often boasting that it is a certified greater intellect and far superior to your own intelligence, even after the benefits the diadem grants you. The genius diadem encourages you to learn things for yourself rather than actually attempting to Recall Knowledge for you, though you or your allies might be able to play on its arrogance using Deception to trick it into doing so. In addition to allowing you to activate it, the diadem can use the Search Your Mind activation with its own actions, though if it does so, the diadem gains the benefits instead of you.

A martyr’s shield is a lesser sturdy shield imbued with the compassion of a devout champion of a righteous deity, like Iomedae or Vildeis, who sacrificed themself to save an ally. In addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its religion, the martyr’s shield can use 1 reaction each round that, when raised, it uses to Shield Block to protect an ally adjacent to you. This follows the rules for Shield Block, but protects your ally instead. The martyr’s shield uses this reaction whether you would prefer it did so or not. The martyr’s shield can be upgraded to a stronger form of sturdy shield by paying the difference in cost between its current type of sturdy shield and the new type. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.158,r=0.860,b=0.400), with ID f2725fc7-8b2e-43b4-8b1b-59775b117f4a -->

Will +13 (+17 against attempts to quiet its singing)
A singing sword is a +1 striking longsword imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A singing sword can’t stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful Diplomacy or Intimidation check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly. The singing sword can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a dancing weapon’s activation, except that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for compositions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.557,r=0.861,b=0.785), with ID 368f685f-8497-4485-8890-00cb03119c92 -->

Summary : This image shows a stylized emblem or badge with a number, likely representing a score, currency, or resource in a game interface.

logo: 
  Scene Overview : 
    • Central diamond shape outlined in gold, flanked by two symmetrical abstract human-like figures with raised arms, all on a dark green and brown background.
    • Below the emblem, a rectangular label with a gold background and green border contains the number “305” in large, bold, dark red font.
  Technical Details : 
    • No visible company name, tagline, or additional text.
    • The emblem is centered at the top, with the number label directly beneath.
    • No scale bar or units present.
  Spatial Relationships : 
    • Emblem occupies the upper half; number label is horizontally aligned below.
    • Symmetry in the emblem’s design, with mirrored figures on each side of the diamond.
  Analysis : 
    • The design suggests a fantasy or medieval theme, possibly indicating a resource or achievement count in a game interface. The use of gold and green may imply value or prestige. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.898,t=0.922,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID 07667a26-b137-4654-ac9f-632f12f5e68a -->

# CURSED ITEMS

*While magical items can be potent weapons in any adventurer’s arsenal, magic can be unpredictable and is not always benign. Cursed items are unusual magical creations that have a malicious effect on the unwary and can force its wielders into difficult choices.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.079,r=0.908,b=0.168), with ID 3975549f-90ff-4908-8033-d578a35d608e -->

Cursed items are almost never made intentionally; even those who set out to curse an item find the task incredibly difficult or even impossible. These items are the results of magical mishaps, shoddy crafting, or sinister forces interfering with the creation. Many specify how their curses work, but curses are fickle, and you as the GM determine how curses play out in your game. Due to these factors, an item with the cursed trait is always rare. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.203,r=0.515,b=0.325), with ID d44fe725-25b3-48a6-96a9-b6c6e674dde4 -->

**Identifying Cursed Items:** Cursed items often appear to be ordinary magical items, as the magic that warps their function also disguises their curses from detection. Unless you roll a critical success when attempting to Identify Magic on a cursed item, it simply appears as something helpful or benign. A critical success reveals both the presence of the curse and the exact nature of the curse. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.327,r=0.515,b=0.433), with ID 1654e384-51f1-45cf-9329-4d789420c7c0 -->

**Removing Cursed Items:** Many cursed items can’t be discarded. Some use magic to fuse to the wielder, making it impossible to remove the item, while others attune to their owner and return even if discarded. (This section uses the term “fuse” to describe either situation.) In many cases, this feature reveals itself only after the cursed item has been triggered for the first time or after investing the item for the first time, allowing the user to develop a false sense of security. Fused cursed items can be removed by targeting the item’s owner with a *cleanse affliction* spell or similar magic. If the spell is successful, the item can be discarded, but nothing prevents the item from cursing the same creature again if the conditions are met, so it’s best to dispose of the item quickly. Invested cursed items that can’t be removed continue to count against a character’s invested items, even without reinvesting them each day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.434,r=0.514,b=0.679), with ID b44dc5ba-c444-4a19-b78a-e1cd08241220 -->

SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS  
The following are a few examples of cursed items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.689,r=0.476,b=0.724), with ID 01254d99-453c-4ad2-afee-531c75539da6 -->

BAG OF WEASELS                                                                 ITEM 4
RARE  CURSED  EXTRADIMENSIONAL  MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This item appears to be and functions as a type I spacious pouch, until you try to retrieve an item from the bag. Whenever you retrieve an item from the bag of weasels, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, you retrieve the item as normal. On a failure, the item you retrieve is transformed into a weasel; this doesn’t affect artifacts, cursed items, or other hard-to-destroy items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.735,r=0.514,b=0.877), with ID fadd091d-5000-4bbb-8d36-e101b27b4c6c -->

This weasel uses either the weasel statistics (*Bestiary 3* 291) or a giant rat statistics (*Monster Core*) and exudes an aura of magic. The weasel has no loyalty to you and typically attempts to escape as quickly as possible. If the weasel is counteracted, it transforms <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.877,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 5fd4c33b-6a13-49fe-8508-102f6a7a54dd -->

back into the original item that was taken from the *bag of
weasels*. If it dies or is slain, the weasel disappears and the item
is permanently destroyed. Because the weasel is a transformed
item, you don't gain any benefit you would receive from attacking
a creature, defeating one, damaging one, or the like, but you do
gain any benefit you would gain from destroying an item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.202,r=0.904,b=0.297), with ID e56bea2e-f9a2-48db-9686-f7193eb13699 -->

CLOAK OF IMMOLATION                                            ITEM 7
RARE  CURSED  INVESTED  MAGICAL
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
Appearing as a magic cloak such as a clandestine cloak, this
garment is made of highly volatile fabric. While wearing it,
if you take fire damage, you also take 1d10 persistent fire
damage. Taking fire damage while the persistent fire damage
is in effect has no additional effect. You can extinguish the
persistent fire damage as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.306,r=0.905,b=0.448), with ID 86ef60c5-59f7-481f-a1ac-d89f801ba4d0 -->

Any creature that hits you with a melee unarmed attack while you are taking this persistent fire damage takes fire damage equal to the persistent fire damage you took on your previous turn. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.449,r=0.904,b=0.525), with ID 1fd3bad3-3b7f-44a2-95a9-2346b1bee0a0 -->

MEDUSA ARMOR                                            ITEM 14
RARE  CURSED  INVESTED  MAGICAL
Usage worn armor; Bulk 3
This +2 adamantine scale mail appears to have a fortification rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become petrified for 1 round. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.536,r=0.904,b=0.663), with ID 320bc1b6-9d72-46ef-9352-41694d556200 -->

MONKEY’S PAW                                            ITEM 20

RARE  CURSED  MAGICAL  MISFORTUNE
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This dried, gnarled hand is clenched in a fist, waiting for a creature to pick it up. When you pick up the monkey’s paw, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The monkey’s paw grants you three wishes (with the effects of a success on the wish ritual), curling one finger after every one. Once you pick up the monkey’s paw, you cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist by granting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the hand, even with the effects of a wish ritual, are unsuccessful as the monkey’s paw reappears among your possessions within 1d4 hours; it doesn’t work for any other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make all three wishes, the monkey’s paw uses interplanar teleport to travel to a random point in the multiverse. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.674,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 65254d85-3541-46e6-8412-6b9b7b8555aa -->

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "5" is centrally placed, with even spacing around it.
  • No foreground or background elements other than the textured tan field.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended as a simple, bold visual marker or logo featuring the number "5", with high contrast for visibility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.906,t=0.014,r=0.971,b=0.056), with ID 2687d0ed-d77a-4eec-aefa-57eda3d69f90 -->

Summary : This is a humorous illustration showing a brown leather backpack with a weasel peeking out of the top, accompanied by the caption "BAG OF WEASELS".

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is a brown leather backpack, rendered in a realistic style, positioned slightly angled to the right.
  • A small, alert weasel is emerging from the open top flap of the backpack, looking outward.
  • The background is a plain, light beige color, with no additional objects or scenery.
  • The phrase "BAG OF WEASELS" appears in bold, dark brown text to the right of the backpack.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • The image is well-lit with soft, even lighting and no visible shadows.
  • The text is in all capital letters, sans-serif font, and aligned horizontally.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The backpack occupies the left-central portion of the image, with the weasel emerging from the top, drawing attention to the upper left.
  • The text is placed to the right of the backpack, balancing the composition.

Analysis : 
  • The image is intended as a visual pun on the phrase "bag of weasels," combining literal and figurative elements for comedic effect. The clear, simple composition and neutral background focus attention on the backpack and the animal, enhancing the humor. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.035,t=0.062,r=0.518,b=0.268), with ID 51f1135c-c99d-4858-a90c-523bfd0e78b3 -->

Summary : This is an illustration of a desiccated monkey's paw suspended by a string, accompanied by the label "MONKEY'S PAW".

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a shriveled, dark, and hairy monkey's paw, depicted in a realistic style.
  • The paw is shown hanging downward, tied at the wrist with a cord or string.
  • The background is a plain, light beige color, providing high contrast with the subject.
  • The text "MONKEY'S PAW" appears in bold, uppercase letters to the right of the paw.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or reference object is present to indicate size.
  • The illustration uses muted, naturalistic colors (greys, browns, and blacks) for the paw.
  • The string is rendered in a simple, unadorned style.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The paw is positioned diagonally from the upper right to the lower left, occupying the left half of the image.
  • The text is placed to the right of the paw, horizontally aligned with the middle of the paw.

Analysis :
  • The image visually references the famous supernatural object from literature, "The Monkey's Paw," emphasizing its eerie and unsettling appearance through detailed rendering and stark composition. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.061,r=0.867,b=0.264), with ID 46391c9e-cb74-485f-9318-b86df1079b48 -->

Whenever the monkey’s paw hears you utter a statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don’t use the words “I wish,” it activates and grants a twisted, horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within the possibility of *wish* ritual, and potentially a greater effect at the GM’s discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.290,r=0.472,b=0.376), with ID 8b12868f-51f9-451f-8a05-e7ae7b4ce243 -->

Item Curses
Item curses alter their base item, much like a property rune. A curse can be applied to the specific types of magic items listed in its Usage entry. Curses typically can’t be removed or transferred from the item, though at your discretion, either might be possible after the curse is broken. If the PCs manage to break the curse, the newly uncursed item could be quite valuable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.382,r=0.472,b=0.512), with ID e8d30485-56db-447f-b821-d67bff17560c -->

ARSONOUS CURSE 7

RARE CURSED FIRE MAGICAL

Usage curses a ring, staff, or wand
An arsonous curse creates flaws in the mystic pathways that channel magic through an item, allowing excess power to escape as sparks. Whenever you activate the magic item, a random ally within 30 feet takes 1d10 persistent fire damage. If no ally is in range, you take the damage instead. At the GM’s discretion, this curse might ignite an unattended object or the surrounding environment instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.518,r=0.473,b=0.680), with ID 11065dcc-b8a1-4746-808a-2951c75f235b -->

BLOODBITER CURSE 6

RARE CURSED MAGICAL

Usage curses a piercing or slashing weapon  
A bloodbiter weapon is awakened by violence and fueled by blood. When you make a successful attack with the weapon, it inflicts a wound that deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage (in addition to its normal damage), but it also deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage to you. The curse remains dormant until the weapon hits a creature, at which point black thorns protrude from the weapon and dig into your body; the weapon fuses to you and you can’t use the hand that holds the weapon for any other purpose. If the weapon is two-handed, it attaches itself to only a single hand (GM’s choice). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.688,r=0.472,b=0.880), with ID 7cfd4cc0-aa4f-47f6-ac39-18de80a73c9c -->

DEGENERATING                CURSE 5
RARE  ACID  CURSED  MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.888,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 73efee71-d1f0-470e-bd47-c3fc6413dfb3 -->

Failure makes the weapon crumble. Whenever you critically fail
an attack roll with the weapon, the *degenerating* curse deals 1d10
acid damage to the weapon, ignoring its Hardness and resistances. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.293,r=0.862,b=0.345), with ID a1a4e677-01e6-463c-9c08-817e1663196c -->

GRANDSTANDING CURSE 11
RARE CURSED MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
Weapons with the grandstanding curse inspire overconfidence in their wielders, demanding style over pragmatism. Whenever you reduce a foe to 0 Hit Points, you lose all remaining actions on your turn, as you are compelled to flourish, gloat, pose, or otherwise waste your time in response. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.352,r=0.863,b=0.481), with ID 7c6c94ee-6b2e-4c76-95f1-81ba815817ab -->

RAUCOUS CURSE 3
RARE CURSED MAGICAL
Usage curses gear or a weapon
While more annoying than deadly, a raucous curse is the bane of subtlety. Whenever you use the affected item, you must loudly yell what you are attempting to do with it, ruining any attempts at stealth. Failure to announce your action or speak at an appropriate volume automatically causes the attempted action to become a critical failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.489,r=0.863,b=0.634), with ID 0f4f449f-ef1c-4935-8728-22ce96d6ac7a -->

RAVENOUS CURSE 1

RARE CURSED MAGICAL

Usage curses a ring, staff, or wand

A ravenous curse draws power from the wielder’s body. Whenever you activate the item, you become incredibly hungry and immediately begin to starve (page 43). You require 10 times as much food as normal for the next day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.643,r=0.862,b=0.756), with ID 1c7c93e6-b07e-40eb-8a4b-165a2fa17fcf -->

STAINING                                                                                   CURSE 1

RARE  CURSED  MAGICAL

Usage curses gear or a weapon

This property is associated with a specific color, which is defined at the time of the curse’s creation. Whenever you use the affected equipment while taking a manipulate action with another object, the second object is permanently stained the associated color. For instance, if you used a set of yellow staining lockpicks to open a door, the lock would permanently become yellow. This color change does not otherwise unnaturally persist and can be changed via any normal mundane or magical means. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.766,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID edc2acf3-8869-4ea9-8a49-948e99d2480d -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative user interface element with the number "307" prominently displayed, likely representing a score, currency, or resource count in a game or application.

screenshot:
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a rectangular UI panel with ornate green and gold trim at the top, featuring symmetrical abstract shapes and a central diamond motif.
  • The number "307" is displayed in large, bold, brown text on a gold background within the panel.
  • The background is dark brown, and the overall colour palette is green, gold, and brown.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • The number "307" is the only visible text.
  • The panel has a stylized left edge with a green outline.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The number "307" is centered horizontally within the gold panel.
  • Decorative elements are positioned above the number, framing the top of the panel.

Analysis : 
  • The design suggests this is a resource or score indicator from a game or gamified application, with the ornate trim providing a fantasy or medieval aesthetic.
  • The number "307" is likely meant to be easily visible and quickly referenced by the user. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.896,t=0.921,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID d3d51c4b-3fef-46b5-a936-b5457b0784f2 -->

# RELICS

*Some extraordinary magic items grow in power along with a character, gaining abilities that add to an adventurer’s legend. These are called relics, and owning one can define a character more than any other magic item.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.079,r=0.910,b=0.166), with ID 2b9069bd-2b18-4c0d-9f2f-fca5b0381a7d -->

Relics begin as a simple item, called a relic seed, which is
little more than a functional item with a minor magical
effect associated with it. As the owner of the relic grows
in power, so does the relic. It develops gifts, which are
new magical abilities and activations. These abilities
might be themed to the relic, the character, or the nature
of the campaign. If a relic is passed to another character,
this process begins anew, sometimes granting the same
abilities again over time, but possibly unlocking entirely
new powers. If someone else takes the relic from its
owner, it usually works for a while, though it might lose
its power incrementally over time if not returned to its
owner. How the relic changes in such a circumstance is
up to you and should fit the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.202,r=0.515,b=0.418), with ID 77ddc240-2584-481d-9ba5-3385b00e99cd -->

The decision to add relics to the game is entirely up to you as the GM. If you decide to add them, you’ll need to adjust treasure somewhat. It’s also wise to consider how many players you expect to end up with relics. Will they each get one? Or will there be just one or two tied to the theme of the campaign? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.419,r=0.514,b=0.511), with ID 4a9f6b6b-14f3-4e9c-962c-ce949a7fd3a9 -->

Some relics might begin as ordinary items with a rich history. They might be part of a character’s starting gear, only to have their true powers uncovered later during play. Other relics can be acquired during play as part of the ongoing story. Regardless of their origin, these powerful items might not appear to be much at first, but they contain the potential to become something truly great. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.520,r=0.514,b=0.647), with ID 10b2ad57-a648-410b-838a-2066c79f4ac2 -->

For example, an old, tarnished amulet found around the neck of a buried king might turn out to be an item of deep historical significance that awakens to great power. The seemingly ordinary family sword, passed down to each new generation, might unlock hidden potential through the deeds of its owner. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.648,r=0.513,b=0.739), with ID 34241d35-cbb5-4f13-a33d-e1777df62ce2 -->

The PCs might immediately recognize a relic for its
ability, or they might carry it for a time before its true
nature becomes apparent. The story of a relic should be
a tale of discovery. At first, a relic’s wielder likely doesn’t
fully understand the item’s power, or might be unable to
use it, learning of its abilities only after a momentous event
or fortuitous breakthrough. Ultimately, relics are powerful
tools in service of the story, working as a valuable tie to the
narrative, but their growth and development are in your
hands. Because of the place relics hold in the story, they
aren’t available for purchase, nor can they be crafted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.740,r=0.513,b=0.907), with ID aa7e762e-6c09-43fb-ab40-32fd4a6731f7 -->

Pay attention to the characters’ backstories for  
potential relics, and look for spots in your narrative <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.908,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID d12389e5-021c-4017-8d0b-6ba73c97dcd5 -->

that might be suitable for campaign relics. If you’re
planning to use relics in your game, let the players know
in advance, since their ideas and plans can guide you and
give them greater investment in the relics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.203,r=0.905,b=0.266), with ID 321604d5-fc07-49e0-8e70-711c0e3175ad -->

**Background Relics**
A background relic is tied to the history of a character, and its form and abilities should draw inspiration from the story of their character’s life or the past of the item. The relic could be a gift from a friend or mentor, an heirloom from the character’s family, a found object from their upbringing, or even the first item they ever crafted. The player should select the form of the relic (a battered longsword, a copper ring, or a threadbare red cloak, for example). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.276,r=0.904,b=0.419), with ID 56662806-2328-4e77-ae10-08988eb2213b -->

Campaign Relics  
A campaign relic is drawn from the ongoing story of the campaign. You decide the entirety of the item, from its form to its aspects (described below) as part of the story of the campaign. Use campaign relics to reinforce and foreshadow the themes of your game. Relics come to those who need them to do great deeds, after all, so finding a relic with the perfect aspects for your future challenges is entirely likely. Unlike background relics, campaign relics typically have magical abilities when first found. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.430,r=0.904,b=0.587), with ID ffbb10d8-6a09-4d52-a9fe-3f9a9009cd39 -->

# RELIC ASPECTS
Each relic is associated with aspects—typically two—that speak to its overall concept and purpose. The individual gifts each have an associated aspect. You should almost always select gifts that have an aspect matching one of those found on the relic. For example, a brass dagger recovered from the Medina Mudii’a might have the fire and mind aspects, which means that it could have the flare bolt gift (which has the fire aspect), but not the rolling geode gift (which has the earth aspect). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.598,r=0.903,b=0.754), with ID 970a6380-3215-40d4-861d-33c291ec736f -->

Usually, you can determine at least one aspect of a relic
easily by looking at the history of the item or personality
of the character. For example, if a player decides that their
background relic is a rusty mace wielded by the character’s
great grandmother in battle against rising undead hordes,
the mace might have the life aspect, as it was used to slay
countless undead creatures. There’s no harm in letting the
player choose an aspect for a background relic; through
play, the item will reveal another aspect associated with
it. In the previous example, the mace might reveal itself
to have powers against demons as well, in which case its
aspects might be celestial and life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.756,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID e05a9c4e-ec88-4b77-b2ce-b1f3af2f627b -->

ADVANCING A RELIC  
As a relic’s bearer performs mighty deeds and advances their story, the relic gets stronger. The most basic advancement for a relic is its level, which always matches that of its owner. Weapons and armor can gain fundamental runes normally. You decide what, if any, property runes can be added to a given relic; by default, they can’t have property runes, like any other specific item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.203), with ID 5cc38262-f327-4348-a7f4-3a4788828d08 -->

The more complex advancement comes from gifts.
The Relic Gifts table shows the typical number of gifts a
relic should have at a given level, but relics don’t follow
this strictly. Rather, gifts arise according to the pace of
the story, the needs of the campaign, and the relationship
between the character and the relic. Generally speaking,
this results in a relic gaining one gift for every 4 levels
its bearer has, but this might fluctuate as the campaign
progresses. For example, a relic might gain its first gift at
4th level after the bearer defeats a powerful foe. It might
then gain its second at 7th, after they perform a special
ritual. That same relic might not gain another gift until
13th level and then again at 16th as the player reaches
other major milestones. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.204,r=0.472,b=0.417), with ID 98c6c268-14fd-4d83-89dd-6fb059051a57 -->

The gift types—minor, major, and grand—indicate their general power level. Again, the table indicates what's generally appropriate at certain levels, but you can alter them as you see fit. You should usually avoid giving a minor gift at 10th level or higher, because it just won't be that impressive, though some of them scale well enough to be interesting at higher levels. The Gold Piece Equivalent entry for each gift helps you determine how much you should reduce treasure when using relics (see Adjusting Treasure below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.419,r=0.471,b=0.557), with ID e8317292-a22e-4ba1-b216-2241368ff6df -->

You decide what gifts a relic gains, generally by either
selecting a single gift or offering two paths for the relic
to grow and allowing the player to choose, but this
should be informed by the story and the nature of the
character bearing the relic. A relic should complement
the bearer, bolstering the bearer’s strengths and helping
to overcome their weaknesses. Within that framework,
you should try to maintain a cohesive theme for the relic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.708,r=0.471,b=0.834), with ID d9ee2f80-2005-462c-9594-2140ecf9103a -->

# ADJUSTING TREASURE
When you incorporate relics into your game, you can adjust the treasure gained by the party down to account for the relics increasing in power. Essentially, some of the treasure from the Party Treasure by Level table on page 59 should be replaced with relic seeds and gifts instead. You <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.842,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 31913340-853d-4a0b-8ea2-3a543c139b58 -->

can use the relic’s minimum level, replacing a permanent
item of that level, or you can use the gp equivalent. Keep in
mind that relic gifts are often a little more powerful than
other items with the same Price even when they start out,
and they often scale without any additional costs, so PCs
with relics will usually be a bit more powerful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.082,r=0.861,b=0.172), with ID 5a74f6bb-368e-442d-b307-8a6c80b08c84 -->

If you prefer, you can grant relics in addition to other
rewards. This means PCs will be much more powerful,
but you’re rewarding their investment in the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.173,r=0.860,b=0.219), with ID 93f0a62c-36aa-4dd9-85f8-93028c569791 -->

# MAKING RELIC SEEDS
A relic seed can be quite simple: imagine a standard item with two aspects and an appearance that matches the theme. You can also use an existing magic item for a campaign relic; pick two aspects for it, and tweak its appearance or characteristics to make it clearly different from other items of its type. You can choose a tradition for the seed and apply that trait to the seed and all the gifts of the seed. This tradition might be derived from the background of the item, or it might appear or change through story moments involving the relic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.229,r=0.861,b=0.402), with ID 36fde7a1-0fe3-4590-ae75-adb4c5eea641 -->

If you want a relic to have an additional special
benefit, you can design it to grant a bonus to a skill,
typically a +1 item bonus for a 3rd-level relic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.403,r=0.861,b=0.449), with ID d2c881dd-cd2c-451b-9b8d-6493428b41e1 -->

## RELIC GIFTS
Gifts are divided up into three tiers. Minor gifts grant useful, often scaling abilities and are available early in a character’s career. Major gifts define a relic, determining its true purpose and granting powerful abilities. Grand gifts are the pinnacle of power, and most relics never have more than one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.460,r=0.861,b=0.556), with ID ec10e88f-1f9b-4d28-a2bf-0330ef46daa4 -->

The more gifts there are of one aspect, the more the
relic reflects that aspect, and the more influence the aspect
has on the character who wields it. An item with multiple
shadow gifts might begin to lose its color. With four or
five, the character that wields it might take on an ashen
tone and the relic might become entirely made of shadow. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.557,r=0.861,b=0.648), with ID 7f5812a6-3e4f-40cb-90b5-d3dd56e09990 -->

Gift Saves and Spell Attack Modifiers  
Many gifts allow for a saving throw or have other abilities that change as the relic goes up in level. The DC for any saving throw called for by a gift is the higher of its owner’s class DC or spell DC. The spell attack modifier of a gift is 10 lower than that DC. A relic’s counteract modifier is equal to its owner’s counteract modifier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.659,r=0.861,b=0.771), with ID 8e57dc41-2e7e-4870-9d6e-bd0451b08b35 -->

UNDERGROUND BOUNTY                MAJOR GIFT

EARTH | METAL
Aspect earth
Your relic produces metals and stones to empower your weapons. Each day during your daily preparations, your relic conjures a magical shard of silver, cold iron, gold, or a non-precious stone or metal material of your choice (such as bronze or granite). If your relic is a weapon, it immediately absorbs the shard, causing it to gain a magical sheen of that metal or stone until your next daily preparations. If your relic is not a weapon, the shard is not immediately used, and you can touch it to a stone or metal weapon using an Interact action to give it a magical sheen of that metal or stone for 10 minutes. While coated in the magical sheen, the weapon interacts with weaknesses, resistances, and the like as if it were made of the stone or metal from the shard rather than its own. The sheen and the shard are obviously magical in nature, and if you don’t use the shard, it disappears when you make your next daily preparations. At 17th level, add adamantine and dawnsilver to the available options. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.456,r=0.474,b=0.758), with ID 8c37f1af-0cec-44a0-b7a5-9a7fa0a4b1a2 -->

GRAPPLING VINE                MAJOR GIFT

PLANT
Aspect plant
Activate (manipulate) Effect Your relic launches a sticky, multi-stranded vine at a target within 50 feet. Make an attack roll as you would when using a grappling hook, but if you roll a critical failure on the check to secure the vine, you get a failure instead. Once the vine is anchored, creatures receive a +1 status bonus to Athletics checks to Climb the vine, and they gain a +5-foot status bonus to the distance they move with a successful check while Climbing using the vine.

PETAL DANCE                MAJOR GIFT

PLANT
Aspect plant

Activate ◈◈ (concentrate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You discorporate into a cloud of petals and leaves. This grants you the swarm trait, immunity to falling damage, resistance 5 to bludgeoning and slashing damage, and weakness 5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces only a few inches wide, moving your constituent petals through the gap. You don’t gain the swarm mind ability, so you’re still affected normally by mental effects. As a swarm, you can’t speak, cast spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items, or make any of your Strikes with your normal body. You remain in this form for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the activation. At 13th level, the relic gains a reaction that triggers when you fall or take damage, applying this gift’s resistances, weaknesses, and immunity to falling damage to the triggering effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.579,r=0.474,b=0.864), with ID 22ffcff1-35a1-48f4-b6f5-25c5e13575b4 -->

day; Effect With a pulse of natural energy, your relic grows massive plants in an instant. The megaflora is of one of the following types, chosen by the GM when the relic gains this gift. A megaflora appears in an unoccupied 10-foot space within 30 feet and has 50 Hit Points, weakness 5 to fire, AC 37, Reflex +20, and Fortitude +30.

- • Corpseflower A single putrid-smelling flower grows at the target location. While the flower persists, each round at the end of your turn, all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the plant except you must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened 2 (also stunned 2 on a critical failure). This is a poison effect.
- • Thorns A 10-foot-tall thorned plant or bamboo stalk grows at the target location. While the stalk persists, each round at the end of your turn, sharp stakes erupt from the ground, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the plant except you (basic Reflex).
- • Tree of Life A large tree bearing life-giving fruit grows at the target location. While the tree persists, living creatures within reach of the tree can use an Interact action to pick and eat one of the tree’s fruits, regaining 2d8+5 Hit Points; picking a fruit without eating it causes the fruit to instantly vanish. This is a healing and wood effect, and a given creature can heal from the tree only once per round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.189,r=0.866,b=0.466), with ID b557abba-3bd3-4760-9abc-128a1321391f -->

The shadows at your feet can hold objects. You can Interact with your shadow to store or remove objects, just like you would a mundane container. Your shadow can contain 3 Bulk of objects, which don’t count toward the Bulk you are carrying. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can store 1 additional Bulk of objects in your shadow.

PLAYER-DRIVEN RELICS  
Though these rules assume you as the GM are providing relic gifts as a form of treasure with input from the players, you can instead have the players make all the decisions for their relics. Encourage the players to choose different styles of items and aspects to match their characters’ themes, rather than simply choosing the most powerful combination of options. Have players describe how their relic gets more powerful in the story. What acts from previous sessions lent the relic power? What special meditations or practices did they perform to unlock new gifts? How does it feel to have the relic grow?  
As the item and the character level up, the player chooses which gifts the item gets from the list as a part of character advancement. You still adjust treasure as normal for incorporating relics into your game. In fact, if the player tries to optimize the combinations, they will likely be more powerful than under the standard method. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.074,r=0.513,b=0.386), with ID 8832f80f-c121-444a-9e9e-a8bcf3188b89 -->

DANCING SHADOW                MAJOR GIFT

SHADOW

Aspect shadow; Prerequisites The relic is a weapon.

Activate (concentrate, manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect Your relic’s shadow detaches from your relic and dances through the air to attack an enemy. When you Activate the relic, designate a target. The relic’s shadow flies up to 60 feet until it’s adjacent to that foe and then makes a Strike against it, dealing 5d8 damage on a success or double that on a critical success; the damage type is of any type normally dealt by your relic. The shadow uses your attack bonus with the relic, and it uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. While this activation is in effect, you can use a single action, which has the attack and concentrate traits, to mentally direct the shadow to make another Strike against the same target. The shadow lasts until that target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, that target moves more than 400 feet from you, or that target moves to an area where no shadow could be cast, such as an area of complete darkness, whichever comes first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.459,r=0.515,b=0.770), with ID 359fa002-9f0d-4665-bc09-477f4487bd52 -->

The shadow doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would, and it automatically follows the chosen foe. The shadow can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.770,r=0.514,b=0.848), with ID abf98400-19cd-4f00-9c08-924c0f5e75a4 -->

If the destination is not within an area of bright light, the range is instead 60 feet.

GRAND GIFT

SHADOW

Aspect shadow  
Activate  (concentrate, manipulate) Effect Shadowy essence infuses your body, and you can reshape wisps of yourself into a variety of damaging shadows. This has the effect of a 6th-rank shadow blast, choosing from only bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage. You can’t use this activation again for 1d4 rounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.198,r=0.905,b=0.342), with ID 2f9b8ff8-9996-4e45-bc63-49a11627c923 -->

LASHING CURRENTS                MINOR GIFT

WATER

Aspect water; Prerequisites The relic is a weapon.
Water collects at the tip of your relic. You can adjust your
grip on your relic with an Interact action to allow you to make
lashing current weapon Strikes with your relic, which deal 1d4
bludgeoning damage; have the disarm, finesse, reach 10, trip,
and versatile S traits; and are in the flail group. Your lashing
current Strikes gain the benefit of your relic’s fundamental and
property runes, though any property runes that would not be
applicable to the lashing currents are not applied. You can use
another Interact action to return to your normal grip and make
Strikes with the relic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.382,r=0.905,b=0.587), with ID aec1e8aa-0c62-4eac-b300-c98136635d68 -->

The wall is 5 feet thick, 30 feet long, up to 30 feet high, and lasts for 1 minute. The wall stands vertically, but you can shape its path. The wall has the following effects.
• If a fire effect crosses through the wall, it either uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its attack roll or its targets use the outcome one degree of success better than the result of their saving throw, as appropriate.
• Creatures with a weakness to water that cross the wall or start their turn in the wall take damage equal to their weakness.
• The wall imposes a –2 status penalty to Perception checks to sense creatures or objects on the other side. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.597,r=0.906,b=0.878), with ID e5a244c8-3cc0-4b6e-b5a2-76cb072211c9 -->

  • No UI elements or extraneous markings.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The "5" is centrally placed, with ample space on all sides.

  • The image is likely intended to highlight or label the number "5" prominently, possibly as part of a sequence or for emphasis in a presentation or graphic. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.879,t=0.003,r=0.998,b=0.060), with ID f920b43d-00f4-485c-8116-2b651552a7fa -->

RUNES AS GIFTS
You can substitute runes for gifts. If you choose to allow property runes on the relic, you’ll want them to take up rune slots. Otherwise, you can give as many or as few as you prefer, just like any other gifts. Runes are sorted into minor, major, and grand categories, but you should use their normal level and Price when you adjust treasure, instead of the number and levels on the Relic Gifts table. If you’re using the player-driven relics variant, it’s recommended you do not include this option.

  character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and  
  it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell  
  has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice  
  the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent  
  being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success  
  better. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.132,t=0.063,r=0.518,b=0.947), with ID 9c005ebc-1854-4ca4-aa0d-7420342f980d -->

**incorporeal** (trait) An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it's slowed 1 until the end of its turn. A corporeal and an incorporeal creature can pass through one another, but they can't end their movement in each other's space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.148,r=0.908,b=0.263), with ID 4c7bcdf5-8c9c-4179-89b6-599bbe331e26 -->

An incorporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based
checks against physical creatures or objects—only against
incorporeal ones—unless those objects have the ghost
touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature
can’t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal
creatures or objects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.537,t=0.264,r=0.907,b=0.350), with ID d7ee2360-9cbe-4548-a4aa-8d22fc45ee87 -->

Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the *ghost touch* property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.538,t=0.350,r=0.906,b=0.436), with ID ae45eca2-9945-4ef8-93d9-6080d577ed12 -->

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. _PC_ 401 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.784,r=0.860,b=0.913), with ID cbc9cf42-2985-445c-915d-2f1af9d0b6c0 -->

Summary : This image shows a stylized, symmetrical decorative motif with two abstract human-like figures on either side of a central diamond shape, all outlined in gold against a dark green and brown background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a decorative border or emblem featuring two abstract, circular-headed figures with raised arms on the left and right.
  • A central diamond shape is positioned between the figures, also outlined in gold.
  • The background is divided into a dark green upper section and a dark brown lower section, with the motif bridging both areas.
  • The composition is symmetrical, with mirrored elements on each side of the central diamond.

Technical Details :
  • No text, scale bar, or UI elements are present.
  • The gold outlines contrast with the dark background, enhancing the motif's visibility.
  • The image is cropped, showing only the upper portion of the design.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two abstract figures are positioned on either side of the central diamond, with their arms curving upward and inward.
  • The diamond is centered both vertically and horizontally within the visible crop.
  • The motif appears to be part of a larger border or ornamental design.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of symmetry and formality, likely intended as a decorative accent or emblem.
  • The use of gold outlines against dark backgrounds suggests a design meant to evoke elegance or tradition.
  • The abstract human-like forms and central diamond may symbolize unity or celebration. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.893,t=0.251,r=0.999,b=0.287), with ID 8cd42d39-b86c-4d4e-8e7a-7731e9d68fcb -->

morph (trait) Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).
    Your morph effects might also end if you’re polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can’t. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.133,t=0.069,r=0.519,b=0.321), with ID 1572f6ab-2050-4e14-b1be-fd485817c3f7 -->
