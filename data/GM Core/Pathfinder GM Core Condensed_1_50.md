# INTRODUCTION

*The focus of every Pathfinder game is the player characters—they’re the stars of the show and appear in every scene that plays out in-game. But what about those scenes? What stories are being told? What old legends are being discovered, and what new ones are being forged? Who are the villains, the allies, the traitors, the lovers, the monsters, and the gods? Who runs the world? When you’re the Game Master, that’s all up to you!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.534,r=0.919,b=0.668), with ID 3a41424b-e32f-4d7a-95fa-3260903b19a3 -->

# The Game Master
In Pathfinder, the Game Master (often abbreviated as GM) is the player in charge of the story and the world the other players are exploring. When you’re the GM, you take on the rewarding role of crafting fun experiences for a group of your friends. Your responsibilities include...

- • Telling the story of the group’s adventures in a compelling and consistent way.
- • Fleshing out the world in which the game takes place, emphasizing the fantastical while grounding it enough in the real world to feel believable.
- • Entertaining the players and yourself with novel concepts and rewarding creative ideas with interesting outcomes.
- • Preparing for game sessions by building or studying adventures and creating characters and plots. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.687,r=0.518,b=0.943), with ID 6c766f8e-ab0f-47f1-ba1a-00c5c51325ec -->

- • Improvising the reactions of nonplayer characters (NPCs) and other forces in the world as the players do unexpected things.
- • Making rules decisions to ensure fairness and keep the game moving forward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.694,r=0.908,b=0.770), with ID 52e14712-1cac-4afa-b4ea-a0132a308923 -->

Though the word “master” is in the GM’s title, it’s not
a role that requires—or even benefits from—absolutism.
Pathfinder is a collaborative experience, and while
your role as the Game Master is one of adjudicator or
moderator, it doesn’t mean you control everything at
the table, especially not the players and their characters.
Nor does the role require mastery, either of the rules
or the setting. You’ll need to understand the game, but
you don’t need to have every rule memorized. When
everyone shares the goal of having fun and telling a story
together, the details will fall into place. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.770,r=0.906,b=0.941), with ID 78e835c8-d8a7-4af9-aab3-0d672161dfbb -->

# HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
GM Core is one of the central rule books for Pathfinder, and it provides guidance on building and running whatever fantastic stories you wish to tell. The book also gives information on the Age of Lost Omens—the setting of Pathfinder—as well as rules variants and tools you can use to customize the game. Lastly, the book contains the magical items and other treasure that you can place throughout your adventure to reward your PCs for their victories. Tips and advice for running a smooth game are included as well! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.234), with ID a35db7a4-68b0-4cd2-b29d-2bd5a9b423e4 -->

Pathfinder as a game is all about customization, and this
book provides you as the Game Master ways to customize
your game just as a player customizes their character.
The toolbox nature of _GM Core_ makes it easy to select
whatever parts you need for the game you’re running at
any time, especially in the Building Games and Subsystems
chapters. As with any toolbox, you won’t need to use
everything at once! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.234,r=0.473,b=0.358), with ID ecbb1967-de33-4e90-8c82-273989aca273 -->

# CHOOSING YOUR TOOLS
No two Game Masters are the same. Perhaps you’re a
veteran GM who’s looking for new ways to tailor your
game to suit your interests and those of your players. Or
perhaps you’re a brand-new GM looking for guidance
to feel comfortable leading a game of your own. Maybe
you’ve been a GM for years, but this is your first time
running a Pathfinder game. No matter where you are as
a Game Master, this book is a valuable tool that can help
you tell the stories you want to tell with your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.366,r=0.473,b=0.528), with ID a08d1e98-f596-464f-a220-1e1ed4f4a806 -->

I’m a New Game Master  
You’ll find a wealth of information to help you feel confident in running your games. Chapter 1: Running Games can help you better understand how to run a game in different modes of play, set DCs, give out rewards, adjudicate the rules quickly and fairly, and adapt when special circumstances or problems crop up at your table. This chapter also contains advice on using and determining rarity in your game, working with your players to create a collaborative story, and adapting your game to meet the needs of the players at your table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.535,r=0.473,b=0.712), with ID 752190b1-e92a-4e00-a5be-6e1c1ede30cb -->

## I’m Running a Published Adventure
You’ll find guidance in Chapter 1 specifically for running published adventures, and most of the advice in that chapter about running a game applies to published adventures. The information in Chapter 3 gives you a primer on the Age of Lost Omens setting, introducing the world and its nations, peoples, and history that you’ll find featured in Pathfinder’s published stories. A number of adventures—especially scenarios in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes—use the subsystems in Chapter 4. The Victory Points subsystem is the most fundamental of these, but many adventures also use the other subsystems found there for things like vehicles, chases, and influence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.718,r=0.473,b=0.942), with ID 1cdd6fa1-306e-4021-bdbe-58e739283517 -->

REMEMBER THE FIRST RULE  
The first rule of Pathfinder is that **this game is yours.** The rest of the rules exist for you to use to tell the stories you want to tell and share exciting adventures with your friends. There are plenty of rules in this book, but none of them override that first rule. Take the rules that help you make the game you want, change those that don’t do quite what you need them to, and leave the ones that aren’t helping. It’s your game. There’s no right or wrong way to GM so long as everyone is having fun—and that includes you! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.496,t=0.087,r=0.853,b=0.267), with ID 4c1fe734-95f1-400e-ac73-95c74383166a -->

CAMPAIGNS, ADVENTURES, AND ENCOUNTERS  
The rules and advice in this book frequently refer to three main structures of a game. A campaign is your group's game as a whole, a serialized story consisting of one or more adventures. Each adventure tells a single story arc with a beginning, middle, and end; it includes many interactions, challenges, and encounters. An encounter is a single showdown or contest between the player characters and their foes or other nonplayer characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.275,r=0.850,b=0.423), with ID 5898fd12-0ef5-40af-84ef-39a39a9dff1e -->

I'm Making My Own Adventure  
If you are looking to create your own Pathfinder adventures, Chapter 2 provides you design guidance ranging from the broad strokes of building an entire campaign, to individual adventures, to the particular considerations of any given encounter. This chapter also provides a toolbox you can use to build the creatures, hazards, items, and other elements you want to use in your adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.443,r=0.863,b=0.572), with ID 6f926bb2-afeb-4dcc-86fe-e7f18a55870a -->

If you plan to set your adventures in a world of your own design, the world-building section of Chapter 2 can guide that process and help you establish the details you’ll need to ensure your setting is a vibrant backdrop for fantastic stories. You can also use the information on nations, settlements, and planes in Chapter 3 to detail those parts of your world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.572,r=0.863,b=0.679), with ID eac7801d-efc1-4759-b260-bba45a0a8a6c -->

I Need Items!
New and experienced GMs alike will find the treasures in Chapter 5 of great interest, whether you’re looking up what a reward in a published Pathfinder adventure might be or searching for just the right piece of magical gear to give your players after a quest. Persistent items like magical weapons and armor can serve as longstanding parts of a player’s kit, and consumable items like potions or talismans can inject fun one-off effects into your party. Lastly, the chapter contains highly narrative items that can play a role in campaigns all on their own, from artifacts and cursed items to powerful relics that grow alongside your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.689,r=0.862,b=0.878), with ID a0b82a7b-9112-4b1f-91e2-5e79368fbb4b -->

In many campaigns, you can let players freely peruse
this chapter to find items they like. This is especially true
when players craft magic items or have broad access to
magic item shops in Absalom or a similar location. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.879,r=0.863,b=0.940), with ID e73f1fbd-9957-4c33-83ab-efd21b30742c -->

# CHAPTER 1:
RUNNING THE GAME

*As Game Master, you run each session of Pathfinder, providing the link between the players and the world of the game. It’s up to you to set the scene as the player characters battle monsters, interact with other people, and explore new locations.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.535,r=0.909,b=0.647), with ID 6c09f459-c3f3-4c6f-8845-753ec4c60998 -->

This chapter provides the tools you need to shoulder
those responsibilities. The following sections break
down the various components of a campaign, discuss
the different modes of play and how to set DCs for
the tasks the PCs attempt, provide different ways of
rewarding player characters, and describe aspects of the
environment that might affect an adventuring party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.677,r=0.514,b=0.787), with ID 95798ad6-68dd-42d7-8945-07b5b79ae2f8 -->

A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT  
The role of Game Master comes with the responsibility of ensuring you and the rest of the players have a rewarding, fun time during the game. Games can deal with difficult subjects and have stressful moments, but fundamentally Pathfinder is a leisure activity. It can remain so only if the players follow a social contract and respect one another. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.796,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 3a3a536f-0299-4cb0-aac3-ddd002c6baaa -->

Players with physical or mental disabilities might find themselves more challenged than abled players. Work with your players to ensure they have the resources and support they need. Additionally, be on the lookout for inappropriate behavior, whether intentional or inadvertent, and pay careful attention to players’ body language during the game. If you notice a player becoming uncomfortable, you are empowered to pause the game, take it in a new direction, privately check in with your players during or after the session, or take any other action you think is appropriate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.678,r=0.905,b=0.847), with ID d4000b47-b27d-4ea3-96d3-39c803e4da06 -->

If a player tells you they’re uncomfortable with
something in the game, whether it’s content you’ve
presented as the GM or another player’s or PC’s actions,
listen carefully to that player and take steps to ensure
they can once again have fun during your game. If
you’re preparing prewritten material and you find a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.848,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID ac743f9c-89ec-4f9e-82bc-a3f0727591bb -->

RUNNING THE GAME <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.660,t=0.019,r=0.868,b=0.042), with ID 5ade9a8a-8fa8-4c87-bcad-9789b8d5c7dd -->

character or a situation inappropriate, you are fully
empowered to change any details as you see fit. You also
have the authority (and responsibility) to ask players
to change their behavior—or even leave the table—if
what they’re doing is unacceptable or makes others
feel uncomfortable. It’s never appropriate to make the
person who is uncomfortable responsible for resolving a
problem. It’s okay if mistakes happen. What’s important
is how you respond and move forward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.218), with ID 44c183ca-d3ed-4931-92d0-ad9ab5b41f28 -->

Gaming is for everyone. Never let those acting in bad
faith undermine your game or exclude other players.
Your efforts are part of the long-term process of making
games and game culture welcoming to all. Working
together, we can build a community where players of all
identities and experiences feel safe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.219,r=0.472,b=0.311), with ID a8420650-9744-4cec-9b03-ce4f3b5eb750 -->

Objectionable Content  
Before a campaign begins, check in with your players—
as a group or individually—to find out what types of
content they want to allow in the game and which topics
they would prefer to avoid. Because the story unfolds
in real time, it’s essential that you discuss these topics
before the game starts, often in a session zero (see page
9). These discussions are intended to keep players safe,
so it’s not okay to ask why someone wants a type of
content banned. If someone wants it banned, ban it—no
questions asked. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.321,r=0.471,b=0.493), with ID 4ba5f246-13f7-469a-bfc6-430708370d7a -->

It can help to start with a rating, like those used for
movies or video games. Pathfinder games often include
violence and cruelty. What’s the limit on how graphically
these concepts should be described? Can players swear
at the table? Does anyone have phobias they don’t want
to appear in the game, such as spiders or body horror? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.495,r=0.471,b=0.588), with ID fa588dfe-ba3f-4ac8-b4e8-5e760ac95e55 -->

- Clearly convey these limits to the other players.
- Ensure you and the players abide by the boundaries.
- Act immediately if someone becomes uncomfortable about content during a session, even if it wasn’t already banned in a prior discussion. Once the issue is resolved, move on.
- Resolve the issue if any player deliberately pushes these boundaries, tries to find loopholes, tries to renegotiate the limits, or belittles people for having a different tolerance to objectionable content. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.588,r=0.471,b=0.771), with ID a9f4d15d-4757-4f04-a136-4e76938cd46a -->

The Pathfinder Baseline  
You might find that your players don’t have much to say on the topic of objectionable content and just assume that general societal mores will keep the most uncomfortable topics out of the game. That’s not always enough, as that approach relies on shared assumptions that aren’t always accurate. The following is a set of basic assumptions that works for many groups, which you can modify to fit your preferences and those of the other players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.781,r=0.471,b=0.939), with ID 87289336-a879-439f-9a1d-77c1a689444b -->

## TOOLS FOR RESPONSIBLE PLAY
Consent and comfort are important topics for roleplaying games, and many designers have created techniques to facilitate responsible play. Some methods you can use are lines and veils, developed by Ron Edwards, and the X-Card, developed by John Stavropoulos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.089,r=0.850,b=0.189), with ID e8a793ea-8752-4b6a-a9d3-46466dc4fdce -->

## Lines and Veils
The terms “line” and “veil” can give your table a common vocabulary for the concepts described in this section. A line is a hard limit to the actions players might take, such as “We’re drawing a line at torture.” The group agrees not to cross a line and omits that content from the game. A veil indicates something that shouldn’t be described in detail. The scene fades to black, or the group moves on to discuss a different topic, though whatever the veil is drawn across still happens. For example, you might say, “We’ll draw a veil as those characters head into the bedroom.” Players might find they need to modify their lines and veils as play continues. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.200,r=0.848,b=0.389), with ID e3376dbf-3f69-4b9d-bd3b-d0efdb45e098 -->

The X-Card  
Draw an “X” on a card, and you’ve got an X-Card. Place it on the table at the start of the session. Any player can silently reject content they find upsetting by tapping the X-Card; whoever is speaking then rewinds a bit and continues on, excising the content. As with setting the basic campaign guidelines, there are no questions asked, no judgment, and no argument when someone taps the X-Card. You can, however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as “How far back should I rewind?” Some groups instead make an X with their hands, say “Let’s X that out,” or use some other method. Either way, follow up with the player privately after the game to see if the guidelines need to be revised. You can find more details at tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.398,r=0.852,b=0.618), with ID 09d05fb5-401c-4769-9a1c-3e064fed9b42 -->

- • Bloodshed, injuries, and even dismemberment might be described. However, excessive descriptions of gore and cruelty should be avoided.
- • Romantic and sexual relationships can happen in the game, but players should avoid being overly suggestive. Sex always happens “off-screen.” Because attempts at initiating a relationship between player characters can be uncomfortably similar to one player hitting on another, this should generally be avoided (and is entirely inappropriate when playing with strangers).
- • Avoid excessively gross or scatological descriptions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.647,r=0.862,b=0.828), with ID 2360400c-dda2-4ea8-8662-e076b18e7321 -->

- • Torture
- • Rape, nonconsensual sexual contact, or sexual threats
- • Harm to children, including sexual abuse
- • Owning slaves or profiting from the slave trade
- • Reprehensible uses of mind-control magic <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.831,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 8f6251e5-d58d-4db8-9ecf-7e793f91535e -->

## COLLABORATION DURING PLAY
As Game Master, you have the final say on how the world and rules function and how nonplayer characters act. This rule’s purpose is to make the game run smoothly, with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It’s not intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!

How you implement collaboration in a game depends on what your players are interested in. In some groups, players enjoy adding details to the world and to the nonplayer characters. In others, players want to feel like the world is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to make are those made by their own characters. Both are fun and acceptable ways to play. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.148,t=0.087,r=0.503,b=0.309), with ID 776a5f55-b50f-4586-a750-03c05b65e38d -->

You are encouraged to collect input from your players before you start, asking what storytelling genres they'd like to emphasize, which areas of the world they want to play in, the types of enemies they'd like to face, or which published adventure they want to play. A good campaign includes some back-and-forth at the beginning as the players figure out what characters they want to play and you figure out what sort of adventure would be most enjoyable for the group. The results can range from building an adventure entirely to fit the characters to choosing a specific published adventure, having the players make their characters, and then adapting the beginning of that adventure so that all the player characters have a reason to be involved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.150,t=0.310,r=0.503,b=0.539), with ID bd4e61f4-f0ad-425f-974c-173c9e4650f5 -->

As you play, opportunities to collaborate will occur
again and again. When players throw out suggestions
or come up with specific theories about the events of
the campaign, they're telling you what they'd like to
see in the game. Try to find ways to incorporate their
suggestions, but with enough of a twist that each still
includes something unexpected. Remember that as the
Game Master, you're a player too—don't forget to include
content that you're excited to see as well! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.540,r=0.504,b=0.682), with ID c727a5bb-9540-4c81-9847-1a7000aa90bd -->

Villains might engage in such acts, but they won’t
happen “on-screen” or won’t be described in detail.
Many groups choose to not have villains engage in these
activities at all, keeping these reprehensible acts out of
mind entirely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.708,r=0.514,b=0.786), with ID 5d0a8c96-0ee8-4967-9049-5ddec53e50a1 -->

Social Spillover  
As important as it is to take care of yourself and the other players in your game, be mindful of your group’s impact on the other people around you. If you’re playing in a space that’s not your own, respect your hosts. If you’re playing in public, consider the comfort of the people around you, not just what your group is comfortable with. It’s easy to get caught up in a game, as we get sucked into the microcosm of an imagined <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.797,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 17ff1c37-0afc-4db1-8680-9cc599e091b7 -->

world, but don’t ignore the real world around you. Be
aware when you’re making too much noise, leaving a
mess, alarming passersby with graphic descriptions of
violence, or even just giving the cold shoulder to curious
spectators witnessing RPG play for the first time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.079,r=0.906,b=0.159), with ID af21b96c-3bc3-4e10-b898-f48bbce0d698 -->

# PREPARING ADVENTURES
An adventure is a self-contained collection of story elements, characters, and settings that form the basis for the story you and the other players tell. Think of the adventure as an outline for your story. You’ll have major beats you want to include, some consistent characters, and themes you want to convey, but all sorts of things can change during the process of turning the outline into a completed story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.168,r=0.905,b=0.310), with ID b1cb2da6-04f9-40b4-834c-d7762ad8c899 -->

You might use a published adventure from Paizo or another company, or you might construct your own adventure as you prepare for your game sessions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.311,r=0.904,b=0.357), with ID 5ae2de9f-2a60-47f8-ae24-c91212fb4a9b -->

Published Adventures  
Prewritten adventures include background information and nonplayer characters needed for the story, plus all the locations, maps, and monster groups necessary for both exploration and encounters. Prewritten adventures can speed up your preparation, since you can simply read the relevant sections of the adventure before a game, and you don’t have to create everything from scratch. A published adventure already includes the expected amount of encounters and treasure, and you can find adventures built for different character levels to match your group. Reading a published adventure or running one as your first game can help you see how adventures are structured, which makes it easier to write one later if you choose. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.368,r=0.904,b=0.600), with ID 0e69889f-e9b8-46b2-8b91-54e7f8c9d7d5 -->

Though a published adventure is prewritten, it’s not
set in stone. Changing the details of an adventure to suit
your group isn’t just acceptable, it’s encouraged! Use the
backstories and predilections of the player characters to
inform how you change the adventure. This can mean
altering adversaries so they’re linked to the player
characters, changing the setting to a place some of the
player characters are from, or excising particular scenes
if you know they won’t appeal to your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.603,r=0.904,b=0.740), with ID 9ac3fa9d-ae82-4af0-aa89-9e4412528f01 -->

Pathfinder Society  
Organized play campaigns allow you to play in and run games all over the world with persistent characters. If you want to play Pathfinder this way, you can do so through the Pathfinder Society program! Once you go online to pathfindersociety.club to make an account, you can organize games yourself with your friends or join an existing event. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.752,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID 8dc78f6c-89da-4e1b-ad2d-874d894e2353 -->

At the start of a session when you’re running a PFS
adventure, you’ll collect your players’ information. At
the end of the adventure, you’ll write down the rewards
their characters earn for completing the scenario on a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.879,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 91314801-cea2-44c9-93d6-e7f9c8534c04 -->

chronicle sheet your players can keep for their records.
The rewards they gain are detailed in each adventure.
Once you report the session’s results online, the rewards
become a persistent part of these characters, even if they
play in other games with other groups. These scenarios
include important choices, and you can report what
your group chose—decisions that will guide the future
of the campaign! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.204), with ID 2533a0ec-0522-4e47-b67b-89d9443f9562 -->

Your Own Adventures
Building your own adventure can be much more challenging than using a published one, but it lets you express yourself, be even more creative, and tailor the game directly to the players and their characters. Chapter 2 contains guidance on building your own adventures, as well as tools and resources for designing content for your players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.214,r=0.471,b=0.341), with ID e557f87c-7722-454b-b2ed-8ddeb015910c -->

Adventure plotting can start at many different points.
You might begin with a particular antagonist, then
construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme
and leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could
start with an interesting location for exploration, then
populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate
to the setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.342,r=0.470,b=0.449), with ID f974cae1-d75b-41a0-91f5-936172991ccf -->

# Character Creation
At the outset of a new campaign, the players will create new player characters. Part of that process involves you introducing what the campaign will be about and what types of characters are most appropriate. Work with the players to determine which rule options are available. The safest options are the common choices from _Player Core_. If players want to use common options from other books or uncommon or rare options, review those options to see if any of them conflict with the style of campaign you have in mind or might present strange surprises down the road. It’s usually best to allow new options, but there’s no obligation to do so. Be as open as you’re comfortable with. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.459,r=0.471,b=0.678), with ID eb138e25-05ad-43cb-b069-1902c5ddda91 -->

Session Zero  
Some groups prefer to have everyone create their characters in advance and show up ready to play. However, getting the group together to make characters can be fun and can benefit your game down the line. A session for building characters is commonly called “session zero.” Session zero is typically shorter than other game sessions, so you might plan a short introductory scene for when everyone has finished building their characters or just hang out and do something else after you’ve planned your characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.690,r=0.470,b=0.862), with ID f05dfbf2-8f90-4b57-ad75-d9199498711c -->

Having a session zero lets players share character
details, making it easier for their characters to have links
and relationships with one another before the adventure
starts, and gives players the chance to become invested
in each other's characters by organically learning what <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.863,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 848be4c7-7154-4371-a09a-0705f87fac12 -->

PAIZO’S PUBLISHED ADVENTURES  
You can purchase the following types of adventures at  
paizo.com, your local game store, or many bookstores. If  
you want to acquire all the adventures in a given line, you  
can purchase a subscription at paizo.com. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.091,r=0.848,b=0.174), with ID 4c0c8e9d-bce9-46a0-bf0a-3a28950bf3ed -->

## Pathfinder Adventure Paths
Each monthly volume of a Pathfinder Adventure Path leads into the next as part of a greater story spanning multiple volumes. The first volume of each Adventure Path typically starts at 1st level, and each volume has a self-contained story that eventually leads to a big climax at the end of the final volume. Each volume also typically includes new monsters, rules, and details about the world. Each Adventure Path has a different theme, and their settings range across the Inner Sea region and beyond. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.185,r=0.847,b=0.356), with ID b0a79e05-f46c-491e-bcb5-1166c866c7be -->

## Pathfinder Adventures
Pathfinder Adventures are standalone adventures that cover several levels of play. They're self-contained and typically have a unique structure or theme. You can play through a Pathfinder Adventure on its own or as part of your ongoing campaign–some make ideal side adventures for Adventure Paths that have similar themes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.369,r=0.846,b=0.479), with ID 67b1e93e-2403-4c0c-acc7-ba8840dc3f64 -->

## Pathfinder Society Scenarios
Scenarios are the adventures used by the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program; you can play them as part of the Pathfinder Society or on your own. Each takes about 4 to 5 hours to run, so you can tell a whole story in a short amount of time, but they're also part of a larger continuity and can be combined together to form the basis of a longer campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.491,r=0.851,b=0.617), with ID 24105e6c-9af9-494a-a83f-beee73a4bd40 -->

decisions other players made. These sessions also give
veterans the chance to help less experienced players
through character creation. Lastly, session zero can
give you a better understanding of the characters and
help the players integrate them into the adventure in
interesting ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.648,r=0.860,b=0.739), with ID 800db868-1d7f-487e-978e-7d1d8f120794 -->

# PLANNING A SESSION
A campaign happens over a series of gatherings between
you and the other players, called game sessions. Each
session is usually several hours long, with multiple
encounters, some exploration, and possibly downtime.
Your session can be compared to an episode of a TV
show; it should include some twists, turns, and changes,
and end leaving people excited about what comes next. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.751,r=0.859,b=0.877), with ID 973dcb76-1851-43f6-8dcd-8779383ff893 -->

One of the greatest challenges in gaming is scheduling
a time for everyone to get together and play. Often, this
responsibility falls on you as the GM, since you’re the
one who has to prepare your game between sessions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.878,r=0.860,b=0.938), with ID a1afd8fc-263a-479d-aac5-80315b6ff774 -->

Summary : This is a dramatic fantasy illustration showing a large sailing ship caught in a violent storm at sea, with towering waves, heavy rain, and lightning in the background. The image is used as cover art for the "Pathfinder GM Core" book.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a large, dark-sailed ship struggling against massive, curling ocean waves.
  • The ship is tilted at a steep angle, with crew members visible on deck bracing themselves or holding onto rigging.
  • The background features a turbulent, stormy sky with a prominent lightning bolt illuminating the left side.
  • The color palette is dominated by dark blues, greens, and purples, emphasizing the stormy, perilous atmosphere.
  • The upper left corner includes a stylized dragon illustration and the "Pathfinder GM Core" title.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible rain streaks, foaming water, and intricate ship rigging.
  • No on-image UI elements or additional text beyond the book title.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The ship occupies the lower right and central portion of the image, with the bow facing leftward into the waves.
  • The largest wave is cresting on the right, threatening to engulf the ship.
  • Lightning and the brightest part of the sky are on the left, providing dramatic backlighting.
  • The dragon illustration and title are in the upper left, separated from the main scene by a border.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of danger, chaos, and high adventure, fitting for a fantasy roleplaying game.
  • The composition draws the viewer’s eye from the lightning on the left, across the stormy sea, to the imperiled ship and its crew.
  • The use of dark colors and dynamic lines (rain, waves, rigging) enhances the feeling of movement and urgency. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.003,r=0.995,b=0.521), with ID cea69202-f2f1-4edb-8d07-187d38cec3dc -->

Many games have a set schedule, such as once per
week, once every 2 weeks, or once per month. The less
frequently your group meets, the better notes and recaps
you’ll need to keep everyone on the same page. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.541,r=0.514,b=0.602), with ID 5290e038-93cc-4a94-8ccf-ceaa6df3d8a5 -->

Plan a time for everybody to arrive, and also try to
set a time when playing the game will begin. This can
make it easier for everyone to finish chatting, catching
up, and eating in a timely fashion so you can start
playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also
fairly important. A typical game session lasts about 4
hours, though some groups hold 2-hour sessions or play
marathon games. Less than 2 hours usually isn’t enough
time to get much done in most Pathfinder campaigns.
If your session will be longer than 2 hours, plan out
some 15-minute breaks (in addition to bathroom and
beverage breaks, which players can take as needed). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.603,r=0.514,b=0.786), with ID d6760697-27e4-4b0c-8b93-dc4035a20270 -->

RUNNING A SESSION
During a session, you’re in charge of keeping the game’s
action moving, managing the different modes of play,
fielding questions, and making rules decisions. You’ll
also want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can
end when most convenient for the group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.796,r=0.513,b=0.892), with ID ff5fd8e0-d8bc-4f17-8440-9335661fadb0 -->

You’re the interface between the rules and the imagined world you and the other players share. They will ask you questions, and they’ll act based on their <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.893,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 563d8620-dedd-4b86-a74b-7c2d453d0f32 -->

own assumptions. It’s up to you to establish what’s true
in the world, but you don’t do this unilaterally. You’re
informed by the setting’s backstory, your preparations,
and the suggestions and assumptions the other players
bring to the table. Keep in mind that until you announce
something, your own plans are subject to change. For
example, if you originally intended the owner of a
tavern to be kindly and well-intentioned, but a player
misreads her and invents an interesting conspiracy
theory regarding her intentions that sounds fun, you
might convert the tavern owner into an agent of evil
after all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.542,r=0.904,b=0.723), with ID 60ae4b32-07f7-4d40-9333-366753c7abea -->

You’ll also determine when PCs and foes need to attempt checks, as well as the consequences of those rolls. This comes up most often outside of encounters, as encounters are more regimented about when checks happen and how they are resolved. In an encounter, a player can usually determine their own character’s turn, with you chiming in only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the environment requires a character to attempt a check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.725,r=0.904,b=0.862), with ID 95049829-e505-4fb8-9dc7-ea5dba73c425 -->

Pacing Game Sessions

by challenges such as intense encounters, puzzle-based
exploration, and investigation. Presenting players with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.875,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 6708543c-bae1-450d-81a2-53f6d3d3871d -->

a variety of such obstacles can help them feel more
engaged at the table. Information flow matters, too.
If the group meets a large number of NPCs in short
order, that can make it harder for them to remember
individuals. It helps to break things up into smaller
scenes and memorable moments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.080,r=0.471,b=0.172), with ID 8e03210b-b906-43aa-b57e-e28558303a17 -->

Knowing when to end a session takes practice. About
20 minutes before a play session is scheduled to conclude,
it can be beneficial to figure out how you’d like to end. It
can be memorable to end with a cliffhanger—a moment
so curious and abrupt it raises questions about what
happens next. Examples include ending play before
combat, when the PCs find vital information, or as
they discover treasure. Doing so can inspire the PCs to
discuss the game between sessions. Note anything that
could be satisfying to resolve over media, such as email.
This could include divvying up treasure, leveling up, or
completing downtime tasks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.173,r=0.471,b=0.357), with ID bc0ad1d5-0070-4b55-b7f5-a32d9988919c -->

Starting a Session  
Once everyone is ready, get everyone’s attention and cover the following topics. These are in a rough order that you can change based on your group’s style or a session’s needs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.368,r=0.470,b=0.447), with ID 7609306d-4f98-443b-84eb-920b9d769a69 -->

- • Recap what happened during the previous sessions.
- • Establish where the characters are at the beginning of this session. Have they been resting since their last challenge? Are they in a hallway, preparing to raid the next room of a dungeon? Tell players whether their characters had time to rest or recover since the last session.
- • Remind players that they each have 1 Hero Point at the start of the session.
- • Establish goals. The players should have an idea of what they want to do next. Reestablish any goals the group already had, then let the players weigh in on whether these goals still apply, and on whether there’s anything else they hope to accomplish in this session.
- • Commence adventuring! Decide which mode of play you’re going to start in, then lead off with a verbal prompt to get the action started. You might ask a question related to a particular character, have everyone immediately roll initiative as a monster attacks, or briefly describe the environment and sensations that surround the player characters, allowing them to react. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.102,t=0.449,r=0.472,b=0.802), with ID fb42afbc-78c0-4b69-b3d3-8424d0ffd3dd -->

The Spotlight
As you run the game, keep track of who has the spotlight. It can be easy to keep attention on the most outgoing player or character, but you need to check in with all the players. If a player hasn’t contributed in some time, stop and ask, “What’s your character doing at this point?” If the player’s not sure, add a detail or nonplayer character to the scene that the player might find interesting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.811,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID b81e9d75-9961-4192-93b9-6414b9f9cad7 -->

## SHARING RESPONSIBILITY
Just because you're the GM and ostensibly in charge doesn't mean you have to do all the extra work to make the campaign run. Some of the tasks described here, like scheduling games, taking notes, and giving recaps, can be delegated to other players. You might also have someone track initiative or the Hit Points of the PCs' foes for you in encounters, or even run those foes if you have a large group and someone would rather do that than control a character of their own. It's also great when someone else can host a session, provide snacks for the group, or take on other responsibilities that aren't directly related to the game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.085,r=0.850,b=0.294), with ID a68b7293-a1af-4513-aedf-f68deb86e3ca -->

It’s best to figure out a schedule of responsibilities when you’re first setting up a game. Ask the players what they’re willing to take on. If you start to feel overwhelmed partway through a campaign, you can revisit the topic and try out new options until you find a setup that’s comfortable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.296,r=0.848,b=0.372), with ID 42f6437b-4fbe-4c23-a8f7-14cc4cb751ae -->

Stakes and Consequences
A GM should always convey a clear picture of the stakes and consequences of the PCs’ actions or inaction. What horrible things will happen if the PCs fail? What can they achieve if they go beyond what’s expected of them? A well-constructed adventure conveys the stakes at the outset, but it’s also important to remind the players of those stakes throughout play. A game where the stakes are extremely high all the time cuts out the opportunity for low-key scenes, and can be overwhelming or even monotonous. In most games, players enjoy having some scenes where their characters can relax and socialize with low stakes as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.399,r=0.861,b=0.601), with ID c0adff3d-cd49-40c7-995f-200d14c89910 -->

Consequences should be specific and evocative. Don’t
just tell the players what happened after success or
failure; let their characters witness it in the world. Are
they greeted as heroes by townsfolk? Does the bastion
of evil crack and shudder, falling apart as the PCs
escape? Does a failure lead to the death of an ally and a
somber funeral? It’s usually best if the PCs can foresee
the consequences, at least in a general sense. If a villain
demonstrates their intention to conquer a city, and the
PCs don’t stop them, then the city gets conquered. It’s
OK if you have an idea for an interesting subversion
occasionally, but keep those to a minimum or the chain
of cause and effect will become too muddy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.603,r=0.861,b=0.801), with ID 41415837-b30c-4af8-b17f-0a6291276858 -->

Failing Forward  
Unexpected failure can bring the game to a halt, particularly during exploration. “Failing forward” means finding a way to progress the story instead of saying, “That didn’t work.” This doesn’t mean the group can’t fail, or that the PCs should get what they wanted despite failing. Rather, it means that a failure might still impart more information, reveal a way to improve their <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.814,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 5e3e1e14-d39a-4de8-bef5-cc34c0fdeaaf -->

## HERO POINTS
As GM, you're in charge of doling out Hero Points during sessions. Recommendations for how to grant them appear on page 57, but you can also consider Hero Points a way to reinforce your personal style of Game Mastering and reward what you and the other players value during play. It can help to keep a Hero Point token on hand as a visual and tactile reminder to hand them out when appropriate. You can also asking your players to tell you when they think a PC's action merits a Hero Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.142,t=0.081,r=0.511,b=0.276), with ID 0bc1dc9f-f049-4176-b287-c942d841ebc2 -->

chances next time, or even cause unforeseen difficulties.
Doing so means the player’s choice to attempt a check
*mattered*, even if the results weren’t what they wanted.
Allowing the PCs to fail forward means fewer dead ends
and perfunctory checks. It’s important, however, not to
put unnecessary pressure on yourself to do so all the
time. Sometimes you won’t know immediately how a PC
can fail forward, and in those cases, it’s usually best to
just move on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.294,r=0.515,b=0.434), with ID e9df2d29-35c7-4220-98f6-5f79f3e5a444 -->

**Improvisation**  
As a GM, you often make things up on the fly. You can find tips for improvising rules within the Adjudicating Rules section of this book (page 15). When an issue seems to pertain to the story instead of the rules, ask yourself the following questions.

- Does something already established in our story so far tell me what should happen here?
- What would the NPC’s personality lead them to do?
- What does the player expect to happen?
- What would best fit the themes of our story? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.444,r=0.515,b=0.618), with ID 6c3bd1b1-350a-45ab-b51e-792f59de3f27 -->

You might not have a good answer for every question,
but asking them can inspire useful solutions. If what you
need to invent is significant in the storyline or world,
there’s nothing wrong with asking the group to take a
little break while you fill in the gap. If it’s not particularly
significant and you can’t come up with anything more
compelling, it’s also okay to say “Nothing happens” and
move on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.632,r=0.514,b=0.754), with ID 7363574b-23a6-4c1d-ac3b-bb786569b042 -->

Often, a player will ask, “What happens when I do that?” This is a good indicator that the player expects that what they’ve done will draw a reaction from an NPC or the environment. Unless the player is way off base, provide an in-game response, even if it’s minor. The player has telegraphed what matters to them, and the perceived importance of their action can draw them into the game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.755,r=0.514,b=0.878), with ID ab8c98b0-8612-4cb3-9cf0-13a6e723c86b -->

Special Circumstances  
The player characters in your group will at times attempt tasks that should be easier or harder than the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.889,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID 85c6ce50-c6a5-450a-8785-e24a3c6bdddc -->

rules or adventure would otherwise lead you to expect,
such as a PC Gathering Information in their hometown.
In these cases, you can just apply a circumstance bonus
or penalty. Usually, this is +1 or –1 for a minor but
significant circumstance, but you can adjust this bonus
or penalty to +2 or –2 for a major circumstance. The
maximum bonus or penalty, +4 or –4, should apply only
if someone has an overwhelming advantage or is trying
something extremely unlikely but not quite impossible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.081,r=0.905,b=0.218), with ID 3d0429f1-1a7b-4c19-be38-b52833991c2e -->

You can also add traits to actions. Let’s say that during a fight against a fire elemental, Seelah Interacts to pour water from her waterskin on her sword. You could add the water trait to her next Strike so Seelah can take advantage of the fire elemental’s weakness to water. A PC getting an advantage in this way should usually have to use an action to do so, so Seelah would get the benefit for one attack, but to do it again she’d need to use her waterskin once more. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.219,r=0.905,b=0.356), with ID 22c097a8-ad34-4a94-8344-dfed41d2a878 -->

False Information  
A critical failure to Recall Knowledge can result in you needing to convey false information, requiring some improvisation. If you aren’t careful, this information can be perceived by the PCs as too silly or could derail the game. For example, if a PC misinterpreted text about the god of commerce, Abadar, telling them that they now believe the god is an incompetent chaotic spendthrift who’s bad with money might be too far-fetched. Similarly, if they incorrectly believe Abadar will reward them with great wealth if they ring bells in four different temple corners, this could send them on a tangent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.369,r=0.904,b=0.555), with ID b618e87d-17ed-428d-9c87-9e9b03285c58 -->

Providing false information can cause the PCs to make mistakes, but the consequences should typically be immediate rather than continual or far in the future. Avoid dispensing false information that might not be used for hours or entire sessions after the check is forgotten. If you’re unsure, the safest form of false information is information that’s wrong but not in a way that causes major consequences. Remember that a critical failure says you get incorrect information, not that you get important-seeming false information. Erroneously believing Abadar’s symbol is a set of scales instead of a key might lead to a miscommunication, but one that’s not dangerous, easy to clear up, and only a little embarrassing for the PC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.557,r=0.905,b=0.755), with ID 9f58dcef-0c5d-41ad-96b3-3741cde1fdd2 -->

Secret Checks  
During play, you roll some checks in secret instead of allowing the player to do so, as explained on page 405 of Player Core. This rule helps ensure that a player remains uncertain at times when their character is unsure of how a situation may resolve, immersing the player in their character’s perspective. It can be handy to keep a list of the PCs’ modifiers on hand to help you roll secret checks more quickly. At least, you should record each player’s Perception modifier, their saving throw modifiers (especially Will), and the skill modifiers of any skills they <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.767,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID daeb71db-b04e-4605-b622-2adf8c95e317 -->

12 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.017,t=0.959,r=0.084,b=0.983), with ID 675b943e-0ed0-42ee-a649-c9bc4f7e471b -->

Running the Game <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.660,t=0.018,r=0.867,b=0.044), with ID c7e6b49a-92a0-4e38-b0e9-ef907fcb4abc -->

often use to Recall Knowledge. Check in anytime the PCs
level up, and consider asking the players to update you
when any of these modifiers change. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.080,r=0.469,b=0.127), with ID 0ea5b5a8-16f4-4ec2-a252-d78a5f40ec96 -->

You can still have the players roll the checks even if an action has the secret trait. This is usually best done when the results are going to be immediate or when stakes are low, like when the PC is trying to recall something during downtime that they’ll see is false through the course of their research. You can instead have the players handle all their rolls, secret or otherwise. This works best when the group is interested in leaning into the dramatic irony of knowing a PC is wrong and playing up their characters’ mistakes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.127,r=0.470,b=0.266), with ID 2b6623fe-5107-403e-9e81-2d9967bda065 -->

Metagaming
Knowledge the players have that their characters don’t is often called “metagame knowledge,” and using it to influence characters’ decisions is called “metagaming.” Some metagaming results naturally from play and is wise to disregard. The wizard aiming a fireball precisely enough to include three enemies in the very edge of the spell’s area is probably unrealistic, but isn’t that disruptive to play. Things get more questionable if the player says something like “That’s a rakshasa, so don’t use divine spells against it.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.276,r=0.471,b=0.447), with ID 01608062-c89b-4d57-84a0-717b08de0c20 -->

—regardless of whether their character has
encountered a rakshasa before or identified the
creature. Each group is different, and the assumption
of what the characters know varies. If metagaming starts
to get out of hand, you might use some gentle reminders,
like “I’m not sure your character’s aware of that” or “Can
you explain your character’s thinking when they do that?”
If the problem persists, see the guidelines mentioned in the
Problematic Players section on page 18. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.450,r=0.470,b=0.587), with ID 0cc5588e-8d77-4640-b1c6-1342c91fff7a -->

Roleplaying NPCs
Although the PCs are the stars of the game, NPCs make the world around the PCs vibrant. They can become a part of the story, sometimes for years, weaving into the story right alongside the PCs. Portray NPCs however it works best for you. Some GMs keep it simple, describing the NPCs simply by their looks or their hook (see below). Others go into more detail, using accents, mannerisms, or acting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.597,r=0.469,b=0.723), with ID 28b3edc5-d2ff-4dc1-9b3a-9ca02682403a -->

Because NPCs have smaller roles than PCs, imparting
enough information to convey their identities while they
interact with the party can be challenging. When you
create an NPC, start by integrating a single “hook” into
their concept: a widowed merchant, a refugee from a
distant realm, or a child who constantly asks awkward
questions. Each hints at a backstory but is easily described
in a synopsis. If the NPC continues to interact with the
party, you can then add to their backstory later. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.725,r=0.469,b=0.862), with ID 5f42b5e5-8e20-41aa-ad46-45ea0605ad62 -->

NPCs from adventures and other sourcebooks often
include basic information about their personality,
gender, and role in the game. Important NPCs often
include more in-depth roleplaying tips, personal edicts,
anathemas, and more. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.863,r=0.469,b=0.938), with ID 878a456f-24c1-43c8-9bc4-09950c081eed -->

NPC Limitations
Always remember that the PCs have the greatest role in your story. Avoid including allied NPCs who could easily solve any problem the PCs encounter. An extremely powerful NPC should be engaged with matters beyond what the PCs are tasked with or have some limitation that necessitates the PCs’ involvement. Remember that an NPC is not “your character” in the way each player has a character. Though NPCs who travel with the party can be effective and fun when handled with caution, an NPC who effectively acts as the GM’s character is often called a GMPC (Game Master Player Character) and can contribute to a feeling that the players are being coerced into making certain decisions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.078,r=0.861,b=0.295), with ID ee8e902f-aec7-4079-a246-3c0c82283ba9 -->

## OFF-SESSION GAMING
Session play with a full group isn’t the only way to play Pathfinder. Finding opportunities to expand on the game outside of its regular schedule can keep your group engaged between sessions.

You can get together with a single player to run a mini-session for their character, covering a mission that’s important to their story but doesn’t concern the rest of the group. You and the players can work out what their characters do during solid stretches of downtime via e-mail or chat messages. You can also give players opportunities to collaborate on details of the story, like having a player design a heraldic symbol for the adventuring group or map out their home base. You might even decide to award a Hero Point at the next session to a player for events that happened outside a session.

Some events aren’t suitable for handling outside of sessions. Any event that strongly affects a character whose player isn’t present should be handled at the table when everyone can attend. It’s also helpful to recap events that took place outside of the session for all characters so no one feels excluded or lost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.146,t=0.090,r=0.896,b=0.265), with ID db4e661b-afbf-46b3-bab0-08f5b26f28d9 -->

  • The figure is centered and shown in a three-quarters view, facing slightly to the left.
  • The shield is held forward, partially obscuring the left side of the body, while the sword is held downward in the right hand.
  • The crossbow and quiver are visible over the left shoulder, with arrows fanned out.

Analysis :
  • The visual message emphasizes the character’s preparedness, strength, and versatility in combat, with both defensive (shield, armor) and offensive (sword, crossbow, arrows) equipment.
  • The ornate armor and fantasy motifs suggest a heroic or elite status within a fantasy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.126,t=0.369,r=0.529,b=0.871), with ID 38089a4e-c5c4-4602-87a0-1c2e6c08755a -->

set up to betray the party in some way, lay groundwork
early on so the players don’t feel ambushed by the twist.
If the players can look back and see a clear path to this
result, it’s likely they’ll feel the decision makes sense in
the context of the story. Try to give the NPC a “tell” or
a paper trail that can be found, especially one where the
players have chances to pick up on that tell with smart
use of their abilities and skills. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.297,r=0.904,b=0.419), with ID 450e62b1-969a-4d73-94c9-85a009783d61 -->

Respecting the Character
Sometimes when creating characters, a GM can unintentionally play into themes that can be harmful or hurtful. For example, an NPC with a background of abuse, a former or current slave, or a character with disabilities requires respectful handling. This is particularly true if you, as the GM, do not have the same life experience as the NPC in question. If you want to include these themes for an NPC, you should probably bring it up with your players beforehand and set expectations. You don’t need to spoil the character, but sitting down and checking in with your players can help prevent unpleasant surprises and is better than assuming. To keep the representation respectful, avoid cliches and don’t use the hook as a joke. Your group’s guidelines for objectionable content can also help you portray NPCs respectfully. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.430,r=0.904,b=0.707), with ID 38aeeb98-e3d9-4356-b995-56e1b52ffb4f -->

A Proper End  
An NPC’s story should have a satisfying ending. The NPC might leave your story when they achieve a major goal, go on to other adventures, give up their dream, or die. The death of a beloved NPC should have weight. Make it sympathetic and powerful, and ideally have it take place “on stage” with the PCs present. Be prepared that NPC deaths might stir up strong emotions within the group, and be prepared to cut the session short or to fade to black to mitigate the full brunt of the event if necessary. An NPC’s death should matter beyond the PCs’ emotions or search for revenge, too—maybe the NPC’s sacrifice saved a village or inspired others. Let players see that legacy carried on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.721,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 1d2ae5f7-6336-41be-b3bf-86b6874fb01d -->

# Adjudicating Rules
As Game Master, it falls on you to adjudicate the rules. This means you’re making judgments and decisions about the rules, especially when their application is unclear. Roleplaying games encourage creativity, and however well crafted and well tested a set of rules is, players will always find situations that require interpretation and judgment by the GM. You need at least some familiarity with the rules to run a game well, but you don’t need to be the foremost expert on the rules. You don’t even need to know the most about the rules at your table to be a great GM! There’s a key difference between “knowing” the rules and “adjudicating” the rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.490,r=0.471,b=0.694), with ID 81e04dfc-aa43-4f1c-9608-f1e83d63bf4e -->

While GMing, strive to make quick, fair, and consistent
rulings. Your rulings should encourage your group to
work together to interpret the rules and be creative with
their characters’ decisions and actions. If your group
is satisfied with the interpretation, you’ve made the
right adjudication! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.694,r=0.471,b=0.787), with ID 86986ae0-c820-4977-9dcb-af61eb986ffe -->

## The Basics
The following are some basic guidelines for adjudicating rules in play—these are the same principles that Pathfinder’s game rules are based on. You might want to keep printouts of these guidelines and the DC guidelines (page 53) for quick reference.

- • If you don’t know how long a quick task takes, go with 1 action, or 2 actions if a character shouldn’t be able to perform it three times per round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.797,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID bfab0c76-c1d0-45ad-8053-118ac40b85eb -->

- • If you’re not sure what action a task uses, look for the most similar basic action. If you don’t find one, make up an undefined action and add any necessary traits (usually attack, concentrate, manipulate, or move).
- • When two sides are opposed, have one roll against the other’s DC. Don’t have both sides roll (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).
- • If an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty.
- • If you’re not sure how difficult a significant challenge should be, use the DC for the party’s level.
- • If you’re making up an effect, creatures should be incapacitated or killed on only a critical success (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).
- • If you don’t know what check to use, pick the most appropriate skill. If no other skill applies to a check to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate Lore skill (usually at an untrained proficiency rank).
- • Use the characters’ daily preparations as the time to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.
- • When a character accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn’t have rules for XP, award them XP for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP, as described on page 56).
- • When the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they might fail forward, meaning the story moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.497,t=0.203,r=0.866,b=0.664), with ID 7f78ec98-6275-45cf-aa8e-06a915356e37 -->

Consistency and Fairness  
As an arbiter of the rules and the person who’s setting the scene for the action, it’s in your best interest to appear fair at all times. Your main defense against appearing unfair is consistency in your rulings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.674,r=0.862,b=0.755), with ID 93aebb95-6efd-4c0e-bf57-c9a63ab7cb3f -->

Achieving consistency is as easy as explaining why
you’re ruling a certain way and comparing this ruling to
past rulings you’ve made in a way that makes sense to
your players. For example, you might say something like
“When Torben swung from the chandelier and attacked
the air elemental, I required an Athletics check as part
of the action and gave a +1 circumstance bonus to the
attack roll. Hanging from the rope bridge to attack
the giant bat sounds similar, so why don’t you roll an
Athletics check.” Do this any time it’s applicable when
you make a ruling, but don’t feel compelled to do so for
truly new rulings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.756,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 1b9ed44d-57ea-4696-89a8-156bbc3795a3 -->

Through the course of playing, your previous
rulings will form a set of shared preferences and an
understanding between you and your group—or even
become formalized house rules. Over time, your players
will think about these examples when planning their
actions, which can improve consistency during play. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.078,r=0.514,b=0.174), with ID dc9c2106-1f2d-4620-9fe6-9a9871dac500 -->

Looking Up Rules
Remember that keeping your game moving is more
important than being 100% correct. At the
same time, it’s perfectly acceptable to refer
to the rules during a session. However, you
don’t have to do this alone. If you’re leafing
through a book or searching an electronic
reference, your players are idle. There are a few
techniques that make these intervals more
palatable for the players. Letting them know
that you’re looking something up might
prompt some players to also read the rule.
This can increase the chances of collaboration
and sets expectations for the length of the
pause. Alerting your players that you’re
going to take a minute and read the rules also
lets them know that it’s a good time to tend
to away-from-the-table tasks like refilling
a drink. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.183,r=0.486,b=0.480), with ID 228e7703-2323-4db3-ba6e-c5a4e90d471c -->

Listen to the Players  
The friends around your game table are perhaps your best tool for achieving quick, fair, and consistent rulings. Sharing the task of remembering the rules makes rules discussions collaborative rather than combative, greatly increases the chances of accurate and comprehensive recall of the written rules and your own past rulings, and is true to the shared storytelling spirit of Pathfinder. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.490,r=0.454,b=0.662), with ID 38e83829-365b-43b2-ac2e-3e78771dac00 -->

Asking if anyone knows how a specific rule rewards those players who have spent time mastering the rules and involves more people in the discussion. It signals to other players that you are willing to hear opinions before making a ruling, and it builds a more collaborative environment. In addition, for groups with access to a large number of sourcebooks or rules resources, you can ask different players to examine separate sources. This can greatly increase the speed and accuracy of a group’s rulings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.663,r=0.515,b=0.817), with ID 17571902-fa9d-4261-a7be-d389d5bfb6b2 -->

Approaching the rules as a group problem also means that you should never trivialize player concerns about a rule. You must also think about each player and assess how important the rules actually are to them. Remember, though—while rules recall is a group challenge, making the final decision on the rules interpretation and getting the session moving again falls to you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.817,r=0.514,b=0.939), with ID 0336ca60-2280-432b-9bb1-5c9dab4bff54 -->

Make the Call  
Though all the above are great practices for making good rulings, often the best ruling is the one that keeps the game moving. Avoid getting so bogged down that it takes you several minutes to decide what ruling you’ll proceed with. Take what’s close enough and keep playing. If necessary, you can tell your group “This is how we’re playing it now, but we can have more discussion between sessions.” This gets you back in the action, puts a clear stamp on the fact that this is your decision in the moment, and empowers your players with permission to express their opinions on the ruling at a later time. When in doubt, rule in favor of the player’s request, and then review the situation later. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.325), with ID 7a6af7d7-8284-453e-85dd-f5822713d31a -->

The best time to really go in-depth, possibly
putting the group on a short break, is when
a situation is life-or-death or has major
consequences in a character’s story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.607,t=0.325,r=0.904,b=0.389), with ID 126ef69c-113f-4164-9635-264f05ccb2ef -->

Take Time for Review  
When you make a decision you’re not sure about, look back over it at the end of a session or between sessions. You might change your mind—there’s nothing wrong with that! If you change or clarify your original ruling, inform your players before the next session. No one likes being surprised by a rule change. Even better, include them in a rules conversation just like you might during a session. The guidance on discussing rules with your players still applies between sessions. Unlike at-the-table rules discussions, there’s also much more time in these situations to read existing official rulings or sources. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.581,t=0.398,r=0.905,b=0.632), with ID 6f24327d-9a8b-43f1-a70e-18ba2385a5c2 -->

Saying “Yes, But”

Some of the most memorable moments come from situations that inherently call for a rules interpretation, like when a player wants to do something creative using the environment. The variety of these situations is limited only by the imagination of your players. It’s usually better to say “yes” than “no,” within reason. For example, imagine a player wants to do something borderline nonsensical like grabbing a spider and squeezing it to force it to use its web attack. But what about a player who wants to use a fire spell to deliberately ignite a barrel of oil? Surely that should have some effect! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.642,r=0.904,b=0.831), with ID e0796589-23bc-432d-b394-d924008335b6 -->

This is where you can use a variant of the well-known
improv “Yes, and,” technique: you can say “Yes, but.”
With “Yes, but,” you allow the player’s creative idea,
but tie it into the world and the game rules via some
sort of additional consequences, potentially adding the
uncertainty of an additional roll. Here are some simple
ways you might implement this tool: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.832,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 4bd3bd77-d57a-40a5-9e49-f7efb91ec8c3 -->

16 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.032,t=0.959,r=0.084,b=0.983), with ID 0771d995-3016-411a-bca7-bf73e5bb3260 -->

- • Get a fleeting benefit without a roll. Example: dip a sword into a burning brazier to add 1 fire damage on the next attack against a troll.
- • Require a check, then apply a circumstance bonus to the PC’s action. Example: swing from a chandelier above a foe.
- • Require a check, then apply a circumstance penalty or condition to a foe. Example: throw a barrel over a monster’s head.
- • Require an attack roll or skill check to deal minor damage and gain another benefit. Examples: jump from a higher elevation down onto a foe for a small amount of damage, potentially knocking the foe prone; throw sand in an opponent’s eyes.
- • Require a directed attack against an object, then allow foes to attempt saving throws against the object’s effect at a DC you choose. Example: cast an *ignition* spell at a barrel of explosives. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.079,r=0.473,b=0.356), with ID b5ffb2d9-be59-48e8-b796-b59999159c26 -->

Another powerful tool you can use to help you say “Yes,
but” when you’re unsure of the game impact is to allow the
idea to work just this once, letting your players know that
this is part of your decision. For instance, maybe you think
a PC’s attempt to Grapple a spider to aim its web attack at
another foe is so fun you have to let them do it, but you’re
worried that the effect would be so powerful
that the PCs would just carry around a spider
to shoot webs for the rest of the campaign. By
making it a one-time effect, you can have fun but
don’t have to worry about whether you’re setting a
disruptive precedent for later on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.357,r=0.469,b=0.542), with ID c7901843-4391-4d4f-828d-ff5644d285e5 -->

House Rules
You and your players will inevitably
come across a rule you disagree with or that runs
counter to the theme of your game. You might even
decide to add a specific rule to an area not covered by
the written rules. Collectively, these rulings, changes,
and additions are known as house rules. It’s a good idea
to record them in a place where the group can easily
access and refer to them, and where a potential new
player could find them. Such record-keeping is a great
thing to delegate to a player! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.549,r=0.471,b=0.724), with ID 06dd0800-b035-46f4-bdd8-487c9437256e -->

The best rule of thumb in these situations is to be slow to change the written rules and quick to revert a problematic ruling or house rule. The simple reason for this is that sticking to the written rules is the easiest way to remain fair and consistent. However, the more you learn your group’s play style, the more often you’ll find times where you and your group feel it’s correct to institute a house rule of some sort. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.724,r=0.470,b=0.848), with ID 45c1b361-473e-46cc-8781-1e2ad775207f -->

# RESOLVING PROBLEMS
Being a Game Master and running a game can be a tremendously rewarding and fulfilling experience: you get to sit down with friends old and new, roll some dice, tell stories, and have fun. That said, being a GM <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.857,r=0.471,b=0.942), with ID 42d2ec53-4242-4786-9bd3-d3fb4286c61a -->

and running a game can present unique challenges.
When dealing with problems at the table, keep in mind
the primary reason to play Pathfinder is to have fun.
And that’s true for everyone—player or GM. Don’t
“solve” a problem by reducing everyone’s enjoyment
of the game or their ability to forge a path for their
characters. Of course, sometimes your solution might
not make everyone deliriously happy. Play style is very
personal and individualized; rarely does a group agree
on all things all the time. Solving problems can be as
collaborative as the rest of the game. It’s not a good idea
for a GM to ignore the players’ opinions—but that said,
the final decision in resolving a problem rests with you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.079,r=0.863,b=0.282), with ID 3e9b0051-94c2-4a9f-b841-91a6cbe21550 -->

**Distractions and Interruptions**  
Maintaining the players’ attention keeps a game moving and leads to memorable moments when everyone’s in the same zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.290,r=0.863,b=0.358), with ID 7a45a892-cbcc-4d92-8826-33bc11f18aec -->

  • The motif is decorative, possibly part of a border or header, and uses symmetry and contrast to create visual interest. The use of green and brown with gold outlines suggests a classic or fantasy-inspired aesthetic. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.896,t=0.894,r=1.000,b=0.934), with ID 6edd92c4-f89c-44ec-8d46-777c9e6b9a5e -->

# CHEATING
Players rarely cheat knowingly, so if you suspect a player of cheating, it’s safe to assume first that they’re unaware of—or simply forgot—how an aspect of the rules works. A gentle reminder of how the rule, spell, or ability in question functions is usually enough to move past the situation. Every once in a great while, you’ll encounter a player who is deliberately cheating. The spirit of roleplaying is one of cooperative storytelling and overcoming challenges together, so one player cheating steals fun from every other player at the table. It’s natural to feel some anger in this situation, so make sure you let some time pass between when you discover that a player is cheating and when you address it with them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.147,t=0.090,r=0.503,b=0.309), with ID e8334d76-65b0-4ac7-8acc-75c0d8ef0762 -->

Ultimately, it will fall to you as the GM to gently make
it clear that this behavior must stop. To do this well,
think carefully about why the player is cheating before
approaching them. The reason behind the cheating often
points to a reasonable solution. When discussing the
matter with your player, do your best to remain calm and
inquisitive rather than accusatory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.310,r=0.505,b=0.419), with ID 9c323c70-c5e8-4dce-8613-2387799358f8 -->

This is fine in moderation. A game is a social gathering, so there’s definitely a place for conversation that’s not directly related to playing the game. These interruptions become a problem if they’re too frequent, or if people are talking over others. If a player repeatedly interrupts you or other people or undercuts every crucial moment of the game with a joke, talk to them about limiting their comments to appropriate times. Often, all you need to do is hold up your hand or otherwise indicate that the player is talking out of turn to delay them until after you or another speaker finishes talking. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.448,r=0.514,b=0.616), with ID 81a6fc07-4bad-4803-a722-f53424044c64 -->

Phones and other mobile devices are another major
source of distraction. Banning them entirely is often
impractical—many players use apps to roll dice or manage
their character sheets, or they need to answer texts from
their partner, check in on a work project, or otherwise stay
connected with people who rely on them. However, you
can set ground rules against using a device for anything
that’s not time-sensitive or game-related, such as refreshing
social media, checking the score of a hockey game, playing
a mobile game, or answering a non-urgent text. You can
relax these rules for players when their characters are
“offstage.” If a player’s character isn’t in a scene, that might
be a good time for the player to use a mobile device. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.618,r=0.513,b=0.817), with ID 6e32b76b-34fc-471d-a7d6-9004c3b1f075 -->

**Problematic Players**  
Most players who cause problems do so unintentionally—perhaps bringing out-of-game issues and stresses to the table. You shouldn’t immediately jump on every instance of problematic play—everyone has a bad night on occasion. However, if someone disrupts the game on an ongoing basis, you owe it to all the players to deal with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.828,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID dae81d09-b508-4534-ad04-172f64709118 -->

the problem. If you don’t, bad feelings, grudges, and even
ruined friendships could result. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.903,b=0.111), with ID 6717980b-0f42-460a-a3d0-0d0dc05cdc7a -->

Handling a problematic player requires tact: making
demands in front of the rest of the group is rarely the best
way to resolve the problem. Attempt to handle the problem
privately away from the game, or call a break to have a
private conversation if the situation is really urgent. As
with all emotionally charged conversations, email, text
messages, and the like can lose the subtlety of speech—it's
better to meet the player face-to-face, if possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.112,r=0.903,b=0.234), with ID a54c5b79-f1da-440e-8765-d187dc8c6c81 -->

- • Obsessing over the letter of the rules.
- • Constantly “helping” other players make the optimal choice on their turn.
- • Making their character the center of attention without allowing space for other players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.235,r=0.904,b=0.340), with ID 10c3d3f2-9a7e-4ee7-b2fc-b7c4cc39011a -->

- • Repeatedly arguing with decisions made by other players or the GM.
- • Ignoring other players’ opinions.
- • Deliberately derailing the adventure’s plot.
- • Being deliberately rude or cruel to other players—especially if it’s on the basis of their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation, the color of their skin, or the like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.342,r=0.903,b=0.524), with ID 92262244-53f0-4c76-b5e6-639dbe81427b -->

Safety Tools
Introducing and using safety tools at your table can help head off some problematic behaviors. The X-Card and Lines and Veils tools described on page 7 allow anyone who feels uncomfortable or unsafe to express their discomfort, with clear guidance on how the rest of the table should respond. This clarity sets obvious boundaries to help enforce the social rules of the table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.538,r=0.903,b=0.663), with ID b532abe4-8c82-4748-aabf-1f656d5df9c6 -->

Ejecting a Player  
Ultimately, there’s no place for a serially or deliberately disruptive player in your gaming group. Such behavior is not fair to you or the other players, and the problematic player needs to either modify their behavior or leave the group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.676,r=0.903,b=0.769), with ID a40c028b-ba78-431d-b70c-fb4dcfb24c09 -->

Before meeting with the problematic player, discuss
the situation with the other players in private to ensure
you make the right call and figure out what repercussions
you expect and whether the game should continue at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.771,r=0.902,b=0.832), with ID 483b2807-15fa-456c-a7c7-da9658f3694d -->

When you break the news to the problematic player,
be compassionate but firmly state the decision is final
and restate which behaviors are responsible. If parts of
having the player in the game were rewarding or you
want the player to remain a friend, make that clear and
decide if a player’s behavior merits other changes to
your relationship. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.833,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 794a95a3-1d99-4b6d-9cd7-538c3bae4967 -->

Power Imbalances  
You might end up with one PC who outshines everyone else. Perhaps the player is a rules expert with a powerful character, other players are less experienced or more focused on the story of their characters, or there’s just a rules combination or item that’s stronger than you expected. In any case, this imbalance might mean you have other players who feel ineffective, or the overpowered character’s player becomes bored because they aren’t challenged during gameplay. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.075,r=0.472,b=0.234), with ID 1c9fbfdf-357b-47bb-9cf9-f0fce1b81b9e -->

Talk to the player between sessions, and make it clear
that no one at the table is to blame in this situation.
Most players have no problem making some concessions
for the happiness of the group. If the problem results
from rules options, offer an easy way to retrain. If the
imbalance resulted from an item, come up with a way
that item might need to be lost or sacrificed, but in a
satisfying way that furthers the narrative. If you meet
resistance from the player, listen to their counterpoints.
If you’re still convinced they need to change, you might
need to be more firm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.234,r=0.471,b=0.402), with ID 8fed5e3a-33ed-433b-a46b-081004874fe6 -->

It’s worth stating that players might still have fun, or even enjoy an instance of power imbalance. You don’t have to do anything to address it unless it limits fun at your table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.403,r=0.470,b=0.464), with ID 132e9562-8cba-42c2-8a55-c0415d3a6f03 -->

# NARRATIVE COLLABORATION
The relationship between you, your players, and the story is what makes roleplaying games successful and memorable. If all the players at the table contribute ideas, the game holds more surprises for everyone—including you! While some players like to sit back and let the Game Master control everything, most players want their contributions to shape the campaign’s story. This is central to the concept of player agency—making players feel like the choices they make really matter, and that the world is a living place they can change through their decisions. In some games, the players can step beyond the traditional divide between GM and players to directly influence how the story progresses. Below are three methods you can use to balance the narrative control of your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.474,r=0.470,b=0.724), with ID 1922623e-e794-4f9f-a4fb-ab4b7ce93af3 -->

Idea Farm  
Coming up with ideas for a campaign can sometimes feel overwhelming. This is where your players come in handy! You can solicit direct feedback from them and implement their ideas into the game. This style of narrative control preserve your authority over the game while giving players the chance to incorporate elements into the game you know they want to see. It doesn’t venture beyond the traditional structure of a fantasy roleplaying game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.736,r=0.469,b=0.877), with ID 5e1ba4fb-99f6-4575-9cab-324d9008014b -->

Plan for a few checkpoints throughout the campaign
where you touch base with your players to get their
ideas. The most crucial comes at the start of the game.
It's best to take this step before you even set to work on <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.878,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 800290c0-5e3d-48f0-a58b-7b31d71cb74e -->

crafting the world or plot, so that player input can define
what’s important in the game world. Later, checkpoints
can coincide with major story milestones. For example,
if the players set off across the sea, you might ask where
they want their voyage to end and what sites, if any,
they’d like to explore along the way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.080,r=0.861,b=0.174), with ID c0000e04-0108-45e3-93db-9b93fcddf9bd -->

Creative Collaboration  
You might have players develop the stories of some of the regions or NPCs, while your contributions serve as the glue that makes it all work together. This breaks somewhat with traditional RPG structures, in that you might not be the expert on all areas of the setting and plot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.184,r=0.861,b=0.279), with ID 276e9872-4240-459b-8e10-e17af3bbb181 -->

Your collaboration will depend on the interests of
you and the other players. Maybe one draws a city
map, another makes the stats and personality for an
NPC, another controls some monsters in combat, and
a fourth doesn’t want to do anything beyond playing
their character. There’s a trade-off here, because while
you’ll be off-loading some of your work, you’ll also need
to ensure consistency across these multiple sources of
ideas. It can really help to keep a log of which player
is in charge of each part of your setting. If you expect
one of a player’s specialties to appear in an upcoming
session, let them know ahead of time so they can prepare
or discuss their ideas in advance with you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.281,r=0.860,b=0.479), with ID 8e4ffdd6-1f8f-4794-a080-5a0d5cce0bbd -->

## Decentralized Storytelling
What if you want to go all the way and completely break down the walls between the GM and other players? What if you want to preside over a game in which anyone can speak for any of the NPCs, and when someone tries to determine what’s down the next hallway, it’s just as likely to come from another player as from you? In this approach, one of your biggest jobs is asking questions or giving prompts. “When you open the door, what’s beyond?” “How does the king react to Lem’s taunt?” You can direct your questions to individual players, leave them open to all, and put forth your own suggestions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.491,r=0.861,b=0.677), with ID 1522b59d-7155-4dc4-9851-200b4969e4b0 -->

This approach works best when players are comfortable
with one another and willing to both take responsibility
in building the story and accept that some of their ideas
will go unused. It’s well suited for shorter campaigns, or
ones in which players take turns in the GM’s seat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.679,r=0.861,b=0.755), with ID c19a8e8a-8a18-40e5-a40a-16ab7a370ddf -->

Challenges  
The largest risk of putting narrative control in multiple people’s hands is losing a cohesive story. When multiple people have conflicting ideas about the tone of the game or particulars of the setting, you can end up with something that doesn’t satisfy anyone. One of your tasks as GM is to recap events to clarify and reinforce the shared narrative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.767,r=0.859,b=0.892), with ID 1ca4cda0-13b0-403b-937c-1a9fb13b4c18 -->

Shared narrative control also complicates planning
ahead. The group might need to improvise an encounter,
take a break while you (and maybe other players) prep <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.894,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID a4a7e671-fc75-4168-baaa-771019511961 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing an intense combat scene between adventurers and an undead armored foe, used as cover art for the "Pathfinder GM Core" book.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a dramatic battle in a dungeon-like environment.
  • Foreground: A large, menacing undead warrior in black armor, wielding a massive polearm, dominates the right side.
  • Midground: Two adventurers—one in red and gold armor casting a spell with fire effects, and another in blue and gold holding a glowing object—are engaged in combat with the undead.
  • The setting is dark, with stone floors and walls, illuminated by magical and torchlight.
  • The color palette is rich in dark blues, blacks, and fiery oranges/yellows from magical effects and lighting.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with dynamic lighting effects highlighting the action.
  • The "Pathfinder GM Core" title is visible at the top, with a stylized dragon motif on the left border.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The undead warrior is positioned aggressively, advancing from the right, with his weapon raised.
  • The spellcaster is in the center, recoiling from the attack, with magical fire erupting from their hand.
  • The second adventurer is to the left, slightly behind, providing support with a glowing object.
  • The composition uses diagonal lines and overlapping figures to convey motion and tension.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a high-stakes, action-packed encounter typical of fantasy role-playing games.
  • The use of lighting and color draws attention to the conflict and highlights the magical elements.
  • The arrangement of characters and their poses suggests teamwork and imminent danger, setting the tone for the game content within. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.004,r=0.996,b=0.519), with ID 20a6bca6-6bec-4553-9351-67d090fb04eb -->

to go in a new direction, or even revise their plans. It
helps to limit yourself to creatures that you can quickly
find stats for in *Monster Core* or another monster book
to avoid spending hours of work on creatures you
won’t use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.541,r=0.514,b=0.617), with ID 2eb2f096-8490-4d69-864c-d51479396635 -->

Also, don’t lose sight of your own enjoyment! You
shouldn’t sacrifice how much fun you have for others. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.616,r=0.514,b=0.649), with ID 238a595c-e3a2-46b7-86c5-adc2f0c723c8 -->

Story Points  
If you prefer, you can give players a number of Story Points at the start of each session (typically 2 or 3). They can cash these in to determine what happens next in the story. Having a currency like this means you can keep your steady hand on the tiller while allowing other players to interject when it’s important to them. For most groups, a Story Point should allow the player to suggest a plot twist that can be resolved quickly or to establish a relevant fact or NPC attitude. It can’t determine the outcome of an entire scene or vastly alter the reality of the setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.659,r=0.514,b=0.847), with ID 9e2fdca2-aa14-4d98-b6bf-02cf5a3a5c5a -->

## Group Composition
No two Pathfinder groups are exactly the same. At each
gaming table, the GM and players work together to
find their own style for the game and to tell their own
stories. Some of these differences require the GM to <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.858,r=0.515,b=0.941), with ID 359f9bd5-b838-460a-81f6-fa2037525bd2 -->

make adjustments, especially for groups participating
in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, large or small
groups, and groups in which one or more players has
additional needs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.540,r=0.905,b=0.602), with ID 8fa869cb-5227-49f2-ac09-9ff67a0c2b82 -->

Pathfinder Society Organized Play
The Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign is a thriving, worldwide organization of players and GMs. While most home campaigns provide long-running stories with a consistent group, Pathfinder Society provides adventures designed to be completed in a single game session, so that players can continue their characters’ stories whenever and wherever works best for them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.612,r=0.905,b=0.754), with ID e2fa9c8a-3d35-4ff0-ab6b-168a657c9835 -->

To allow this flexibility while maintaining a fair experience, the Pathfinder Society campaign handles some tasks that are normally in the GM’s purview, such as selecting which rules options are available to PCs. Pathfinder Society GMs are expected to stay true to the adventure as it’s written but are encouraged to allow players to apply creative solutions to the situations they face. For example, PCs may be able to use illusions, bribery, or social skills to bypass a challenge that is presented in the scenario as a combat encounter.

**Unusual Group Sizes**  
The standard group size for Pathfinder assumes four players and a GM. Some additional changes to your GMing strategy might be useful for groups with dramatically fewer or greater players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.074,r=0.472,b=0.160), with ID 6ca6b994-3cac-4e61-8cb2-8450b62e9a39 -->

Small Groups
Small-group games focus more intently on the interests of the players and their characters, allowing for an experience that can be more customizable for each individual. However, they can also run into trouble when the PCs have gaps in their abilities. In many cases, the easiest way to adjust for a small group is to add additional characters. This could come in the form of allowing each player to play two characters or adding hirelings and support NPCs to the party to shore up roles that the PCs don’t fill. When adding GM-controlled NPCs to the party, it’s important to be sure that the PCs remain the stars of the show. In general, GM-controlled characters shouldn’t make major decisions, and they shouldn’t outshine PCs at their primary skills or roles. You can also use variant rules like free archetypes (page 84), extra treasure, or even just a few bonus trained skills to help improve the PCs’ overall flexibility. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.169,r=0.472,b=0.451), with ID 0dd0361b-188b-485d-bb73-98e79580cdc8 -->

Large Groups
Large-group games bring together the creativity and enthusiasm of many players, and they lend themselves to combat at a grand scale. However, they also divide the GM’s attention. Large groups also need to set ground rules for how many players need to be present for the game to run when some players are missing. Recaps at the beginning of each session are crucial to keep everyone on the same page. Delegation is one of your most powerful tools to keep the session running smoothly. For example, you can put the players in charge of recapping the events from the previous session, handling initiative, managing the party’s treasury, looking up rules, or helping with accessories like props and music. Also consider which tasks really need to be taken care of while everyone is there. For example, you could ask your players to handle selling items, deciding which common items they want to buy, and leveling up between sessions instead of at the table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.461,r=0.471,b=0.754), with ID 2e9a6896-9ee2-4904-8b97-b4f726da23db -->

Inevitably, there will be situations and circumstances
that don’t involve the whole group. In a sufficiently large
group, splitting the party is not necessarily dangerous. If
the party splits up for more than a short stint, you can
call for separate sessions to determine what happens to
the two halves of the group, allowing them to reunite
and share their findings afterward. Whether or not the
party splits, having more players means less active time
for each character. Look for opportunities to highlight
each PC by providing challenges that play to their
strengths or tie in story elements to which they are
particularly connected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.755,r=0.471,b=0.939), with ID 89f2fa27-87be-41fb-8267-5263713955b7 -->

Player Needs  
Sometimes, making your game accessible and fun for everyone at the table requires making some adjustments to your typical GMing style or player setup. The first step is open communication so you can learn what the players need, what accommodations would be helpful, and what type of assistance players do and don’t want to receive. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.076,r=0.862,b=0.204), with ID 64e8c903-8b3f-40ac-9793-f303fba8e49b -->

Sensory Differences  
Players may have differences in the way that they process sensory information, as well as which senses they use. For players who are hard of hearing or who struggle to process large amounts of sensory information at once, selecting a quiet gaming venue and establishing ground rules about table talk (such as asking players not to interrupt each other) can make the game more accessible. Such players can also often benefit from handouts they can consult during the session. Keep in mind the way your players perceive the world when describing locations. For example, if you have a blind or visually impaired player at the table, instead of simply describing what a location looks like, describe how it sounds and smells, the temperature of the room, the feeling of the breeze, and other aspects of the scene that they can identify with. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.216,r=0.862,b=0.480), with ID 349fd3b7-24ac-4780-9f4c-bff156e3ee09 -->

Attention Span  
It’s not uncommon for people to struggle to maintain their attention for hours on end, especially for young players. If keeping attention is an issue at your table, add breaks to the game. Whether you’re just taking a break to stretch and chat or enjoying a full meal in the middle of the game, switching up the context helps players refresh their focus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.492,r=0.861,b=0.616), with ID d6165666-22f0-4a80-bb1a-2cbea35552a2 -->

Some players remain more engaged if they have
something else to do while playing, such as doodling
or pacing. Maintaining attention can be particularly
challenging for some players when their character is not
engaged, such as when the party splits or when they have
just finished their turn in a large combat. You can allow
players to engage in other activities during the session,
such as texting, reading, or playing other games, and
then draw them back into the game when their character
is active. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.618,r=0.860,b=0.770), with ID 8f4be6f3-fc88-4b17-bb36-d7159c3efe90 -->

CHARACTERS WITH DISABILITIES  
A player might want to create a character with a disability, or their character might end up with a disability over the course of play. Work with the player to find ways to respectfully represent the disability. Conditions such as blinded and deafened aren’t a good fit for a character who has been living with a disability long-term. Here are suggestions for rules you might use for PCs with disabilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.782,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID af3a9966-d67f-4190-a569-00836599d67f -->

MENTAL ILLNESS AND CHRONIC ILLNESS  
Some disabilities, such as mental illness and chronic illnesses, are best left to the player to roleplay. Mental illness is an especially fraught topic, with a history of insensitive portrayal. Be careful about the intentions of the player and the impact the presentation might have on other players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.072,r=0.515,b=0.220), with ID 38b00e20-98dc-47a0-8733-aa2fe5349d13 -->

Blindness or Impaired Vision  
A blind character can’t detect anything using vision, critically fails Perception checks requiring sight, is immune to visual effects, and can’t be blinded or dazzled. You might give this character the Blind-Fight feat (*Player Core* 145) for free. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.229,r=0.515,b=0.326), with ID 9689736f-1343-476a-b6d2-d056796adf2d -->

A character with impaired vision might take a
–2 to –4 penalty to vision-based Perception checks.
Spectacles or other corrective devices might reduce
or remove this, which can typically be found in most
major settlements. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.326,r=0.514,b=0.403), with ID ef4979de-2463-44c7-a8aa-0fea716008f9 -->

Deafness or Being Hard of Hearing  
A deaf character can’t detect anything using hearing, critically fails Perception checks that require hearing, and is immune to auditory effects. These disabilities typically don’t restrict their ability cast spells or use magic items, but if they perform an action they’re not accustomed to that involves auditory elements, they must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost. It’s best to give them the Sign Language feat for free, and you might give them Read Lips as well (Player Core 261). You might give one or more other characters in the group Sign Language for free as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.414,r=0.515,b=0.601), with ID a90205b8-d75e-4151-ad44-21827e356eac -->

A hard-of-hearing character might take a
–2 to –4 penalty to Perception checks that are
hearing-based. Like spectacles, corrective devices
for hearing can be found in most places that
adventurers find themselves trading. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.603,r=0.478,b=0.680), with ID f4778b0e-f75b-4856-8fd0-d01e0f564c07 -->

Missing Limbs and Mobility  
Some magic items require certain limbs or other body parts. It’s fine to allow an alternative form of the item, turning boots into bracers for a character without legs, for example. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.689,r=0.498,b=0.770), with ID c9065703-49cb-4e1b-850c-66f533ed337d -->

A character with a missing hand or arm might need
to spend 2 actions to Interact with an item that requires
two hands, or otherwise compensate. Using a two-handed
weapon is not possible. Someone missing a foot or leg
might take a small penalty to Speed, and if they have no
legs or are unable to walk, they might use a wheelchair,
a trained mount, or flight magic. Characters can typically
acquire prosthetics in most cities or settlements, which,
through advanced crafting, magic, or clockwork, can
provide various levels of assistive function. Many assistive
devices appear on page 293 of Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.771,r=0.512,b=0.940), with ID ed675746-9e3a-4a44-b431-171977d0c7ba -->

RARITY  
The rarity system is a powerful tool that helps you and your group customize your story, your characters, and your world to better match your game's themes and setting. You can also use it to keep the complexity of your game low by limiting access to unusual options. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.076,r=0.904,b=0.175), with ID aede8212-1ef7-475d-9a54-619f63e9feb5 -->

- **Common** elements are prevalent enough, at least among adventurers, that a player is assumed to be able to access them provided they meet the prerequisites (if any).
- **Uncommon** elements are difficult to access or regionally specific, but a PC can usually find them eventually with enough effort, potentially by choosing a specific character option or spending substantial downtime tracking them down.
- **Rare** elements are lost secrets, ancient magic, and other options that PCs can access only if you specifically make them available.
  - **Unique** elements are one of a kind, like a specific magical artifact or a named creature. You have full control over whether PCs can access them. Named NPCs are unique creatures, though that doesn’t mean their base creature type is unique. For instance, an orc named Graytusk is unique, but that doesn’t mean it would be any harder for a PC encountering her to tell she’s an orc—just to discern specific information about her. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.184,r=0.907,b=0.587), with ID 5ea6de38-9372-4e29-a11e-b180730b2071 -->

## Rarity and Power
Options of higher rarities aren’t necessarily more powerful than common ones, but they might have unusual capabilities with large ramifications for the campaign setting or the types of narrative moments common in a heroic fantasy game. For instance, the *raise dead* spell is uncommon, since Pathfinder’s default setting assumes that the death of important characters, like the leaders of nations or powerful villains, shouldn’t be easily reversed by any common priest or spellcaster, only those who have specialized knowledge in these secret arts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.557,t=0.597,r=0.906,b=0.787), with ID 82b624b9-4c5a-4e0c-ac6d-af0653f7b463 -->

**Different Contexts**
Just because something is common or uncommon in one context doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the same in others. This is specifically true when comparing the commonality of a creature and an ancestry. For instance, while hobgoblins are a relatively common monster for adventurers to encounter and are a common creature, in most settings they’re still far less prevalent than humans or elves and would be an uncommon ancestry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.797,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID 91c74207-dc14-4d84-aca5-d114a1b8c491 -->

22 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.958,r=0.084,b=0.983), with ID 9714d95d-7ae8-4f25-8230-8dd57375a0c6 -->

Running the Game <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.660,t=0.018,r=0.868,b=0.044), with ID 97eb25cc-00ca-4685-a359-db61fa2ae4e5 -->

Because uncommon elements are available in certain
circumstances, they often vary by locale, even within
the same setting. For instance, a katana is uncommon
in the Inner Sea region of Golarion, but in the Asian
fantasy-inspired Tian Xia, a katana would be common
and some Inner Sea weapons might be uncommon.
Similarly, in an elven kingdom, uncommon elven
weapons like the elven curve blade might be common. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.079,r=0.470,b=0.206), with ID f3453211-dbe7-482a-8398-2480f63d67f5 -->

Access Entries  
Uncommon elements sometimes have an Access entry in their stat block. An Access entry usually speaks to elements of a character’s backstory or experiences, such as “follower of Shelyn,” “member of the Pathfinder Society,” or “from Absalom.” A character who meets the access requirements can freely choose that option just like they would a common option, even though it’s uncommon. Unlike a Prerequisites entry, an Access entry never speaks to mechanical requirements needed to make the rules function, so if you’d like to modify Access requirements, you can do so without worrying about altering game balance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.216,r=0.471,b=0.419), with ID 3822b429-0d12-4651-af87-d00cf812c44c -->

Starting Elements  
Elements like ancestries, backgrounds, classes, and heritages that a player must select at character creation can still be uncommon or rare. Obviously, there’s no opportunity for the player character to search for them during play, but these rarities still indicate the prevalence of adventurers with those elements in the world. You can decide to allow them on a case-by-case basis depending on the campaign and the story your group wants to tell. For instance, a game set in the lizardfolk empire of Droon might have lizardfolk (normally uncommon) as a common ancestry while the typical common ancestries are less common. An official player’s guide for a Pathfinder Adventure Path might have uncommon backgrounds that you can access by playing the Adventure Path. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.428,r=0.472,b=0.680), with ID 6412c99d-fe32-4efd-b5b1-a8961bad2b73 -->

Storytelling  
You might craft a quest involving an uncommon or rare subject. For instance, players might encounter a door that requires a rare spell to open and have to travel to an academy to learn it. If a player has their heart set on an option that’s not common, look for ways to build a story in which their character acquires that option. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.689,r=0.471,b=0.802), with ID 9f4ffac4-c35a-425e-945c-b288750509ca -->

## World Building
With the rarities at your fingertips, you and your group can start building a unique world using rarity as a tool. Imagine a world where one or more of the core classes are rare. Maybe the gods rarely answer the call of the faithful and a PC cleric is one of the only clerics in the world. Perhaps sorcerers are rare and feared by wizards’ guilds, which have a stranglehold on spell <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.812,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID bc644295-3965-4269-a12b-d279f69f87d6 -->

access. For a grittier feel, you could make abilities that
can remove afflictions uncommon or rare. You could
even create a low-magic setting where all magic and
magic items are uncommon or rare. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.081,r=0.859,b=0.142), with ID 535b0f00-9222-4a2e-a812-c1c89453b43e -->

You can add, remove, or alter Access entries to fit
your world. For instance, if in your world the goddess
of death guards the secrets of resurrection, you might
add an Access entry to *raise dead* and *resurrection* for
characters who worship that goddess. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.143,r=0.859,b=0.218), with ID 22ef70f9-dc3e-482f-9e97-db2abedd43c1 -->

These are just a few ideas to help get you started. The
number of ways you can vary rarities to adjust your
setting, story, and game are nearly unlimited. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.219,r=0.860,b=0.265), with ID 3fbcb8d2-64f0-4b4d-b8a1-ccc3aa93fbce -->

# RUNNING ENCOUNTERS

_Encounters are the major set pieces of a story, where characters come into direct engagement with each other. They can take many forms: a brawl in a tavern, a race to disarm a doomsday device before it detonates, or even an impassioned negotiation with the queen. Whenever stakes are high and a character’s moment-to-moment actions could make or break the scene, you’ll want to call for initiative and dive into encounter mode._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.077,r=0.908,b=0.200), with ID b62e9615-f5e2-48c1-ac38-08b4c4d02afc -->

**Stakes:** Moderate to high. Encounters always have significant stakes, and they’re played in a step-by-step time frame to reflect that. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.233,r=0.514,b=0.279), with ID 18591355-6562-41fd-9358-7834af71f95b -->

**Time Scale:** Encounter mode is highly structured and proceeds in discrete rounds, with each character taking their turn to act in a set order. In combat encounters, each round is 6 seconds long (so a minute-long duel would take 10 rounds). In social encounters, you might <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.280,r=0.515,b=0.356), with ID c73217ac-0808-40b8-a82d-684c836256c0 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy character illustration depicting a heavily armored adventurer equipped for battle, shown in a dynamic pose with a variety of weapons and gear.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a male fantasy warrior or adventurer, standing in a ready stance.
  • He wears ornate, gold and bronze plate armor with blue and brown fabric accents.
  • The character is holding a large, sheathed sword in both hands, with the hilt and scabbard visible.
  • A quiver of arrows and a bow are slung over his back, indicating proficiency with ranged weapons.
  • The color palette is dominated by metallic gold, bronze, brown, and blue, with some green and red accents.
  • The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, highlighting the details of the armor and equipment.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible textures on armor, fabric, and leather.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character occupies the center of the composition, facing slightly to the left.
  • The bow and quiver are positioned over the left shoulder, while the sword is held diagonally across the body.
  • Armor pieces cover the shoulders, chest, arms, and legs, with layered plates and straps.
  • Pouches and a drinking horn are attached to the belt, suggesting preparedness for travel or combat.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of readiness and capability, with the character equipped for both melee and ranged combat.
  • The detailed armor and gear suggest a high-status or experienced adventurer, possibly a ranger or fighter archetype.
  • The dynamic pose and rich detailing emphasize the character’s preparedness and versatility in a fantasy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.368,r=0.529,b=0.964), with ID 3d4d0cb6-1da6-470e-9a6f-61ac7e729f3a -->

**Actions and Reactions:** In combat encounters, each participant’s turn is broken into discrete actions, and participants can use reactions when their triggers occur. Reactions can occur in social situations, though their triggers are usually more descriptive and less tactical. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.266,r=0.904,b=0.342), with ID 31232cd6-a477-4b1f-9e9b-ce79e6b704f4 -->

Starting the Encounter
Encounters typically begin when you ask your players to roll initiative, which sets the order that the characters will act in. The full rules for rolling initiative can be found on page 435 of Player Core, but in brief, initiative involves each character rolling a check—usually a Perception check, but possibly a different skill if you deem it appropriate—and then acting in order from highest result to lowest. Below, you’ll find specifics on how to run certain types of initiative or deal with problems. These are guidelines, and you might prefer to execute initiative in a different way at your table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.353,r=0.905,b=0.540), with ID d0f9d688-7d43-48a7-8d1d-d8f7e4951a94 -->

When do you ask players to roll initiative? In most
cases, it’s pretty simple: you call for the roll as soon as
one participant intends to attack (or issue a challenge,
draw a weapon, cast a preparatory spell, start a social
encounter such as a debate, or otherwise begin to use an
action that their foes can’t help but notice). A player will
tell you if their character intends to start a conflict, and
you’ll determine when the actions of NPCs and other
creatures initiate combat. Occasionally, two sides might
stumble across one another. In this case, there isn’t much
time to decide, but you should still ask if anyone intends
to attack. If the PCs and NPCs alike just want to talk or
negotiate, there’s no reason to roll initiative only to drop
out of combat immediately! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.542,r=0.905,b=0.754), with ID 68d0f8b6-cafb-4959-8a97-68a259771642 -->

Alternative Initiative Skills
Most times, characters will use Perception to roll initiative; however, there are a number of times that another skill might make sense. Occasionally calling for different skills in the initiative check can be a good way to create variety in encounters. Consider the following factors when deciding which checks to allow. 

You’ll likely call for Stealth for a character who’s Avoiding Notice or hiding before combat.
You might call for Deception if a character decides to initiate a surprise attack during a negotiation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.767,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID 6e1dd4a2-309f-440f-ab3d-9155576cc94e -->

RUNNING THE GAME <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.018,r=0.868,b=0.043), with ID 50d048a1-897d-41e9-b5d9-1b9563b7cda0 -->

- • You might call for Society for a character who realizes that the diplomat they’re talking to is actually a spy based on misinformation in their cover story.
- • You might call for a magical skill like Arcana or Occultism for a spellcaster studying a strange magical phenomenon that suddenly summons a monster to fight the party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.205), with ID eb83e6ea-3f2c-4f5e-a59e-26e8b93f7db0 -->

You can allow a player to make a case that they should
use a different skill than Perception, but only if they base
it on something they’ve established beforehand. For
example, if in the prelude to the attack, Merisiel’s player
had said, “I’m going to dangle down off the chandelier to
get the drop on them,” you could let them use Acrobatics
for their initiative roll. If they just said, “Hey, I want
to attack these guys. Can I use Acrobatics?” without
having established a reason beforehand, you probably
shouldn’t allow it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.217,r=0.472,b=0.371), with ID f3c6d427-218f-4ec4-935c-b0bd257e5152 -->

You might find that if a player has a low Perception
but a high modifier in another skill, that player might
keep trying to use it for future encounters. As long as
the narrative plays out in a reasonable manner, it’s fine
to allow the skill. However, if you find that they start
making up odd circumstances to use their pet skill, or
that their justifications for using the skill take too long
at the table, just tell them you’d like them to go back to
using Perception for a while. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.372,r=0.471,b=0.510), with ID 89d86b49-b99a-49c6-95c5-395e0f4d8f6a -->

Initiative with Hidden Enemies  
When members on one or both sides of an impending battle are being stealthy, you’ll need to deal with the impacts of Stealth on the start of the encounter. Anyone who’s Avoiding Notice should attempt a Stealth check for their initiative. All the normal bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having cover. You can give them the option to roll Perception instead, but if they do, they forsake their Stealth and are definitely going to be detected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.519,r=0.471,b=0.678), with ID e893f7e5-37af-4021-b324-282778aecb35 -->

To determine whether someone is undetected by
other participants in the encounter, you still compare
their Stealth check for initiative to the Perception
DC of their enemies. They're undetected by anyone
whose DC they meet or exceed. So what do you do if
someone rolls better than everyone else on initiative,
but all their foes beat their Perception DC? Well, all the
enemies are undetected, but not unnoticed. That means
the participant who rolled high still knows someone
is around and can start moving about, Seeking, and
otherwise preparing to fight. The characters Avoiding
Notice still have a significant advantage since the other
characters need to spend actions and attempt additional
checks in order to find them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.679,r=0.471,b=0.892), with ID bdeca4c9-61a7-4ec8-9a27-b2efa52dff25 -->

What if both sides are sneaking about? They might just sneak past each other entirely, or they might suddenly run into one another if they’re heading into the same location. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.893,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 309d1dba-856e-4fdc-ac65-d8ca4c87f07c -->

## GM PRIORITIES
As the Game Master, you’ll want to keep the following points in mind to create a fun experience for all the players—yourself included—when you run encounters.
- • Answering questions quickly and decisively whenever possible
- • Building anticipation for what happens next
- • Emphasizing thrilling action and setting a rapid pace
- • Letting players know when they’re up, and preferably also when they’re “on deck” to go next
- • Showing the immediate consequences of actions <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.074,r=0.861,b=0.278), with ID e6e9ba52-7f59-4687-bcf0-be4505794133 -->

Batch Initiative  
If you have multiple enemies of the same type, such as four goblin warriors, you might want to have them act on the same initiative for simplicity. If you do, you can roll just one initiative check for all of them. They still take individual turns and can still individually change their initiative by Delaying. Note that a lucky initiative check could mean the batched creatures can easily gang up on the PCs, and a terrible roll could mean they all get struck down before they can do anything, so use this technique only when necessary to keep the game moving. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.290,r=0.862,b=0.466), with ID 71aa7bb1-68ad-4bef-a1fb-e243c5eb7f96 -->

Placing Characters on the Map
If the PCs are already moving on a grid, as often happens in small dungeons, you already know where they are when they roll initiative. If they’re moving in free-form exploration, place them on the map when they roll initiative. The fastest way is to have the players set up their miniatures or tokens in a basic marching order ahead of time, then just move them onto the map in that formation. When that doesn’t work, such as when one or more PCs were in a different location or the map doesn’t fit the marching order, you can either set up the PC minis yourself, then ask if everybody is happy with where they are, or have the players place their own minis. If you find having the players do it themselves causes too much indecision (especially if they try to count out distances in advance), you can switch methods. Remember to place characters using Stealth in reasonable hiding spots, even if that means you have to adjust the marching order to do so. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.475,r=0.862,b=0.755), with ID 41a727c1-ab1d-4af2-974d-0f25ed042d96 -->

Setting the Scene  
When an encounter begins, spend a moment to describe the location if you haven’t already, using some of the description tips found in Evocative Environments on page 38. It can help to describe where enemies are within the environment to better ground them in the location. You can also use the enemies’ expressions to better convey the location. Is an enemy in a wary stance as they stand near a pit? Is another irritated by water dripping on it from the ceiling? Does a glowing glyph illuminate an enemy with a sinister red light? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.767,r=0.861,b=0.939), with ID 7d1955e3-2a71-4e2d-a0d2-d42739bb505d -->

## UNEXPECTED DIFFICULTY
What do you do when an encounter ends up being far more or less challenging than you anticipated? If the encounter is unlikely to kill all the characters, it might be best to roll with it, unless the fight is so frustrating that no one really wants to continue. If it’s likely to kill everyone, strongly consider ways to end the encounter differently. The villain might offer the PCs the chance to surrender, consider their task complete and leave, or use their advantage to get something else they want. If the worst does happen, suggestions for dealing with a total party kill can be found on page 30. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.145,t=0.080,r=0.502,b=0.278), with ID be6395ba-1fcb-47b1-ae78-8ce780cb0f9d -->

If a battle is too easy, it's often best to let the players enjoy their victory. However, if you intended this to be a centerpiece battle, that might feel anticlimactic. Look for ways the enemy might escape or bring in reinforcements, but the PCs' success should still matter. Make sure the PCs feel the enemy's desperation—possibly have the enemy sacrifice something important to them to secure their escape. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.148,t=0.279,r=0.503,b=0.402), with ID 0e3e6c16-0c4a-49af-921e-4083b2050213 -->

In both these cases, consider whether the discrepancy from your expectations is due to luck. One side benefiting from extreme luck is to be expected from time to time. However, if the challenge comes down to a factor you had control over as a GM—like unfavorable terrain making things hard for the PCs or a monster with an overpowered ability—it's more likely you should make adjustments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.151,t=0.403,r=0.504,b=0.512), with ID 4a13d43a-7fc4-4d88-a585-9c83dc5ac09a -->

## RUNNING THE ENCOUNTER
Once you’ve rolled initiative and set the scene, it’s time to
dive into the encounter. Go around the table in initiative
order, asking each player what they would like to do on
their turn; when it comes time for any NPCs, monsters, or
features of the environment to act, you play them yourself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.536,r=0.513,b=0.633), with ID 4e95e7ba-3f40-4eba-b5f8-c117365fbf02 -->

### Choosing Adversaries’ Actions
Players often coordinate and plan to be as efficient as possible, but their adversaries might not. As the GM, you’re roleplaying these foes, and you decide their tactics. Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like flanking or focusing on a single target. You should remember that they also react based on emotions and make mistakes—perhaps even more than the player characters do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.643,r=0.513,b=0.785), with ID 48300e50-fc9c-4e33-8ec0-05dae8cbb46f -->

When selecting targets or choosing which abilities to use, rely on the adversaries’ knowledge of the situation, not your own. You might know that the cleric has a high Will save modifier, but a monster might still try to use a fear ability on them. That doesn’t mean you should play adversaries as complete fools; they can learn from their mistakes, make sound plans, and even research the player characters in advance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.787,r=0.513,b=0.907), with ID 980ba8dc-0853-468c-b95f-548600571a45 -->

Adversaries usually don’t attack a character who’s
knocked out. Even if a creature knows a fallen character <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.908,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 2ff462b2-a49a-48ae-b1db-7cd77f11c8e7 -->

might come back into the fight, only the most vicious  
creatures focus on helpless foes rather than the more  
immediate threats around them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.126), with ID 75da75a8-722c-4e5b-88f7-e5b361fe4b56 -->

Running adversaries is a mix of being true to the
creature and doing what’s best for the drama of the
game. Think of your encounter like a fight scene in a
movie or novel. If the fighter taunts a fire giant to draw
its attention away from the fragile wizard, the tactically
sound decision is for the giant to keep pummeling the
wizard, but is that the best choice for the scene? Perhaps
everyone will have more fun if the giant redirects its ire
to the infuriating fighter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.127,r=0.904,b=0.264), with ID 80eea370-3f5c-4deb-8722-cc704a7127fb -->

Speed of Play  
Encounters should move quickly, giving the PCs just enough time to savor successes and lament failures. This requires effort from everyone, but you can make it easier by running creatures and NPCs efficiently. First off, don’t worry too much about little mistakes you make when running encounters. If you forgot to apply a creature’s special bonus or didn’t take an action that would’ve prevented the creature from taking damage, it isn’t a big deal. Keep an eye on what you emphasize during the adventure as well. Be quick when describing a normal attack, but spend a little more time on a critical hit or a big spell. This all boils down to significance. It’s fine to slow down the game for something important, but it’s best to move briskly through anything less so. As you run the game, you’ll quickly develop a sense for what’s significant and what’s not. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.276,r=0.904,b=0.540), with ID 7e6603dc-14e9-48d4-aa46-8e7cd387719b -->

Looking up Rules  
One of the primary ways the game slows down is when you or another player needs to look up a rule. For something that isn’t too impactful, it’s better to just make a ruling on the spot and move on. Tell the player they can look it up when it isn’t their turn, and you’ll play it as written after that, but that the game needs to move on in the meantime. It’s okay to look up something that’s both significant and heavily rules-dependent, such as a spell description or the death and dying rules. Even then, reciting a full chunk of rules text can pull players out of the flow of play, so feel free to summarize. It also helps to train your players to look things up in advance if they think they’ll need them, so they’re ready to go when their turns come around. This can be tough as a GM since it’s essentially always your turn. However, you can ask a player to look something up for you, or, if you need to pause long enough to reference certain books, remind the players to plan for their next turns while you’re busy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.553,r=0.904,b=0.846), with ID e4cc5d86-13d9-4f23-9f07-c71976c1656f -->

Rewinding  
Though “rewinding” can happen in any mode of play, it’s usually most troublesome in encounters. Rewinding happens when a player forgot to add in a certain bonus or take a certain action, or wishes they’d used their actions <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.860,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 5e21fad5-7f97-4770-9cc2-63b4b62c5b68 -->

Running the Game <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.019,r=0.867,b=0.044), with ID 2a011d46-978e-4996-954b-bba1d9ba4506 -->

in a different order, and wants to rewind to account for
what they missed. The best policy is usually to let them
rewind as needed within their own turn but stop them
before they intrude into someone else’s. This keeps
interruptions within reasonable bounds. You might find
some adjustments are easy enough to make outside of a
turn and can be allowed. For instance, if someone forgot
to add the extra damage from a runic weapon spell to one
of their hits, it’s pretty easy to reduce the monster’s HP
on another turn, but if they realized their attack missed
only because they forgot the bonus from bless, that could
be too much of an interruption. Your ruling should stand
on such matters. Try to be consistent about what kinds of
things you’ll rewind for and when. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.297), with ID 356ed68e-7ad2-472d-8129-e571886c7727 -->

Complex Rolls  
You’ll often make multiple rolls at the same time, especially when attempting saving throws for multiple creatures against area or multi-target spells. This can sometimes take a considerable amount of time if you’re resolving the result of each creature’s save and then determining its degree of success. To do so quickly, you could use one of the following techniques. Each of the examples below uses a PC’s spell as an example, but these recommendations also apply to similar rolls that aren’t caused by spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.306,r=0.471,b=0.478), with ID e9c3fa81-0754-4668-9ae4-e29c990c2f2e -->

- • Get the PC’s Difficulty Class first, and have the player roll damage while you roll the saving throws.
- • Use separate colors of dice for the different types of foes, or arrange the dice in such a way that it’s easier for you to tell which creatures or NPCs are which.
- • Go in order from the best enemy results (the highest total) to the worst. This means you’ll need to ask for the results on a success only once, the damage on a failure once, and so on. It also means you only need to figure out when you’re moving to a lower degree of success, rather than recalculating them each time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.479,r=0.471,b=0.665), with ID bafd2d56-2ab2-4a13-aa4c-d85eda33b3d2 -->

This can be more of a challenge when asking for PC rolls. Make sure you get the attention of every player whose PC is affected. Have them all roll, but hold off on announcing their results. While they roll their saves, roll damage or other variable effects. Then, announce the DC. Say, “Who critically succeeded?” and “Who succeeded?” and so on down the line, so you only have to share the results for each category once. You can choose not to announce the DC if you want and ask for results by multiples of 10 instead, but it typically takes longer, and it’s still possible that the players can determine or estimate the DC anyway. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.677,r=0.471,b=0.863), with ID ac7ac9a8-a8c2-4a29-8d4a-4ef4dcdc8fc8 -->

Adjudicating Actions  
Some of the basic actions of the game require you to  
interpret how a rule should apply. Here, you’ll find advice  
on the types of rules calls that can occur frequently. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.873,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID d406edb4-3cd8-465d-8b99-5aa832fd2e84 -->

For rules decisions that are either/or (such as whether a creature can Aid or Take Cover), a PC can usually determine before they take the action whether doing so is viable; if it isn’t viable for some reason, alert them that it won’t work before they spend time, actions, or resources trying. There are some exceptions, especially if the reason an action wouldn’t work is something a character wouldn’t know. For example, if a character tries to Take Cover behind a wall, not realizing it’s illusory, you shouldn’t reveal the deception prematurely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.080,r=0.861,b=0.235), with ID 29e59cac-5889-4782-bdff-8d4a7c34ee4b -->

Aid
It’s up to you whether someone’s preparation is enough to let them Aid an ally. The preparation should be specific to the task at hand. Helping someone hold a lockpick steady might be enough preparation to Aid an attempt to Pick a Lock, but just saying you’re going to “encourage” them likely wouldn’t. Second, the character who’s attempting to Aid needs to be in a proper position to help and able to convey any necessary information. Helping a character Climb a wall is pretty tough if the character a PC wishes to Aid is nowhere near them. Similarly, a character usually needs to be next to their ally or a foe to Aid the ally in attacking the foe. You’ll also need to determine how long the preparation takes. Typically, a single action is sufficient to help with a task that’s completed in a single round, but to help someone perform a long-term task, like research, the character has to help until the task is finished. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.245,r=0.861,b=0.510), with ID cb388cce-73be-4378-ac67-a0c515d87873 -->

Ready
The Ready activity lets the acting person choose the
trigger for their readied action. However, you might
sometimes need to put limits on what they can choose.
Notably, the trigger must be something that happens in
the game world and is observable by the character, rather
than a rules concept that doesn’t exist in-world. For
instance, if a player says, “I Ready to shoot an arrow at
her if she uses a concentrate action” or “I Ready to attack
him if he has fewer than forty-seven Hit Points,” find
out what their character is trying to specifically observe.
If they don’t have a clear answer for that, they need to
adjust their action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.522,r=0.862,b=0.724), with ID 8a98ec28-dc86-47ca-88ba-f7bf06ae4cfc -->

Seek  
The Seek action leaves it up to you how long a search should take. Use common sense. Most of the time, just trying to spot a creature hiding in a small area, or something else you could find with a simple Seek action rather than a long-term Search exploration activity, should default to a single action. The biggest distinction is whether something uses 3 actions or fewer—and can therefore be accomplished in a single turn—or requires significantly longer and can’t be accomplished in an encounter at all. Consider whether it makes sense for the character to pull this off during the encounter or not, and whether that could be an interesting wrinkle in the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.737,r=0.860,b=0.940), with ID 1e6faada-c109-4eee-ba36-c33e2ef6dfe4 -->

Sense Motive  
When someone tries to Sense the Motive of an NPC, you’ll need to figure out how to convey the information they receive. It’s best to try to convey this indirectly, such as by describing a lying target’s body language, odd word choices, sweating, or other details rather than saying, “They aren’t behaving normally.” However, sometimes dropping a punchy, “Oh, she is a hundred percent lying about this!” on a critical success can be satisfying. You also might need to determine when the situation changes enough for someone to try to Sense Motive again. Usually, this means either the behavior of the subject needs to change or the person attempting the check needs to receive new evidence that something is out of the ordinary. If another PC tries to Sense Motive, gets different information about the target, and shares it, that doesn’t really count as new information for a PC who tried previously. Rather, it’s up to the players to roleplay out any changes in their thinking as a result. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.076,r=0.516,b=0.375), with ID 828897c9-dbf7-47be-9305-0683741caaae -->

Take Cover  
You’ll often need to determine whether someone can Take Cover. They usually just need a large enough object to hide behind. Imagine the character crouching, and picture whether the object could almost entirely cover up their silhouette. Taking Cover might also require them to Drop Prone, such as if they want to take cover under a table. Most of the time, you can let them combine these instead of using two separate actions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.383,r=0.514,b=0.527), with ID e387f08f-9b9b-48be-b43a-63a78ede8283 -->

Ad Hoc Bonuses and Penalties  
This section covers a few ground rules for how to best respond to PC tactics, when to apply ad hoc bonuses and penalties, and when to use certain tactics for NPCs. When PCs put effort into getting advantages against their foes, there should be some payoff, provided their tactics make sense in the narrative. Ad hoc bonuses and penalties give you some mechanical tools to emphasize that. Also keep in mind that you can change the flow of the story to respond to tactics as well. Altering an enemy’s behavior can be a more satisfying consequence than just getting a bonus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.536,r=0.514,b=0.723), with ID ccb0f970-7e52-4567-9206-60592eb658ed -->

- • Is this the result of an interesting, surprising, or novel strategy by the character?
- • Did this take effort or smart thinking to set up?
- • Is this easy to replicate in pretty much every battle? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.725,r=0.513,b=0.848), with ID c9b04a6f-7129-4298-91e7-449c0d9bf6de -->

If you answered yes to either of the first two, it’s more
likely you should assign a bonus—typically a +1 or +2
circumstance bonus. However, if you answered yes to
the third, you probably shouldn’t unless you really do
want to see that tactic used over and over again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.862,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID dda032b8-6501-47e4-82cf-22067631b2f0 -->

- • Does the environment or terrain create any applicable disadvantages for the character?
- • Should the character have expected that this would be more difficult based on what they already knew?
- • Was this circumstance caused by a bad decision on the part of the one taking the penalty?
- • Is this negative circumstance easy to replicate in pretty much every battle? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.079,r=0.907,b=0.250), with ID f841a482-d8cd-4412-94fe-3ff39d56555a -->

Once again, answering yes to most of these questions
means it’s more likely you should apply a penalty, and
answering yes to the final question means it less likely
you should do so. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.265,r=0.905,b=0.326), with ID ef4a7e88-7e05-49a8-93c7-460d36e2c276 -->

## Maps and Miniatures
A grid and miniatures can make it easier to visualize
combat for players and give a visual centerpiece for the
players to focus on. A setup can range from a basic grid
with some hasty marker lines and coins for miniatures
to a full-color Flip-Mat with official pre-painted minis
or cardboard pawns, all the way to a set of 3D dungeon
terrain and hand-painted minis for each character. Many
virtual tabletops have preset maps, token packs, and
built-in functions for movement and line of sight. All of
these resources can be fun to play on! Your setup should
match your time commitment, budget, and the aesthetics
you want. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.337,r=0.904,b=0.539), with ID c7cec5f8-d812-4a71-a376-cd0f2d05413f -->

You can also bring the setting alive by describing

Placing miniatures on a grid can make it feel like you need to be exacting with the rules, but there’s still room for improvisation! You might give another 5 feet of movement to someone running downhill if it will make their turn more dramatic. You’re empowered to give players minor boosts that fit the story you want to tell and to fill in nuances of the location beyond what appears on the map. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.633,r=0.903,b=0.755), with ID 4017f46a-c21c-4abd-953c-55905144a8b8 -->

Cover  
You determine whether a character has cover. The rules for drawing lines found in Player Core are useful in simple cases, but in more complicated situations, use your own discretion to make the call. Consider the details of the environment and 3D space beyond what’s on the battle mat. For instance, hanging banners might give cover, or a PC who climbed onto a ledge might have a clear shot at an enemy standing behind a short wall. Be generous to PCs who use creativity to get into smart positions, especially if they spend valuable actions to move or Take Cover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.768,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID d1133393-02e1-4891-b7db-94d516ffa35d -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing an intense confrontation between a dragon-like creature and two armored adventurers in a misty, swampy forest.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a large, menacing, green dragon with tattered wings, glowing red eyes, and a gaping mouth full of sharp teeth.
  • The dragon wields a large, dark, rune-etched mace in its right hand.
  • In the foreground, an armored figure in blue and gold, with a yellow scarf and a curved sword, faces the dragon, ready to engage.
  • In the background, a second, smaller armored figure with a horned helmet is perched on the dragon’s back, possibly attacking or attempting to control it.
  • The setting is a dense, misty forest with swampy water, fallen branches, and large mushrooms on the right edge.
  • The color palette is dominated by greens, browns, and muted golds, with dramatic lighting highlighting the dragon and the foreground adventurer.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • No visible text or UI elements.
  • The illustration uses dynamic, diagonal lines to convey action and tension.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The dragon occupies the central and left portions of the image, looming over the scene.
  • The foreground adventurer is positioned at the lower right, sword drawn, facing the dragon.
  • The second adventurer is in the upper center, riding or attacking the dragon from behind.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the dragon’s head and the foreground adventurer’s sword near key focal points.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a dramatic, high-stakes battle in a fantasy setting, emphasizing the size and ferocity of the dragon compared to the human figures.
  • The use of perspective and lighting draws attention to the confrontation and the imminent clash between the characters.
  • The presence of two adventurers suggests teamwork or a multi-pronged attack strategy against the formidable creature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID eca69a35-9cf5-4064-ba53-476f7114617c -->

Splitting and Combining Movement  
The different types of actions representing movement are split up to clarify how the rules work with a creature’s actions. However, you can end up in odd situations, such as when a creature wants to jump vertically to get something and needs to move just a bit to get in range, then Leap, then continue moving. This can end up feeling like they’re losing a lot of their movement to make this happen. At your discretion, you can allow the PCs to essentially combine these into one fluid movement as a 2-action activity: moving into range for a Leap, then Leaping, then using the rest of their Speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.535,r=0.472,b=0.724), with ID 2935c745-34bb-4251-8da9-be94d9842334 -->

This typically works only for chaining types of
movement together. Doing something like Interacting to
open a door or making a Strike usually arrests movement
long enough that doing so in the middle of movement
isn’t practical. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.724,r=0.471,b=0.801), with ID 08881280-4e0b-4427-922b-7e10f1ad5411 -->

Special Battles and Movement  
More complex battles can require specialized rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.812,r=0.441,b=0.848), with ID 64cf755d-bc23-4775-a817-daf4333ff43d -->

Mounted Combat  
The logistics of mounted combat take some extra work. If you know one is coming up, make sure the fight takes place in a location with plenty of space to move, since you’ll likely be dealing with multiple larger creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.859,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID b52adb52-f8bd-42d4-a4e0-631118756f89 -->

For a fight in which only one side has mounts, you might
want an environment with a few areas too small for
mounts, so the side on foot can get a tactical advantage
there to offset the other side’s greater mobility. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.541,r=0.861,b=0.602), with ID 2f946805-16c9-4e1a-a930-1db55e2a3f21 -->

When the PCs are mounted, their enemies should focus most of their attacks on the PCs, not their mounts. It can be frustrating for players if foes target PCs’ mounts too frequently, so have the enemies remember who the real threat is! When PCs fight mounted enemies, try to keep the mount’s level fairly close to the PCs’ level; rather than putting a 13th-level enemy on a 2nd-level war horse, use an 11th-level greater nightmare or something similar. This will fit better thematically and prevent the enemy from being dismounted too easily. If a mount is knocked out, the rider might be able to dismount without trouble if the mount was stationary, but if they were in motion, you should probably have the rider attempt a Reflex save. If they fail, the rider is thrown a short distance and falls prone. Setting a simple expert DC of 20 often works well for such checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.603,r=0.860,b=0.846), with ID 0d467583-14b6-4264-9bc0-3ecad52ae67b -->

Mounted combat on a grid is difficult for a running
fight with both sides racing at full speed. In these
situations, it can be better to forgo the grid, though
miniatures can still help for relative positioning and
distances for ranged attacks. For such a race, consider
using the chase subsystem instead (page 156). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.848,r=0.860,b=0.938), with ID 7e2396c3-4f06-4bfd-a037-302adb01698f -->

## GRID VARIANTS
These two variants can change up how distance and movement work in your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.092,r=0.503,b=0.144), with ID c3a110c6-572f-45e0-afcf-05ad50dbf723 -->

# Going Gridless
You can play encounters without a grid at all. This is best for groups who can easily imagine their surroundings without a visual aid and for battles that don’t require understanding a complex physical space. Your game doesn’t have to be entirely on or off maps—you might decide to play out most simple fights without a grid, then use one for highly tactical fights or major set pieces. The 3-action structure is your best friend. You might find yourself answering a lot of questions about actions and space, like “Can I get there this turn?” or “How many of the oozes can I catch in a fireball?” If you find yourself needing to repeatedly remind players of the physical features of the environment or enemy positioning, that might mean you’re making your encounters too tactical for what a gridless game supports. This style works better to encourage imaginative, cinematic action and quick play without getting too hung up on details. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.151,t=0.153,r=0.502,b=0.435), with ID ad63f80e-76fc-468e-8f51-91c07ae7d1e3 -->

## Uniform Diagonals
If you like, your group can count all diagonals as 5 feet instead of counting every other diagonal as 10 feet. This speeds up play, but some people find it breaks their suspension of disbelief. This is most noticeable when someone moves a long distance along a diagonal all at once or when characters start moving diagonally as much as possible to cover more distance. Using this variant requires thinking of the game map in more abstract terms, and less like a real physical environment where the map is accurately reflecting the size of the room or encounter area. You can choose whether you measure radius-based areas of spells in the same way or visualize them as circles or other round shapes. The latter works best if you have templates to use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.445,r=0.502,b=0.679), with ID 6184f20d-a3d3-4bc6-aa1e-a78a7c285eb4 -->

## Hex Grids
Some of the challenges of diagonal movement can be fixed by using a hex grid instead of a square grid, or by using a grid with offset squares, which works similarly. This allows you to count movement the same in all directions. However, it makes flanking a bit harder to pull off, requires you to arrange standard Large and larger miniatures differently, and causes challenges when drawing maps that consist primarily of rectangular structures since you'll have a lot of partially occupied hexes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.154,t=0.690,r=0.502,b=0.848), with ID cf4c02a4-1acd-401f-ace4-301c04301716 -->

The mount rules are for common cases: humanoids
riding quadrupedal animals. However, you might allow
someone to ride a beast or other type of creature by
making a few adjustments. For an intelligent mount <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.876,r=0.513,b=0.941), with ID 59e979f4-bd45-4ad4-87e7-c0101c06f680 -->

(such as a pegasus or unicorn), use the standard rules for mounted combat, but instead of attempting a check to Command an Animal, the rider uses the same number of actions to ask the creature to do what they want. As the GM, you determine whether the creature does as requested and whether Diplomacy checks or the like are needed. If one of your PCs is Tiny, they might want to ride on another PC’s shoulder. In this case, the two PCs should both roll initiative and act together on the lower count, and they gain only two actions at the start of their turns instead of three since the larger PC must spend one action keeping the smaller PC balanced, and the smaller PC must spend one action holding on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.079,r=0.906,b=0.281), with ID 7ebf4712-4812-4801-bfc2-b260ed455e9a -->

Aerial Combat  
Determining positioning in the air can be tricky, and it’s often best to be more relaxed with movement rules, flanking, and so forth than you would be on a flat grid. Note that battles can get more spread out with flight. If any creature is flying, it’s important to establish the height of potential obstacles in the area early. This way, no one is surprised to suddenly find out the ceiling is lower than they thought or tall trees create a barrier. Be careful about using aerial combat before PCs have magic that lets them fly. Be especially careful with flying foes who use ranged attacks because PCs might not have many good tools to fight them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.292,r=0.905,b=0.494), with ID 732d6331-83f6-49ee-a72d-7bb0c2abf7d6 -->

The rules for flight say that a creature might need to attempt an Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight to pull off tricky motions. You can generally use the same judgment you would while calling for Acrobatics checks when someone is moving on the ground. Trying to dive through a narrow space or make a sharp turn might require checks, usually with a simple DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.495,r=0.904,b=0.602), with ID 337c4c11-79f9-404c-9317-b65b32086d4d -->

Falls can be deadly and often happen when *fly* or a
similar spell gets dispelled. This is part of the risk of
flying! Flying enemies might keep closer to the ground to
avoid this danger, or use magic such as the *gentle landing*
spell to prevent the damage or a *jade cat talisman* to
reduce it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.602,r=0.904,b=0.693), with ID 632ccd34-d4c6-450f-98f8-01d4966f9264 -->

Aquatic Combat  
Pathfinder’s rules are fairly generous for high-action battles underwater. Two significant challenges for non-aquatic creatures are breathing underwater (or holding their breath) and lacking a swim Speed. It’s often best to save aquatic adventure until higher levels when PCs can get magical solutions for these problems, but you can instead give out such magic early since it isn’t easy to exploit in land-based adventures the way flight magic can be. As with flight, dispelling can be deadly if someone relies on magic to breathe underwater. It’s generally best to avoid having enemies who can breathe underwater dispelling the water-breathing magic aiding PCs. Though PCs might be able to use air bubble and quickly cast water breathing again, having this happen repeatedly can <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.706,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 737e46f3-087b-4f4d-85e9-70ff650c3594 -->

30 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.958,r=0.084,b=0.983), with ID 1cb22d70-73d4-40f8-833d-319e545129cb -->

be frustrating, and being forced to prepare an extremely
high-level *water breathing* spell to avoid it isn’t much fun
either. Lacking a swim Speed is easier to deal with, except
for characters with poor Athletics, who might need to
strategize around their shortcomings. The DC to Swim
underwater shouldn’t be very high—typically 15, or 13
in calm water. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.078,r=0.471,b=0.188), with ID 9b190a2e-2050-49d9-8d61-b701acbf05ea -->

When someone gets knocked out underwater, they usually float up or sink down. You decide based on their buoyancy; most adventurers carry a heavy enough load to sink. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.189,r=0.471,b=0.249), with ID 9a899471-774c-4bd1-ac4f-07264d1cb5e7 -->

When one group is in the water and another is outside
it, note that the aquatic combat rules for attacks apply
when either party is in water. You might decide that a
character in the water is concealed against someone
outside it due to distortion, and vice versa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.249,r=0.471,b=0.327), with ID 6bb9f2ba-de39-4c20-8fc3-23fa0812fa21 -->

Social Encounters  
Most conversations play best as free-form roleplaying, with maybe one or two checks for social skills involved. Sometimes, though, a tense situation or crucial parley requires a social encounter that uses initiative, much like a combat encounter. As with any other encounter, the stakes of a social encounter need to be high! A failed social encounter could mean a character is imprisoned or put to death, a major rival becomes a political powerhouse, or a key ally is disgraced and ostracized. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.337,r=0.471,b=0.494), with ID 4292d1a5-4039-4c85-b757-c1d6dfa85db2 -->

Using the structure of an encounter is helpful because it
makes the timing clearer than in free-form play, and each
character feels like they’re contributing. When running
a social encounter, establish the stakes up front, so the
players know the consequences of success or failure and
the circumstances that will cause the encounter to end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.495,r=0.470,b=0.586), with ID ed463a16-4f26-4703-b405-72f8b789ad7c -->

You have much more flexibility in how you run a social encounter than a combat encounter. Extending the length of rounds beyond 6 seconds, allowing more improvisation, and focusing less on special attacks and spells all differentiate a social encounter from a combative one. In most cases, you don’t need to worry about characters’ movements, nor do you need a map. Be flexible and encouraging as you run a social encounter, and don’t worry about nitty-gritty details like character movement except in extreme cases. Allow the PCs to share information about as freely as the players can around the table. If one character is watching the opponent for signs they’re lying, assume they can easily convey that to other characters subtly. It’s good to remind players of things their characters might know or be likely to notice even if the players, in the moment, don’t have them in mind. Describe NPCs’ mental states and ask for clarification about the PCs’ attitudes when needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.587,r=0.470,b=0.861), with ID 856c5fea-2832-46a9-8217-24ce92c07a12 -->

- Some examples of social encounters include:
- • Proving someone’s innocence in front of a judge
- • Convincing a neighboring monarch to help defend against an invasion
- • Besting a rival bard in a battle of wits <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.863,r=0.469,b=0.938), with ID 2282c72b-5e40-4d1a-9847-dd6ba4644c0a -->

- • Exposing a villain’s deception before a noble court
- • Disproving a rival’s scientific theories before an alchemists’ guild assembly
- • Ending a tense standoff <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.080,r=0.860,b=0.143), with ID 17b05f92-60ba-42a5-8e4b-8a569d7c58f5 -->

Non-Combat Level  
A creature’s level measures its acumen in combat, but some creatures who would be pushovers in battle can be dangerous in social encounters or other challenges! Such creatures typically have skill modifiers and mental defenses much higher than their levels would indicate. See page 128 for information on setting these statistics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.154,r=0.860,b=0.264), with ID 15a7bb0d-c824-48f6-aff3-8db7d6a4151d -->

Award XP for defeating an NPC in a social encounter
based on the relevant level rather than the creature’s
combat level. Such an NPC might have an ability similar
to the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.265,r=0.860,b=0.325), with ID 583e2dc1-a52e-44fc-a177-9561d8cb79f4 -->

**Courtroom Specialist** In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.327,r=0.859,b=0.357), with ID 278ca912-07b2-4227-97d6-beb079bc3d6c -->

## Initiative and Actions
Initiative in a social encounter typically has characters rolling Society or a Charisma-based skill, such as Diplomacy or Deception. As with other encounters, a character’s approach to the conflict determines which skill they roll. On a character’s turn, they typically get to attempt one roll, usually by using a skill action. Let the player roleplay what their character says and does, then determine what they’ll roll. Allow them to use any abilities or spells that might help them make their case, though keep in mind that when most people see the visual signs of a spell being cast, they think someone is using magic to try to influence or harm them, and they have a negative reaction. Generally speaking, a turn should go on just long enough for the character to make one salient point and attempt one check before moving to the next character in the initiative order. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.369,r=0.862,b=0.631), with ID 781d81e3-891d-4982-8671-658c018e963d -->

Good social encounters include an opposition. This can be direct, such as a rival who argues against the characters’ case, or passive, such as a mob that automatically becomes more unruly as each round passes. Give the opposition one or more positions in the initiative order so you can convey what it’s doing. You can create game statistics for the opposition, especially if it’s an individual, but in situations like that of the unruly mob, you might need nothing more than to establish a set of increasingly difficult DCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.633,r=0.860,b=0.785), with ID 3a77a3d9-2c38-4dee-939b-03d9baf31f68 -->

Measuring Success and Progress
You’ll need to decide how to measure the characters’
success in social encounters because there’s no AC to
target or HP to whittle down. Page 55 includes guidance
on setting DCs for social skill actions, often using a
target’s Will DC. If you need a DC for people who don’t
have stats, such as a crowd or an NPC for whom you
haven’t already generated statistics, use the guidelines
on setting DCs, found on page 52. You can either pick <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.799,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID fcb2c606-8141-438e-b311-7c3d83c67859 -->

### BYPASSED ENCOUNTERS
What happens if you’ve planned a fight or challenge and the PCs find a way to avoid it entirely? This could leave them behind in XP or cause them to miss important information or treasure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.090,r=0.500,b=0.172), with ID fba5278b-59a0-43f3-9639-3cf076a8cb64 -->

In the case of XP, the guidelines are simple: if the player characters avoided the challenge through smart tactical play, a savvy diplomatic exchange, clever use of magic, or another approach that required ingenuity and planning, award them the normal XP for the encounter. If they did something that took only moderate effort or was a lucky break, like finding a secret passage and using it to avoid a fight, award them XP for a minor or modest accomplishment. In an adventure that's more free-form, like a sprawling dungeon with multiple paths, there might be no reward for bypassing an encounter because doing so was trivial. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.173,r=0.501,b=0.356), with ID 9e55872f-040e-40de-847c-35bb2dfee93c -->

You’ll have to think on your feet if information or items get skipped when players bypass encounters. First, look for another reasonable place in the adventure to share the information or item. If it makes sense, move the original encounter to another part of the adventure and give the PCs a major advantage for bypassing the encounter in the first place. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.154,t=0.357,r=0.501,b=0.463), with ID f033d59b-6cd3-4a84-afcd-ced7e75c0764 -->

a simple DC or use a level-based DC, estimating a
level for the subject or how challenging it should be to
sway them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.496,r=0.512,b=0.540), with ID 1d386a1d-d7f5-4c58-80c2-4572980597ed -->

The attitude conditions—hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful—provide a useful way to track the progress of a social encounter. Use these to represent the attitude of an authority, a crowd, a jury, or similar. A typical goal for a social encounter is to change the attitude of a person or group to helpful so they assist you or calming a hostile group or person to defuse a situation. Try to give the players a clear idea of how much they’ve progressed as the encounter proceeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.541,r=0.512,b=0.677), with ID b733cfe1-14be-49e3-a033-4e69de0db45e -->

Another option is to track the number of successes or
failures the characters accrue, either using a subsystem
like Victory Points (page 184) or Influence (page 187),
or else something more ad hoc. For instance, you
might need to trick four guards into leaving their posts
and count each successful attempt to Lie or Create a
Diversion toward a total of four necessary successes.
You can also combine these two methods; if the PCs
need a group of important nobles to vote their way,
the goal of the encounter might be to ensure that a
majority of the nobles have a better attitude toward
the PCs than they have of a rival—all within a limited
time frame. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.679,r=0.512,b=0.876), with ID 862ee9c7-4a34-4aa3-8413-4a838b131b0f -->

Consequences  
When you set stakes at the start of a social encounter, give  
an idea of the consequences. Beyond whatever narrative <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.890,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 455f0d5e-551c-49b7-b408-5ffe0da9aa16 -->

benefits player characters might gain, a social encounter
usually includes an XP award. Because these are encounters
along the same lines as combat encounters, they grant
a sizable amount of XP, typically that of a moderate
accomplishment, or even a major accomplishment if the
encounter was the culmination of long-term plans or if a
significant adversary got their comeuppance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.188), with ID 5fe2590d-59b3-460e-978a-ecd08b87f67f -->

The outcome of a social encounter should direct
the story of the game. Look for repercussions. Which
NPCs might view the PCs more favorably now? Which
might hold a grudge or formulate a new plan? A social
encounter can seal the fate of an NPC and end their
story, but this isn’t true for player characters. Even if
something looks truly dire for them, such as a death
sentence, the social encounter isn’t the end—there’s still
time for desperate heroics or a twist in the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.189,r=0.903,b=0.325), with ID a3936502-f639-4b5d-a13d-d40cc353525c -->

# ENDING THE ENCOUNTER
A combat encounter typically ends when all the creatures on one side are killed or knocked unconscious. Once this happens, you can stop acting in initiative order. The surviving side then has ample time to ensure that everyone taken out stays down. However, you might need to keep using combat rounds if any player characters are near death, clinging to a cliff, or in some other situation where every moment matters for their survival. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.338,r=0.903,b=0.479), with ID dc549a9e-28ab-44a4-99a5-cc55dbca6deb -->

You can decide a fight is over if there’s no challenge
left and the player characters are just cleaning up the
last few weak enemies. However, avoid doing this if any
of the players still have inventive and interesting things
they want to try or spells they’re concentrating on—
ending an encounter early is a tool to avoid boredom,
not to deny someone their fun. You can end a fight early
in several ways: the foes can surrender, an adversary
can die before its Hit Points actually run out, or you
can simply say the battle is over and that the PCs easily
dispatch their remaining foes. In this last case, you might
ask, “Is everyone okay if we call the fight?” to make sure
your players are on board. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.481,r=0.903,b=0.677), with ID 281a823d-e13d-4e59-aeda-047651a970bd -->

One side might surrender when almost all its
members are defeated or if spells or skills thoroughly
demoralize them. Once there’s a surrender, come out of
initiative order and enter into a short negotiation. These
conversations are really about whether the winners will
show mercy to the losers or just kill or otherwise get
rid of them. The surrendering side usually doesn’t have
much leverage in these cases, so avoid long back-and-
forth discussions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.680,r=0.903,b=0.815), with ID e48ef666-75b0-4b8f-b91c-a4124df1439e -->

Fleeing Enemies  
Fleeing enemies can sometimes cause issues at the game table, as players often want to pursue them, thinking they might return as a threat later on. This can easily bog down the game and extend an encounter that has already reached its conclusion, so avoid playing this out move by move. If every adversary is fleeing, forgo <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.829,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 34499f52-54fe-48e7-8b9e-7f02f5bb8666 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a dramatic battle scene inside an icy cavern, featuring a large, red-skinned, armored demoness wielding a flaming sword, a smaller armored knight at her feet, and two additional figures rappelling down an ice wall in the background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a towering, red-skinned, horned demoness in ornate bronze armor, holding a flaming sword in her right hand and a dagger in her left.
  • The demoness is positioned centrally, dominating the composition, with one foot pinning down a smaller armored knight in white and red, who appears to be struggling or defeated.
  • In the background, two figures in armor are rappelling down a steep, icy wall, suggesting reinforcements or an ongoing battle.
  • The setting is an expansive ice cavern with jagged blue ice formations, golden ground, and dynamic lighting that highlights the action and contrasts the warm tones of the demoness with the cool environment.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement indicators.
  • The illustration uses vibrant colors: fiery oranges and reds for the demoness and her weapons, contrasted with icy blues and whites for the environment.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The demoness occupies the foreground, with the knight directly beneath her, emphasizing dominance and conflict.
  • The two rappelling figures are in the upper left background, providing depth and a sense of scale.
  • The composition uses diagonal lines (from the ice formations and the demoness’s sword) to create movement and tension.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of power imbalance, with the demoness clearly overpowering the knight.
  • The presence of additional figures in the background suggests an ongoing or escalating conflict.
  • The use of contrasting warm and cool colors enhances the drama and highlights the central figures against the icy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 6f86571d-695c-4559-87b1-1a7af50634f8 -->

initiative order and give each PC the option to pursue
any one fleeing foe. Each PC can declare one action,
spell, or other ability to use to try to keep up. Then,
compare the PC’s Speed to that of the target, assess how
much the pursuer’s chosen spell or ability would help,
and factor in any abilities the quarry has that would aid
escape. If you determine that the pursuer catches up, go
back into combat with the original initiative order. If
not, the quarry escapes for now. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.539,r=0.471,b=0.679), with ID 919172d3-c4d0-447a-a433-d2dce1591442 -->

Total Party Kills  
Perhaps the most feared of any outcome of a gaming session, a total party kill (TPK) can spell the end of an adventure or campaign. In a TPK, every member of the party dies. Think in advance about how comfortable you are with TPKs and discuss them with the other players. This can provide valuable insights into not only how you should handle one, but also the implied level of lethality the players expect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.688,r=0.471,b=0.831), with ID 637b1fef-7564-4dec-a070-445c01ab5609 -->

TPKs are rarely unavoidable. Usually it becomes
evident at some point during the session—whether to
everyone or only to you—that disaster looms. What
the players do with this insight is up to them, but you
have more control and can take steps to avoid the TPK.
For example, perhaps the PCs’ foe gets distracted by
something, an ally arrives to help the heroes, or the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.833,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID d07bdfa3-5048-4e72-97f3-1d0ec2148c02 -->

villain captures them instead of slaying them outright.  
The simplest path is to just allow a clear escape route  
the PCs can take—perhaps with a few characters still  
falling along the way. It isn’t entirely your responsibility  
to defuse the TPK, but offering such opportunities gives  
players more say in their characters’ fates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.541,r=0.861,b=0.632), with ID 4ace7ca3-d99a-4928-b03a-2e01022022a8 -->

Should a TPK occur anyway, the kind of game you’re
running should influence your approach to the situation.
For example, in a relatively story-light campaign
centered around dungeon crawling, a TPK is less of a
problem—the players simply form a new adventuring
party and take up where the dead ones left off. If you’re
running a story-intensive game in which each PC has a
personal stake in defeating the villain, saving the town,
or the like, a TPK could require you to rework multiple
plot threads. Here, you might use the story you have
in place; for example, a player’s new character might
be the sibling of their previous, slain character, thus
creating some continuity between the two characters
and ensuring that the new character still has a stake in
defeating the villain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.633,r=0.860,b=0.861), with ID 25ba9895-5bf3-4436-94aa-97748e0358d4 -->

Note that the game should continue only if the
players want it to. The premature end of an adventure
or campaign isn’t always a bad thing. If the group is
interested in moving on, there’s nothing wrong with
ending the campaign and starting something different. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.864,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID e56209cd-3e06-4bc5-80d3-8730ef73b962 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting a female elf adventurer in a trap-filled dungeon corridor, examining a pit trap with spikes and mechanical components.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a white-haired, pointy-eared female elf in red and gold studded leather armor, crouched and inspecting a sprung pit trap.
  • The setting is a dimly lit stone corridor with rectangular wall recesses and a sandy floor.
  • The pit trap in the foreground contains sharp metal spikes and a circular saw blade; a pressure plate and a spiked caltrop are visible nearby.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm browns, golds, and reds, with dramatic shadowing and focused lighting on the character and trap.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The image includes fantasy-themed equipment: a bladed chain weapon and a green-tinted metal plate on the ground.
  • The upper left corner features a stylized dragon illustration and the "Pathfinder GM Core" title.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is positioned in the lower center, kneeling with one hand on the ground and the other near her face, closely examining the trap.
  • The pit trap occupies the lower right foreground, with its open lid and visible spikes drawing the viewer’s eye.
  • The corridor recedes into the background, creating depth and a sense of exploration.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a tense, investigative moment typical of dungeon-delving scenarios, emphasizing caution and the dangers of traps.
  • The composition highlights the character’s focus and preparedness, with equipment and environmental hazards reinforcing the theme of adventuring peril. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.004,r=0.998,b=0.521), with ID e6e12722-d9af-4b6c-8ea5-99c168ef79eb -->

# RUNNING EXPLORATION

_Exploration mode is the connective tissue of your adventure or quest—everything that happens as the characters move between encounters. It could be looking for a rare book in a library, trailblazing through a spooky forest, fortifying a castle before a monster attack, or canvassing the city for a missing person._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.131,t=0.537,r=0.912,b=0.645), with ID 92dc370e-87ef-4599-9f9d-6d63d7e75b48 -->

Fundamentally, exploration is all about rewarding the
PCs for learning about their surroundings. To facilitate
this, it’s especially important to have and to convey a
clear mental picture of the group’s surroundings. You’ll
be better able to keep track of where the players are and
describe the sights, sounds, and other sensations of their
adventuring locales. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.677,r=0.515,b=0.785), with ID d7c35ce4-b8dc-40e4-b452-f0433a2a140c -->

Exploration mode is intentionally less regimented
than encounters are. As a result, you’ll be making
many more judgment calls during exploration on just
about everything that happens as you build the world
and describe how it changes in response to the players’
actions. Encourage the players to have their characters
truly explore, and reward their curiosity. The things they
try to do in exploration mode show you what they’re
interested in and what they consider important. As you
play, you’ll get a good feel for the aspects of exploration <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.786,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID b3031abf-4252-4949-bca8-0e03a59dbbf6 -->

that intrigue certain players, and you can add more  
of those things to your adventures or emphasize these  
points in published adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.679,r=0.905,b=0.724), with ID 919391f8-9cee-4897-9479-3d566a2e6c4b -->

**Stakes:** Low to moderate. Exploration mode should be used when there’s some amount of risk, but no immediate danger. The PCs might be in an environment where they’re likely to face monsters or hazards, but they usually stay in exploration mode until they enter a fight or engage in some other direct interaction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.725,r=0.905,b=0.816), with ID 855d78ec-41b2-4dde-9667-2e88986cd409 -->

**Time Scale:** When the PCs are in exploration mode, time in the game world passes much faster than real-world time at the table, so it’s rarely measured out to the second or the minute. You can speed up or slow down how quickly things are happening as needed. If it’s important to know exactly how much time is passing, you can usually estimate time spent in exploration mode to 10-minute increments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.817,r=0.905,b=0.938), with ID 0b24dba3-2cfd-4639-9b4a-599879d89a7a -->

34 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.958,r=0.085,b=0.983), with ID 3cb6656f-1e24-439f-8efd-1fcdaa86798b -->

RUNNING THE GAME <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.019,r=0.868,b=0.043), with ID c940b5f7-c8e6-4aaa-a10c-97364f579db8 -->

**Actions and Reactions:** Though exploration isn’t broken into rounds, exploration activities assume the PCs are spending part of their time using actions, such as Seeking or Interacting. If they have specific actions they want to use, they should ask; you can decide whether the actions apply and whether to switch to encounter mode for greater detail. PCs can use any relevant reactions that come up during exploration mode. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.472,b=0.205), with ID 5329f8e7-aaf6-4c85-a342-dd1cae7ff3ac -->

# SCENES WITHIN EXPLORATION
It can help you to think of exploration as a series of scenes, where encounters break up exploration and function as subsections within it. Many of these are based on geography, for example, with exploring a series of dungeon corridors as one scene and entering the dungeon’s great hall kicking off another. Other times, you’ll break out of a scene at a point of interest. If the PCs decide to stop their travels and investigate a statue, think of that as a new scene. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.213,r=0.471,b=0.371), with ID 6a0204cb-2a67-4d86-909f-f7f7ff77f42e -->

This gives you a good point to describe the transition
between scenes. Describe what was happening to
reinforce where the group was, then describe what they
now face to show the change. For example, “You’ve
been making your way through this long hallway, but
after a moment of debate, you stop, your footsteps and
voices still echoing down the hall. The stone statue
before you is seven feet high and adorned with rubies.
It represents... maybe a god? Its face is damaged and
broken. What do you do?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.373,r=0.471,b=0.525), with ID 50d4f7d4-a039-4533-a2ae-b0c10e12b9cc -->

When playing out a scene, your initial description
should set the expectation of what level of detail the
scene might go into, with you and the players adjusting
as needed during play. Since players aren’t bound in
a strict initiative order in exploration mode, it can be
useful to proactively call on PCs to avoid everybody
talking at once. If possible, start with someone who
instigated the scene change, or perhaps with the PC
using the most relevant exploration activity, like a PC
Investigating artwork or Searching for secrets in the
example above. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.526,r=0.470,b=0.693), with ID d186b901-587a-4e9c-ab72-883ab4b0cb1c -->

While the number of scenes that could take place
during exploration is limited only by your imagination
and your players’ actions, there are some common types
of scenes that often come up, which are detailed below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.693,r=0.470,b=0.756), with ID 8d58f1a2-1b43-4612-b87e-995917e15dc7 -->

Daily Preparations  
Just before setting out to explore, or after a night’s rest, the PCs spend time to prepare for the adventuring day. This typically happens over the span of 30 minutes to an hour in the morning, but only after 8 full hours of rest. Daily preparations include the following.  
• Spellcasters who prepare spells choose which spells they’ll have available that day.  
• Focus Points and other abilities that reset during daily preparations refresh. This includes abilities that can be used only a certain number of times per day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.767,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 061e7a62-b1ce-4efd-8883-346890934035 -->

## GM PRIORITIES
The following points will be good to keep in mind to create a fun and smooth experience as your players go about exploring the world.
- • Evoke the setting with vivid sensory details.
- • Shift the passage of time to emphasize tension and uncertainty, and speed past uneventful intervals.
- • Get players to add details by asking for their reactions.
- • Present small-scale mysteries to intrigue players and spur investigation.
- • When rolls are needed, look for ways to move the action forward, or add interesting wrinkles on a failure.
- • Plan effective transitions to encounters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.075,r=0.861,b=0.309), with ID bd028eb3-ebc2-4d9b-9265-4bc1e92eb03b -->

- • Each character equips their gear. This includes donning their armor and strapping on their weapons.
- • Characters invest up to 10 worn magic items to gain their benefits for the day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.325,r=0.861,b=0.389), with ID 71b49955-183d-4c44-a5f3-cb2d021f6821 -->

Beyond making these mechanical decisions, daily
preparations can be a good time to check in to see
how players might think their characters are feeling.
The twentieth morning of a long voyage might see the
characters wearily strapping on their boots and armor
as listlessness sets in, but the sun rising over a hill as
the invading skeleton army finally arrives to lay siege to
their city could have a tense air of fear or might taste of
the rush before a glorious last stand. Use this time to set
the stage for the adventuring day to come! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.402,r=0.861,b=0.556), with ID 6ddba5ea-41ab-4984-b0f5-a452e452c20d -->

## Hazards
The task of looking for and disarming hazards comes up frequently in exploration and is an example of a type of exploration scene. Hazards don’t usually appear out of nowhere. A trap might be on a door’s lock, at a specific bend in a corridor, or so on. You could have a pit trap in the middle of a large room, but a surprise that’s entirely unexpected can be pretty unsatisfying. The same pit trap appearing in the middle of a 10-foot-wide, suspiciously featureless hallway can make the players say, “Okay, we should have seen that coming,” with even that minimal amount of foreshadowing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.568,r=0.860,b=0.754), with ID 230cb38c-8527-4409-a1f3-7e5447fb7180 -->

When a complex hazard triggers, move to encounter
mode. Simple hazards are usually dealt with in
exploration mode, but that doesn’t mean that they should
be glossed over. Clearly depict what action by a PC sets
off the hazard and what happens as the hazard activates,
and illustrate any aftereffects. PCs have many ways to
heal themselves, so keep in mind that a damaging hazard
won’t always have a huge effect. They tend to work
best if their activation might alert creatures in the area,
lock the PCs out of an area, or cause a similar narrative
setback beyond just damage or another condition easily
removed outside of the pressure of combat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.756,r=0.859,b=0.938), with ID d85738b4-b086-4006-ad85-196053b5a87e -->

Searching for Traps  
PCs usually have a better chance to detect hazards while exploring if they’re using the Search activity (and the Detect Magic activity, in the case of some magic traps). If a PC detects a hazard and wants to disable it, slow down a bit. Ask the player to describe what the PC is doing and provide concrete details about how their efforts pan out to make it feel more real. It’s good if the player sweats a little bit! It’s supposed to be a tense situation, after all. If a hazard requires multiple checks to disable, it’s good to describe what happens with each success to show incremental progress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.076,r=0.516,b=0.266), with ID fce8e26a-e4af-4c5e-8d41-d61d2c050827 -->

Summary : This image combines a decorative illustration of a brass spyglass with a textual explanation about how to present clues during investigation scenes in tabletop roleplaying games.

illustration:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a brass spyglass with a compass rose design etched on its side, shown in a three-quarters perspective.
  • The spyglass is rendered with realistic shading and metallic highlights, suggesting a polished, well-crafted object.
  • The illustration is placed in the upper right corner, partially overlapping the text.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement is present.
  • The illustration is integrated into a book or magazine layout, with text wrapping around it.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The spyglass is in the foreground, angled from lower left to upper right.
  • The text is in the background, with the illustration breaking the rectangular boundary of the text block.

Analysis : 
  • The visual of the spyglass reinforces the theme of investigation and searching for clues, as described in the adjacent text. The compass rose motif further suggests exploration and discovery. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.276,r=0.516,b=0.556), with ID 15d208ed-2cba-4ea2-bf72-ee9e2882c6c6 -->

If these details pique a player’s interest, you can go
into a more detailed investigation. They might look
at the runes more closely, chip away at the plaster, or
search around for a representation of Norgorber’s fourth
aspect. Avoid calling for checks if it’s not necessary. In the
last example, you’d likely tell them which of the deity’s
aspects is missing without another Religion check, and if
the aspect is represented as a statue in the room, asking
for a Perception check to find it might short-circuit the
investigation in an uninteresting way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.556,r=0.513,b=0.708), with ID 96cdbd83-4b99-4e11-9906-bf9ea91a5203 -->

Though one person starts the investigation, getting
others involved can help them become more interested
and bring different skills to bear to get other types of
information. Reward collaboration and clever ideas. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.709,r=0.513,b=0.771), with ID 64b49a04-6838-4afb-b1d2-3770968ed10c -->

Roleplaying Investigations  
To make the investigation feel real, it helps to talk a player through their character’s thought processes by saying what clue inspired them to think of an important detail, explaining what the detail is, and possibly mentioning further questions that this detail raises. Let the player extrapolate their own conclusion rather than giving them the answers outright. Even if the investigation doesn’t lead to an unambiguous conclusion, the players should feel they’re more informed than when they started. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.783,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 68f3a492-07df-444e-9ca6-cb708be37883 -->

Travel  
Long journeys are staples of the fantasy genre, but they take work to be fun in play, especially if the timeline the PCs are on isn’t urgent. Use encounters and special scenes only if there’s something compelling to cover. It’s perfectly fine to fast-forward through exploration to get to the next stage of an adventure. That said, you should keep in mind that if any players have invested in exploration-themed abilities for their characters, those abilities should still matter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.904,b=0.234), with ID c991e1a9-73fc-45f1-be76-80dd4c294d3c -->

You can usually move through a travel scene pretty quickly. For a journey that takes multiple days, you might need to have the group Subsist if they run out of food. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.235,r=0.904,b=0.296), with ID b66e4b10-1c10-4f49-92f6-810445bae5c7 -->

## Travel Speed
Depending on how you track movement, the adventuring party might track the distance they travel in feet or miles based on the characters’ Speeds with the relevant movement type. Typical rates are shown on the Travel Speed table.

The rates on the Travel Speed table assume that the characters are traveling over flat and clear terrain at a determined pace, but one that’s not exhausting. Moving through difficult terrain halves the listed movement rate. Greater difficult terrain reduces the distance traveled to one-third the listed amount. If the travel requires a skill check to accomplish, such as mountain climbing or swimming, you might call for a check once per hour, referencing the resulting distance on the Travel Speed table to determine the group’s progress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.448,r=0.903,b=0.602), with ID 5936d602-8036-4e44-b4c9-5ca7cf9ec9ee -->

Navigating  
The Sense Direction activity uses Survival to find which way is north. You can combine this with Recalling Knowledge about the area—typically using Nature or Society—for the PCs to get their initial bearings.

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting an ancient, multi-level city or fortress carved into a rocky mountainside, illuminated by golden sunlight streaming from above. The scene is viewed from within a large cavern or opening, looking outward and upward toward the city structures.

photo:  
Scene Overview :  
  • The main subject is a vast, multi-tiered architectural complex built into a rocky cliff, featuring numerous arches, columns, and terraces.  
  • The setting is arid and mountainous, with warm, golden sunlight filtering through the opening at the top, casting dramatic shadows and highlights.  
  • The composition is dynamic, with the viewer's perspective from inside a cave or shaded area, looking out toward the sunlit city.  
  • The color palette consists of warm earth tones—yellows, oranges, and browns—contrasted by the dark shadows of the cave interior.

Technical Details :  
  • No scale bar or explicit measurement references are present.  
  • The illustration style is detailed and semi-realistic, with careful attention to architectural and environmental features.  
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • Foreground: Two figures stand at the cave's edge—one on the left in armor holding a spear, and one on the right in draped robes.  
  • Midground: Suspended wooden platforms or lifts hang from ropes, suggesting vertical movement between levels.  
  • Background: The city extends upward, with multiple levels of arches and structures carved into the rock, culminating in a sunlit opening at the top.  
  • The scene uses strong perspective lines, drawing the eye from the dark foreground to the illuminated city and sky above.

Analysis :  
  • The illustration conveys a sense of mystery and grandeur, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the ancient city.  
  • The interplay of light and shadow highlights the architectural details and the verticality of the space.  
  • The presence of figures and suspended platforms suggests human activity and the use of mechanical means to traverse the city's heights.  
  • The overall mood is one of awe and discovery, as if the viewer is encountering a lost or hidden civilization. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.060,r=0.875,b=0.522), with ID 04ddfabe-bb80-43c0-9268-09c35bf88e66 -->

wilderness. As the PCs try to find their path forward, think of ways to include notable landmarks they can seek out or stumble upon. Some of these might be useful, such as a great tree off in the distance that they can climb to get a better vantage point or a mountain slope where multiple plumes of smoke billow up, which might lead them toward a settlement. Others might be mysterious or dangerous, such as haunted glades or an animal’s hunting grounds. When the PCs first look around or scout, pick two or three landmarks to point out. Let the group decide on their course from there. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.538,r=0.471,b=0.711), with ID bdfc1974-a988-4f40-aaa8-b899d16cf394 -->

Getting Lost  
When PCs are exploring the wilderness or navigating twisting dungeon corridors, they might get lost. This is most likely as a consequence for failing at Survival or similar checks, but it can also happen based on the story, such as if they drop out of a portal in some strange land or come up from an underground passageway into a forest. Playing through the process of wandering in the wilderness and trying to find their way can be fun for a party, provided they do so for a fairly short interval. If a party is lost at the start of a session, they should usually have found their way and reached a significant destination by the end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.720,r=0.471,b=0.907), with ID 10d3998e-3c0e-4ef4-8d43-6cc3e7f918fe -->

these cases, have someone come to them! They might get
captured by local humanoids or monsters or even stumble
upon a dangerous location. They’ve figured out where they
are, even if it’s not where they wanted to be! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.541,r=0.862,b=0.603), with ID 5426ed36-90cd-47ea-8c69-166671bd5981 -->

Encounters During Travel
You might want to include some encounters if the PCs are in a dangerous area, especially if they travel for a long time. For these encounters, choose creatures that live in that type of environment. Remember that not all creatures attack on sight. Friendly or cautious creatures might approach the characters, resulting in more interactive scenes that might even help the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.614,r=0.862,b=0.740), with ID 70b7b67e-7fc2-42d1-bb11-62ec74cf156d -->

**Adverse Weather and Terrain**  
Exploration gets slower when the party faces dense jungles, deep snow, sandstorms, extreme heat, or similar difficult conditions. You decide how much these factors impact the characters’ progress. The specific effects of certain types of terrain and weather are described starting on page 90. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.751,r=0.861,b=0.863), with ID c15a6745-3cd3-463e-8e69-eb987d39e987 -->

Difficult Terrain  
Difficult terrain such as thick undergrowth usually slows down progress. Unless it’s important how far the group gets in a particular time frame, this can be covered with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.875,r=0.860,b=0.941), with ID f535530f-cf21-45bc-9c3d-524f92ec1250 -->

Hazardous Terrain  
Hazardous terrain, such as the caldera of an active volcano, might physically harm the player characters. The group might have the option to travel directly through or to go around by spending more time. You can transition into a more detailed scene while the characters move through hazardous terrain and attempt to mitigate the damage with spells or skill checks. If they endure hazardous terrain, consider giving the PCs a minor or moderate XP reward at the end of their exploration, with slightly more XP if they took smart precautions to avoid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.170,r=0.515,b=0.343), with ID d3f3aa76-bc2d-4ed6-bf37-b55db1940b0d -->

Environmental Hazards  
Dangerous crevasses, swampy bogs, quicksand, and similar dangers are environmental hazards, which are described beginning on page 90. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.353,r=0.514,b=0.419), with ID 14567809-b75b-48af-87f5-47bd58e365d7 -->

## Surprise Attacks
Surprise attacks should be used sparingly, even in dangerous areas. The fact that PCs are usually in a group scares away most animals, and setting a watch can deter even more attackers. Surprise attacks are most likely if the PCs did something in advance that would lead to the ambush. For instance, they might be ambushed by bandits if they were flaunting their wealth or showing off expensive items earlier in the session, or they might be counterattacked by enemies if they attack the enemies first, only to retreat to rest. If the PCs set up camp hastily and decide not to set a watch, they might be in trouble if they’re attacked. This should happen only in cases of extreme sloppiness, since if you take advantage of minor lapses, you might end up with a group that repeatedly spends an inordinate amount of time describing all their camping preparation to keep it from happening again. It’s usually better to ask the PCs if they’re setting up watches (page 43), rather than assume that their silence on the issue means they aren’t. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.429,r=0.514,b=0.740), with ID f5efc999-6629-4040-addb-8a9cc76b786a -->

Starting Encounters  
If an encounter begins, you’ll need to shift to encounter
mode by having everyone roll initiative, as described
on page 24. Call for initiative once a trap is triggered,
as soon as two opposing groups come into contact,
or when a creature on one side decides to take action
against the other. In some cases, a trap or a foe has a
reaction that tells you to roll initiative. For instance, a
complex trap that’s triggered might make an attack with
its reaction before the initiative order begins. In these
cases, resolve all the results of the reaction before calling
for initiative rolls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.751,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 681822cc-9597-4923-abe1-11fc5a1b6cc5 -->

# FLESHING OUT EXPLORATION
The more narrative pace of exploration mode means that you, as the GM, have a lot of freedom to emphasize important parts of the adventure to your players through evocative language and dramatic timing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.075,r=0.905,b=0.159), with ID b7f09605-ab72-4a38-9025-249c99214e88 -->

Evocative Environments  
As the PCs explore, convey their surroundings by appealing to the players’ senses. This sets the scene, gives them a better sense of their environment, and can be used to foreshadow what they might find ahead. When determining which details to cover, think about what’s familiar versus novel. A new dungeon might have similar architecture to previous ones but feature ancient structures that set it apart. You can use the PCs’ familiarity as a tool to single out what’s new. When preparing for a game, imagine yourself in the environment and jot down a few notes about what you would sense. Conveying these details keeps the players on the same page about what they sense, even if each character responds to it differently. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.169,r=0.905,b=0.402), with ID 10350a50-7679-4e39-8e7a-a03204e93414 -->

Keep in mind that the more you explain something,
the more important it seems. This is valuable for you
to drive interest, but can also be a mixed blessing, since
describing something inconsequential to set the mood
can lead players off on a tangent. Sometimes, the best
solution is to find a way to make that unimportant thing
as important as the players think it is! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.403,r=0.905,b=0.510), with ID 3962274a-0c92-46ce-b177-6db96bc7592e -->

Flow of Time  
Exploration mode is rarely measured down to the second or minute. If someone asks how long something takes, the nearest 10-minute increment typically does the job. (For long voyages or similar activities, the nearest hour might be more appropriate.) You convey the passage of time through your descriptions, but not just by addressing it outright. In a roleplaying game, information and time are linked. Time will seem to slow down the more detail you give. Think cinematically! A long voyage through a series of tunnels works well as a montage, whereas progress searching a statue for traps could be relayed as a series of distressing details in quick succession and would feel more tense due to that precision. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.521,r=0.903,b=0.739), with ID b43f9450-843c-4e2e-b30e-29db09a99d79 -->

With that in mind, when is it best to speed up or
slow down the passage of game time? Usually, you’ll
slow down and give more description when you’re
establishing something or progressing the story. When
the PCs enter a dungeon or a new area, describe how it
feels, slowing down to give the players a sense of what’s
ahead. When a PC stops to do something important or
makes a key decision, slowing down gives that moment
its desired weight. You can also adjust the flow of time
to reflect PCs’ mental states. As a PC returns home
after decades away, you might pause to ask the player
what their PC is feeling, matching time to the rush of
memories and emotions filling that PC’s thoughts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.741,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 8f45db80-0e90-429a-962b-65c0bd4b234a -->

# Exploration Activities
In exploration mode, each player who wants to do something beyond just traveling chooses an exploration activity for their character. The most common activities are Avoid Notice, Detect Magic, Hustle, and Search, though there are many other options available (detailed on page 438 of _Player Core_). The purpose of these activities within the game is to clarify what a PC focuses on as they explore rather than unrealistically allowing them do all things simultaneously. This adds variety within the group’s behavior and can show you where players want the story to go. For example, a player whose PC is Investigating carvings on the walls shows you that the player wants those to be informative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.688,r=0.472,b=0.908), with ID 302d9380-95d6-4f10-981b-32d24a10565c -->

foremost, with the player describing to you what they’re
doing, and then you determining which activity applies
and describing any details or alterations for the situation.
If a player says, “I’m Avoiding Notice,” add more detail by
asking what precautions they’re taking or by telling them
which passages they think are least guarded. Likewise, if
a player says they’re looking for traps and keeping their
shield raised and covering the group’s tracks, ask them
which of these they are prioritizing to narrow down the

activity given current circumstances. For instance, someone

their group can reach them, or someone Investigating
ancient hieroglyphs might critically fail and lead the party

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting an adventuring party exploring a dense, mysterious jungle environment, with a focus on a character investigating a vine-covered stone structure.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a small group of adventurers in a lush, overgrown jungle.
  • Central focus is on a character with wild hair and tribal attire, holding a torch and reaching toward a stone structure covered in moss and vines.
  • A large feline companion (possibly a jaguar or leopard) stands alert on a fallen log above another adventurer.
  • The color palette is dominated by deep reds, purples, and greens, creating a mystical and foreboding atmosphere.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the torch casting a warm glow on the stone and the characters.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • No on-image text or UI elements, aside from the "Pathfinder GM Core" branding at the top.
  • The illustration is detailed, with careful attention to foliage, character gear, and the interplay of light and shadow.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character with the torch is positioned at the center, slightly elevated, interacting directly with the stone structure.
  • The large feline is above and behind, poised on a log, suggesting readiness and alertness.
  • Another adventurer is crouched in the foreground, partially obscured by foliage, with visible weapons and gear.
  • The background recedes into dense jungle, with twisted tree branches and thick undergrowth framing the scene.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of exploration, danger, and teamwork in a fantasy jungle setting.
  • The composition draws the viewer's eye to the interaction between the torch-bearing character and the mysterious stone, suggesting the discovery of a hidden entrance or ancient ruin.
  • The presence of the animal companion and the readiness of the party members imply preparedness for potential threats.
  • The use of warm and cool colors enhances the mood of mystery and adventure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.005,t=0.011,r=0.994,b=0.521), with ID 6430e63b-0c2d-4fff-b6dd-31c4efbc0d14 -->

Here are some useful things to keep in mind when
adjudicating a few specific exploration activities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.232,r=0.472,b=0.267), with ID d1490084-767d-456a-a2ec-b9e1f97043db -->

Detect Magic  
This activity doesn’t enable characters to automatically find every single magical aura or object during travel. Hazards that require a minimum proficiency can’t be found with *detect magic*, nor can illusions of equal or higher rank than the spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.276,r=0.471,b=0.371), with ID b59c1783-d138-4a35-8278-d774ff1afcd4 -->

When characters find something magical using this activity, let them know and give them the option to stop and explore further or continue on. Stopping brings you into a more roleplay-heavy scene in which players can search through an area, assess different items, or otherwise try to figure out the source of the magic and what it does. Continuing on might cause the group to miss out on beneficial magic items or trigger a magic trap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.372,r=0.472,b=0.496), with ID 1dcfb5e6-66fa-4dba-a0e6-c21da28ba754 -->

Follow the Expert

Follow the Expert is a truly versatile activity that lets a PC who’s lacking at a skill or exploration activity have a better chance to succeed. It provides a good way to help a character with a low Stealth modifier sneak around, to get a character with poor Athletics up a steep cliff, and so on. Usually, a character who is Following the Expert can’t perform other exploration activities or follow more than one person at a time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.505,r=0.471,b=0.647), with ID d539d300-d997-41e4-9317-54c1ecdef894 -->

It’s important that this doesn’t become too rote. Let the players decide how one of them is helping out the other. The description can give you more to work with and add fun color to the exploration beyond just the mechanics. Also, if one PC helps another in the same way over and over, that could be a sign of the character being helped growing in a particular way. If the rogue has been helping the fighter Avoid Notice over and over, the fighter is essentially receiving training in Stealth at that point and might want to consider taking or retraining a skill increase to make that true. Connections like these can breathe life into the characters and their relationships, and it can help promote camaraderie and interactions between characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.648,r=0.471,b=0.862), with ID 0c2575c8-b0fc-4382-931a-da2916dbb681 -->

Investigate  
As with Searching or Detecting Magic, the initial result of Investigating is usually enough to give the investigator a clue that leads into a more thorough examination, but <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.874,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 58d17639-cb5a-418e-b2a9-9904e691e97e -->

# MONITORING SPELL DURATIONS
Spell durations are approximate values that codify the vagaries and eccentricities of magic into a convenient number. However, that doesn’t mean you can set your watch by a spell with a 1-hour duration. This is one of the reasons the passage of time outside of encounters is in your hands and isn’t as precise as encounter rounds. If a question arises about whether a spell has expired, you make the call. You shouldn’t be punitive, but you also shouldn’t treat characters like they move with clockwork precision and perfect efficiency between encounters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.084,r=0.851,b=0.264), with ID 3b65bcad-b402-4ab9-8f9e-d58043e583e6 -->

There are two times these durations matter most: when players try to fit multiple encounters within the duration of a spell, and when they want to use a spell before a fight and keep it in effect during the encounter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.265,r=0.849,b=0.328), with ID 37f9b85d-5976-4041-9508-57c022d4bff2 -->

Multiple Encounters  
A 1-minute spell should last for multiple encounters only if the encounters happen in very close proximity (usually in two adjoining rooms) and if the PCs go directly from one fight to the next without leaving encounter mode. If they want to stop and heal, or if the party debates whether to go on, the process takes enough time that the spell runs out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.338,r=0.847,b=0.463), with ID 0e112a28-7a19-4a60-a142-65f5cf80dbf4 -->

Be more generous with spells lasting 10 minutes or more. A 10-minute spell easily lasts for one encounter and could continue for another if the locations are close. A 1-hour spell usually lasts for several encounters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.465,r=0.847,b=0.525), with ID 25836304-115e-4bed-bf63-0e74e0b31d5e -->

### Before a Fight
Casting advantageous spells before a fight (sometimes called “pre-buffing”) gives the characters a big advantage, since they can spend more combat rounds on offensive actions instead of preparatory ones. If the players have the drop on their foes, you usually can let each character cast one spell or prepare in some similar way, then roll initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.538,r=0.847,b=0.661), with ID 5a6f8900-dd2a-4e85-86bf-707700e1e8a5 -->

Casting preparatory spells before combat becomes
a problem when it feels rote and the players assume
it will always work—that sort of planning can't hold up
in every situation! In many cases, the act of casting
spells gives away the party's presence. In cases where
the PCs' preparations could give them away, you might
roll for initiative before everyone can complete their
preparations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.664,r=0.848,b=0.783), with ID 0352da56-c5af-43c9-aa10-1e0d936ba64a -->

it rarely gives all possible information. For instance, a
character might note that the walls of a dungeon are covered
with Chthonian writing, but they would need to stop to read
the text or even determine that it’s written in blood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.817,r=0.859,b=0.878), with ID 12b9edf3-dc26-459e-aa4e-3268712b8184 -->

Search
With a successful Perception check while Searching, a character notices the presence or absence of something <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.890,r=0.858,b=0.940), with ID b3bb2b2c-3b80-4f58-8f7e-694a6001798c -->

unusual in the area, but this doesn’t provide a
comprehensive catalog of everything there. Instead,
it gives a jumping-off point for closer inspection or an
encounter. For instance, if an area has both a DC 30 secret
door and a DC 25 trap, and a Searching character got a 28
on their Perception check, you would tell the player that
their character noticed a trap in the area, and you’d give
a rough idea of the trap’s location and nature. The party
needs to examine the area more closely to learn specifics
about the trap, and someone would need to Search again
to get another chance to find the secret door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.078,r=0.515,b=0.249), with ID 98ae016e-48ef-4973-94fb-f71d5c246405 -->

If an area contains many objects or something that will take a while to search (such as a cabinet full of papers), Searching would reveal the cabinet, but the PCs would have to examine it more thoroughly to check the papers. This usually requires the party to stop for a complete search. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.249,r=0.515,b=0.341), with ID b0d209e9-ea03-4db1-ac12-4f9ae4684e5a -->

You roll a secret Perception check for a Searching
character to detect any secrets they pass that are hidden
in a place that stands out (such as near a door or a turn
in a corridor), but not one that’s in a more inconspicuous
place (like a random point in a long hallway) unless they
are searching particularly slowly and meticulously. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.342,r=0.514,b=0.433), with ID 9319943e-4d40-4858-a8ce-0bb6dc0538ee -->

The rules for Searching deliberately avoid giving
intricate detail on how long a search takes. That’s left
in your hands because the circumstances of a search can
vary widely. If the group isn’t in any danger and has time
for a really thorough search, that’s a good time to allow
them to automatically succeed, rather than bothering to
roll, or you might have them roll to see how long it takes
before they find what they’re looking for, ultimately
finding it eventually no matter the result. Conversely,
if they stop for a thorough search in the middle of a
dungeon, that’s a good time for their efforts to draw
unwanted attention! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.434,r=0.513,b=0.616), with ID c8f24c16-8018-4f10-9cbc-b868adb7aec7 -->

PCs might get to attempt another check if their initial
search is a bust. But when do you allow them to try
again? It’s best to tie this to taking a different tactic. Just
saying “I search it again” isn’t enough, but if a PC tries
a different method or has other tools at their disposal,
it could work. Be generous with what you allow, as long
as the player puts thought into it! If you know a search
isn’t going to turn up anything useful, make that clear
early on so the group doesn’t waste too much time on it.
If they’re determined to keep going—which they often
are—you might have them find something useful but
minor in the search. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.618,r=0.513,b=0.800), with ID 0685f677-ae7d-4653-b71d-9b39b132ece2 -->

**Improvising New Activities**
The list of exploration activities isn’t exhaustive. More appear in special subsystems and adventures, and you’ll often need to create your own. When making your own, it’s usually fine to just consider whether the amount of effort the PC has to put in is comparable to the other exploration activities and go from there. If you’re having trouble, try finding a comparable activity. For example, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.812,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID ff1a81b4-b4e2-4b47-82ad-72f6db1e0c32 -->

if the PC are Swimming as they explore, consider that
travel speeds are based on the equivalent of 1 action per
6 seconds, and that other exploration activities the PCs
can keep up without getting tired are generally based on
alternating between 2 actions per 12 seconds, averaging
to 1 action per 6 seconds. (Defend, for example, is based
on using 1 action to Stride then 1 to Raise your Shield,
which is why the PC moves at half Speed.) Hustle is a good
example of an activity that can’t be done indefinitely, so
you can use it as a model for strenuous activities where the
PCs are using the equivalent of 2 actions every 6 seconds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.248), with ID 6d088161-58c3-4408-aad9-5b2adaa53841 -->

When improvising an exploration activity, have in
mind some advantages and disadvantages of that activity
to inspire you. What else might the PC be neglecting while
doing this activity? How does it interplay with activities
that the rest of the party uses? If the new activity seems
like it’s a better option than other activities all or nearly
all the time, chances are you might want to adjust it so
it’s more balanced. Eventually, you’ll start to find which
exploration activities your group enjoys the most. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.250,r=0.904,b=0.388), with ID 2081ac32-9914-44c4-83e0-b053ca5ce8de -->

# SETTING A PARTY ORDER
In exploration mode, it often matters which characters are in the front or back of the party formation. Let the players decide among themselves where in the group their characters are while exploring. This order can determine who gets attacked first when enemies or traps threaten from various directions. It’s up to you to determine the specifics of who gets targeted based on the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.399,r=0.904,b=0.525), with ID f62716ae-130c-49e4-b4da-bb70ff0d288a -->

When you come out of exploration mode, the group
usually remains in the same general formation. Decide
the PCs’ exact positions, with their input, if you’re
moving to a grid (as usually happens at the start of a
combat encounter). If they come out of exploration
mode on their own terms, they can move around as they
see fit. For example, if they detect a trap and the rogue
starts attempting to disarm it, the other characters can
move to whatever locations they think are safe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.527,r=0.904,b=0.662), with ID e9a04933-7168-47b6-826a-676f6a582759 -->

- **Resting**
- Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day. Though resting typically happens at night, a group gains the same benefits for resting during the day. Either way, they can gain the benefits of resting only once every 24 hours. A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the following ways.
  - • The character regains Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by their level. If they rest without any shelter or comfort, you might reduce this healing by half (to a minimum of 1 HP).
  - • The character loses the fatigued condition.
  - • The character reduces the severity of the doomed and drained conditions by 1.
  - • Most spellcasters need to rest before they regain their spells for the day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.676,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID a3fb91ed-964c-41da-82c1-a4262a74265e -->

  • In the background, a human figure in medieval-style clothing is reclining under a simple lean-to made of wooden poles and thatch.
  • The setting is among mossy, overgrown stone ruins with arched windows and broken walls, surrounded by a dense forest.
  • The lighting is warm and focused on the campfire, casting an orange glow on the goblin and the immediate area, while the background is shaded in cool blues and greens.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration uses a painterly style with detailed textures on stone, foliage, and clothing.
  • The color palette contrasts the warm firelight with the cool, shadowy ruins and forest.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The goblin and campfire are in the left foreground, occupying the lower left third of the image.
  • The human companion is in the right midground, under the shelter, partially in shadow.
  • The ruins form the backdrop, with vertical and horizontal lines framing the scene.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the fire as a focal point and the shelter balancing the right side.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of camaraderie and survival in a fantasy wilderness setting.
  • The warm firelight draws attention to the goblin’s activity, suggesting resourcefulness and comfort despite the ruined surroundings.
  • The contrast between the lively goblin and the resting human adds narrative depth, implying a moment of rest or camp life during a journey or adventure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.061,r=0.875,b=0.522), with ID b8fd7b8f-1f18-4bec-b26b-fabd1c89e80a -->

A group in exploration mode can attempt to rest,
but they aren’t entirely safe from danger, and their rest
might be interrupted. The 8 hours of rest do not need
to be consecutive, however, and after an interruption,
characters can go back to sleep. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.540,r=0.470,b=0.617), with ID c862a0fe-f6f3-4257-9765-0b9f8feff371 -->

Sleeping in armor results in poor rest and causes a
character to wake up fatigued. If a character would have
recovered from fatigue, sleeping in armor prevents it.
    If a character goes more than 16 hours without going
to sleep, they become fatigued. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.617,r=0.470,b=0.693), with ID 30dc0543-be42-43c7-9c07-8bf4bbb3e7b5 -->

Taking long-term rest for faster recovery is part of downtime and can't be done during exploration. See page 50 for these rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.693,r=0.470,b=0.741), with ID 378df6fa-471a-4f7c-820e-9c0c235b9474 -->

Watches and Surprise Attacks
Adventuring parties usually put a few people on guard to watch out for danger while the others rest. Spending time on watch also interrupts sleep, so a night’s schedule needs to account for everyone’s time on guard duty. The Watches and Rest table indicates how long the group needs to set aside for rest, assuming everyone gets a rotating watch assignment of equal length. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.750,r=0.470,b=0.877), with ID a432a02a-fa05-4e6f-8a9f-2daedc28287b -->

If a surprise encounter would occur during rest, you
can roll a die to randomly determine which character is
on watch at the time. All characters roll initiative; sleeping
characters typically roll Perception with a –4 status penalty <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.879,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 77ad7400-83b3-41b1-ad34-36c05f4d4ad2 -->

for being unconscious. They don’t automatically wake up
when rolling initiative, but they might roll a Perception
check to wake up at the start of their turn due to noise. If a
savvy enemy waits for a particularly vulnerable character to
take watch before attacking, the attack can happen on that
character’s watch automatically. However, you might have
the ambusher attempt a Stealth check against the Perception
DCs of all characters to see if anyone noticed its approach. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.541,r=0.860,b=0.664), with ID d1d20e10-d158-49fd-9054-ff61670b6b25 -->

# STARVATION AND THIRST
Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive comfortably. When they can’t, they’re fatigued until they do. After a number of days without water equal to a creature’s Constitution modifier + 1, the creature takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches its thirst. After the same amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day that can’t be healed until it eats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.797,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 9cfa7624-e9ba-40a9-b84d-90b5aa5607ab -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-themed illustration showing a tavern or inn scene, likely from a role-playing game context, with two main characters at a table and a bartender in the background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The setting is a cozy tavern or inn with wooden furniture and shelves lined with jars and teapots.
  • Two characters are seated at a round wooden table in the foreground: one in a flowing green and blue dress with gold jewelry, the other in sturdy adventurer’s attire with a sword at their side, pouring tea from a metal teapot into a glass cup on a saucer.
  • A bartender or innkeeper leans on the bar in the background, watching the scene with a thoughtful or dreamy expression.
  • The lighting is warm, with sunlight streaming in from a window on the right, casting a golden glow.
  • The color palette features earthy browns, greens, and blues, with accents of gold and red.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • Decorative blue and white pennants hang from the shelves, adding to the festive or welcoming atmosphere.
  • The image includes the “Pathfinder GM Core” branding in the upper left corner, indicating its association with the Pathfinder role-playing game.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two main characters are positioned at the center and right of the foreground, with the bartender in the midground, slightly elevated behind the bar.
  • The table and chairs are arranged to create a sense of intimacy and focus on the interaction between the two characters.
  • Shelves with jars and teapots recede into the background, adding depth to the scene.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a moment of camaraderie or conversation in a fantasy tavern, emphasizing the social and narrative aspects of role-playing games.
  • The warm lighting and detailed environment create an inviting and immersive atmosphere, suitable for a game master’s guide or similar publication. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.004,t=0.008,r=0.994,b=0.521), with ID 6b812e8d-3ce2-4688-ba6a-240169655891 -->

# RUNNING DOWNTIME

There’s more to life than fighting monsters and looting treasure. What happens when a PC wins a deed to a tavern in a game of cards, crafts a magical item, builds a home, or pursues a relationship? All these goals and more are resolved by running downtime. Downtime is the space between adventures, where your PCs take a step back before the next chapter starts. In downtime, you can sum up the important events of a whole day with just one roll. Use this mode when the characters return home or otherwise aren’t adventuring. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.132,t=0.536,r=0.913,b=0.683), with ID 23bb514b-ed6d-4616-927d-440cdfbf2099 -->

Usually, downtime is a few minutes at the start of a
session or a break between major chapters of an
adventure. On rare occasions, you might have a whole
session of downtime to play out a specific story. As
with exploration, you might punctuate downtime with
roleplaying or encounters when it’s natural to do so. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.707,r=0.515,b=0.801), with ID d44c2536-d4d2-4688-8b28-20a60f3995c6 -->

**Stakes:** None to low. Downtime is the counterpart to adventuring and covers low-risk activities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.801,r=0.514,b=0.831), with ID b921dacf-a89c-431b-83f9-afb91f96ae22 -->

**Time Scale:** Downtime can last days, weeks, months, or years in the game world in just a few minutes of real time at your game table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.832,r=0.513,b=0.878), with ID 99e3da7c-a143-48d6-9062-97fa9d041b5e -->

**Actions and Reactions:** If you need to use actions and reactions, switch to exploration or encounter mode. A creature that can’t act is unable to perform most downtime activities, but it can take long-term rest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.878,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID f80a191a-18b0-49f4-8e94-b435a9dafcd5 -->

## DEPTH OF DOWNTIME
Determine how involved your group wants downtime to be at the start of the game. If your players vary greatly in preference, you might need to find a middle ground, or some way to give the players least interested in downtime something they would find compelling. You can adjust downtime depth as the game goes along, and you might find it becomes more important to the players as their connection to the setting grows stronger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.705,r=0.906,b=0.847), with ID d127468e-f1b8-4bba-add4-32d618752af2 -->

Pay attention to the amount of real-world time you
spend in downtime and the level of detail. Downtime
should rarely last a whole session. Usually, a half hour
between significant adventures is about right, and 15
minutes for shorter lulls in the action, such as when PCs
return to a town briefly in the middle of an adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.847,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID 6b24e426-dacf-4ff8-ba95-1d48b5f7f0e8 -->

44 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.959,r=0.084,b=0.983), with ID bd100f75-2b1f-4ae1-9615-309398d49faf -->

RUNNING THE GAME <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.019,r=0.868,b=0.043), with ID 4f4fccf7-6edb-4261-ab65-6d344d439bb4 -->

You can extend this time as needed for more detailed
roleplaying scenes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.079,r=0.469,b=0.111), with ID dc510064-17b6-45f6-a002-cfd2b09296cc -->

For the level of detail, it’s important to give more than just an overview, but often the basics will do. “A fleet of merchant ships arrives in the port, and an officer puts you to work unloading cargo” might do for using Sailing Lore to Earn Income, and “Your shipment of iron arrives late, but you’re able to complete the armor” could be enough for Crafting. Go deeper if the player sets out to do something specific or asks questions you think have potential for an interesting story, but be careful with too much detail, as you run the risk of boring most of the table with minutiae. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.111,r=0.471,b=0.280), with ID 504ce60a-3101-4669-9d7f-45a0875b20ab -->

Group Engagement
One major challenge of downtime is keeping the whole group involved. When you can, combine multiple people’s tasks into one. For instance, if one PC wants to Earn Income with Performance and another wants to offer their services as a medic, you might say that a traveling caravan is stopping briefly, seeking entertainment and treatment for diseases and injuries their group suffered on the road. That means you can put both PCs in the same scene. You can also look for downtime activities that affect multiple characters’ interests. For instance, if the rogue’s contact at the thieves’ guild wants a special magical cloak, a different PC might Craft that cloak. This lets those PCs help each other more directly. If the barbarian’s player doesn’t plan to do anything in downtime, you might let the barbarian Aid another character in crafting weapons—feeding the forge and working the bellows, for instance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.291,r=0.471,b=0.555), with ID ec014730-649d-43d9-bd0b-053df852dbd9 -->

If a player really isn’t interested in downtime, they might not want to engage at all. In that case, it’s best to shorten the time you spend on downtime and give their actions a one-sentence description. If other players want a deeper downtime experience, consider extending game sessions or running side sessions for just those players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.556,r=0.470,b=0.649), with ID 5a861f03-db71-4b52-aeb0-5b57f0d8ac67 -->

Campaigns without Downtime  
There are two ways you might end up with a game that has no downtime: no time and no interest. In the first, the story moves along so quickly that the PCs don’t really have time to engage with downtime. Think of it like a breakneck action movie, where the characters barely have time to breathe before they’re on to the next challenge, and even the end of an adventure is a cliffhanger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.658,r=0.469,b=0.785), with ID fa21f0b8-57aa-4199-a9c7-40b6786b1acd -->

In the second, you and the other players just don’t care
about downtime at all. It doesn’t interest you. In this
case, just summarize what happens between adventures
and skip using any downtime rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.786,r=0.469,b=0.847), with ID 72135dce-0922-4ae8-ae81-2468be166098 -->

If you skip downtime, you might not need to adjust
your game. The money PCs can earn during downtime
is minor compared to what they can gain through
adventures. However, the PCs will have less choice in
what items they get if they don’t Craft or earn extra
money to buy items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.848,r=0.469,b=0.939), with ID d2e130ff-1e29-4201-881e-3ca440c8cdf3 -->

- • Demonstrate changes to the setting that result from the PCs’ previous achievements, giving them time to breathe and appreciate what they’ve accomplished.
- • Emphasize the PCs’ planning and the fruit it bears.
- • Avoid bogging the game down, even if a great deal of time passes. Keep the number of rolls small.
- • Bring back compelling NPCs or plot threads established in previous downtime or adventures.
- • Interject interesting events and scenes related to what the PCs do to make the world feel more alive.
- • Switch to encounter or exploration mode as needed when actions spur a new scene or adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.076,r=0.861,b=0.368), with ID 524d63f6-ab0a-4524-910b-2bd12ebaa543 -->

## Long-Term Goals
Downtime is more satisfying when the PCs work toward long-term goals rather than perform disconnected tasks. You can ask players what their PCs’ goals are, and also look for storylines they’re interested in that you can use as seeds for long-term goals. Long-term goals might include running a business, creating a guild, establishing an arcane academy, returning a despoiled land to its natural splendor, reforming local politics, or rebuilding a ruin. Goals involving organizations are a good opportunity to use the leadership subsystem on page 204. If players don’t have clear ideas for their goals, look at their backgrounds, NPCs they know, and things they’ve expressed interest in during adventures to develop some suggestions. Remember that you’re not trying to get them to accept your exact suggestions but to pick a goal they really like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.383,r=0.861,b=0.647), with ID 1a054f5f-96e6-4fee-8f9f-2c3dfa8cbfca -->

Long-term goals should shape the game, and reinforcing their progress is key. Show changes, good and bad, that result from the PCs’ efforts, both in downtime and on their adventures if applicable. This doesn’t have to be subtle! You can directly say, “You’ve been trying to get the magistrate to allow you to buy this plot of land, but the fact that you entered the wizard’s tower illegally seems to have soured him toward you.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.648,r=0.860,b=0.770), with ID 042ca796-491f-4230-b7ec-ca19f5da9ca2 -->

- Start with a simple stand to sell their wares.
- Show they’re drawing big crowds and need to expand.
- Build a storefront.
- Open to modest success.
- Get a small but loyal following.
- Hire employees to keep up with demand.
- Deal with supply issues or competition.
- Get enough interest in a nearby settlement that they might want to expand their business. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.772,r=0.861,b=0.938), with ID e635b01c-9d7d-45e5-9573-bfc205b10040 -->

And so on. You can deliver each of these details through
a little vignette. For example, if you use the second bullet
point, you might describe the throng of people crowded
around the PCs’ stand and say they sold out of goods
before half the people were served. Downtime goals are
a great way to weave the PCs’ agency into the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.078,r=0.516,b=0.175), with ID da688afb-1a17-41e7-b1c0-025ab3d1565b -->

Success and Failure  
Success at a reasonable long-term goal should be likely, but not guaranteed. Give the player an expectation of how likely their goal is to work out based on how ambitious it is. Be clear about how much downtime it will take compared to the amount of downtime you expect the party will get during your campaign. Then, let the player decide how to commit their downtime and to which tasks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.184,r=0.515,b=0.325), with ID c923ac13-06ce-4cfc-af4a-86c1b39d78d7 -->

Repeated failures or outside problems could lead
to the whole goal failing. It happens! But give the
player a fair chance. Even if their goal is really hard
to achieve—like driving the undead out of Ustalav—
they might find a way. Don’t undermine their efforts
or ideas, but do make clear the magnitude of the task
they’ve chosen. Remember that even if a goal fails, the
effort was worthwhile, and the PCs might still achieve
smaller successes along the way that open up new goals.
For instance, the PCs might not succeed at driving the
undead out of Ustalav, but in the process, they might
discover part of a powerful holy spell that might be able
to, if it can somehow be reassembled. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.327,r=0.514,b=0.525), with ID 1f042d3b-7ac6-4083-90f4-cdaae31596de -->

A failure or a success at a long-term goal can be a
major emotional beat for the character. They’ve changed
the world, after all! Don’t shortchange it just because it
happened in downtime. In fact, because it might have
taken place over multiple sessions, the player might have
been looking forward to the results for a really long time! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.526,r=0.513,b=0.618), with ID 77e0dcf3-781d-4627-98b1-0e10375c0372 -->

Playing out a Downtime Day  
At the start of a given day of downtime, have all the players declare what their characters are trying to accomplish that day. You can then resolve one character’s efforts at a time (or group some characters together, if they’re cooperating on a single project). Some activities, such as Earning Income, require only a simple roll and some embellishment from you and the player. Other activities are more involved, incorporating encounters or exploration. You can call on the players to play out their downtime activities in any order, though it’s often best to do the simplest ones first. Players who aren’t part of a more involved activity might have time to take a break from the table while the more complex activities are played out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.628,r=0.513,b=0.862), with ID d08adce4-7459-47b0-b149-0b75e20afad2 -->

Characters can undertake their daily preparations if
they want, just as they would on a day of exploration.
Ask players to establish a standard set of preparations,
and you can assume the characters go through the same
routine every day unless their players say otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.863,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 71e76b51-ac42-4a99-9125-5020ffc70052 -->

Cooperation
Multiple characters can cooperate on the same downtime task. If it’s a simple task that requires just one check, such as a party Subsisting as they await rescue on a desert island, one character rolls the necessary check while everyone else Aids that character. If it’s a complex task, assume all of them are working on different parts of it at one time, so all their efforts count toward its completion. For example, a party might collaborate to build a theater, with one character drawing up architectural plans, one doing manual labor, and one talking to local politicians and guilds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.251), with ID 5fa60394-72c6-4527-8b17-9ab8e0c24ac3 -->

Checks  
Some downtime activities require rolls, typically skill checks. Because these rolls represent the culmination of a series of tasks over a long period, players can’t use most abilities or spells that manipulate die rolls, such as activating a magic item to gain a bonus or casting a fortune spell to roll twice. Constant benefits still apply, though, so someone might invest a magic item that gives them a bonus without requiring activation. You might make specific exceptions to this rule. If something could apply constantly, or so often that it might as well be constant, it’s more likely to be used for downtime checks; for instance, Assurance could apply. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.261,r=0.905,b=0.465), with ID bf47b1d3-6e32-4b4a-8f0e-1bc5c682aac5 -->

# LONGER PERIODS OF DOWNTIME
Running downtime during a long time off—like several
weeks, months, or even years—can be more challenging.
However, it’s also an opportunity for the characters to
progress toward long-term plans rather than worrying
about day-to-day activities. Because so much time is
involved, characters don’t roll a check for each day.
Instead, they deal with a few special events, average out
the rest of the downtime, and expend any resources,
such as their general cost of living. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.475,r=0.905,b=0.648), with ID 2fb77ddd-44f1-450c-a1de-b27aa900d849 -->

## Events
After the characters state what they want to achieve in their downtime, select a few standout events for each of them—usually one event for a period of a week or a month, or four events for a year or longer. These events should be tailored to each character and their goals, and they can serve as hooks for adventures or plot development. A character using Perform to Earn Income could produce a commanding performance of a new play for visiting nobility (who end up so impressed that they give the party their next quest). Someone using Crafting might get a lucrative commission to craft a special item (that must be recovered from a renowned master thief in the next session). A character with Lore might have to research a difficult problem (uncovering signs of an impending cataclysm that will need the PCs to act in order to avert it). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.660,r=0.904,b=0.906), with ID ccd857ae-e6e5-4871-b6b2-70bdaf3f4cd4 -->

downtime events; you just choose the relevant skill and
DC. For example, if a character intends to build their
own library to house their books on magic, you might
decide setting the foundation and organizing the library
once construction is finished are major events. The first
could be a Crafting check, and the second an Arcana or
Library Lore check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.078,r=0.471,b=0.189), with ID bac2534e-6312-40bb-84ac-282ff46facec -->

Average Progress  
For long periods of downtime, you might not want to roll for every week, or even every month. Instead, set the level for one task using the lowest level the character can reliably find in the place where they spend their downtime (see Difficulty Classes on page 52 for more on setting task levels). If the character fails this check, you might allow them to try again after a week (or a month, if you’re dealing with years of downtime). Don’t allow them to roll again if they succeeded but want to try for a critical success, unless they do something in the story of the game that you think makes it reasonable to allow a new roll. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.199,r=0.471,b=0.386), with ID b9f0c2c2-fb14-4b4c-b43d-76cdfbd6864f -->

The events you include during a long stretch of downtime should typically feature higher-level tasks than the baseline. For instance, a character Earning Income with Sailing Lore for 4 months might work at a port doing 1st-level tasks most of the time, but have 1 week of 3rd-level tasks to account for busy periods. You’ll normally have the player roll once for the time they spent at 1st-level tasks and once for the week of 3rd-level tasks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.388,r=0.470,b=0.510), with ID 7958a0ca-167a-4ec7-93b5-56155e76af1d -->

# TASKS AND EVENTS
Players will often look to you for tasks they might take on during downtime, especially if they’re looking to Earn Income. You should also interject special events to surprise your players and add interesting scenes. If you need some quick ideas for tasks characters might offer a PC, look at the tables below for inspiration. The Earn Income tasks are arranged with tasks appropriate for low-level PCs first, but most can be adapted to the level you need. For the events, you might need to “zoom in” to focus on a special scene or even a short encounter or adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.521,r=0.470,b=0.693), with ID 391fb777-0d5a-4b2e-b948-3e74739591f2 -->

## BUYING AND SELLING ITEMS
After an adventure yields a windfall, the characters
might have a number of items they want to sell.
Likewise, when they’re flush with currency, they might
want to stock up on gear. It usually takes 1 day of
downtime to sell off a few goods or shop around to
buy a couple items. It can take longer to sell off a large
number of goods, expensive items, or items that aren’t
in high demand. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.200,r=0.905,b=0.340), with ID e509a397-5d56-47f2-991a-8751bd39d799 -->

An item can usually be purchased at its full Price and
sold for half its Price. Supply and demand can affect
these numbers, but only occasionally. However, the game
leaves it up to you to determine what items the PCs can
and can’t purchase and the final market Price for them.
Settlements the size of a town or bigger typically have
at least one vendor for basic, common gear, and even
magic and alchemical items of 1st level. Beyond that, it all
depends on how much you want to allow the players
to determine their abilities and how much verisimilitude
you want in your game. You can set the specifics where
you need, but let’s look at three possibilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.342,r=0.904,b=0.524), with ID 2fd66b10-b2cb-45b5-96af-795fb11a85bb -->

PCs can buy what they want where they want. You
gloss over the details of markets. PCs can sell whatever
they want for half the Price and buy any item to which
they have access at full Price. This approach is focused
on expediency over verisimilitude and is likely to reduce
the number of unusual or distinctive items the PCs have,
as many players seek out the ones that most directly
support their characters’ strengths. This still means
there’s a limit on purchasing uncommon or rarer items,
but you could even do away with rarity if your group
wants, or add a surcharge instead (depending on your
group’s play style, that could be anywhere from 10% to
100% for uncommon items, and 25% to 500% if you
also want to open up all rare items). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.526,r=0.903,b=0.738), with ID 99fa3e3d-c45a-4965-ba6d-c5391c12af51 -->

**PCs can buy what they want but must put in additional
effort.** If they want to sell or buy items, PCs must be in a
location where the markets can support that. They can
usually sell a single item for half its Price, but the Price
for something already plentiful on the market could
drop lower, typically to 25% or 10%, or be refused
entirely if there’s a glut. Buying an item usually costs the
full Price; buying higher-level items (or uncommon items
if they’re available at all) requires seeking out a special
vendor or NPC and can take extra time, representing a
real investment by the PCs. They might be unable to find
the item at all even after their time investment, based
on the settlement’s parameters. This approach allows PCs <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.741,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 99e68c4f-0838-4c6b-9f52-e1be33e606c4 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting a lively tavern scene with a central performer on a table, surrounded by an audience in a rustic, candle-lit environment.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a performer in elaborate red and black attire, standing on a table with arms raised, as if singing or casting a spell.
  • The setting is a medieval-style tavern with stone walls, wooden beams, and warm, low lighting from candles and a wall torch.
  • The audience consists of several people seated at tables, some raising mugs or gesturing toward the performer, and a musician playing a flute on a barrel in the background.
  • Confetti or magical sparkles are suspended in the air near the performer, suggesting a festive or magical atmosphere.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm browns, oranges, and reds, enhancing the cozy, lively mood.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible textures on wood, fabric, and stone.
  • Lighting sources include candles on tables and a wall torch, casting soft, directional shadows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The performer is centrally placed on a table in the foreground, elevated above the audience.
  • Audience members are arranged around the table, facing the performer, with some reaching out or holding drinks.
  • The musician is positioned to the right, slightly behind the performer, adding depth to the scene.
  • Background elements include shelves with bottles and plates, a barrel, and a serving woman.

Analysis :
  • The composition draws attention to the performer as the focal point, with audience reactions emphasizing engagement and entertainment.
  • The use of warm lighting and close arrangement of figures creates an intimate, energetic atmosphere typical of a fantasy tavern gathering.
  • The presence of confetti or magical effects suggests a performance that is either celebratory or supernatural in nature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.061,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 917c14a5-5761-4e80-b84a-300f302b96ad -->

to determine some of their items, but it forces them to
really work to get more powerful items and discourages
looting every enemy to sell off fairly ordinary armor.
This can be the most work for you but can make the
world feel diverse and complex. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.540,r=0.471,b=0.617), with ID b944cc25-0a5b-4e65-aa4b-39ccb876cc6a -->

**Magical markets are rare or nonexistent.** PCs get what they find in adventures and can Craft their own items, if you allow them to get formulas in some way. If you have magical marketplaces at all, their selections are small. They sell items at full Price and have difficulty attaining the funds to buy more items. They might purchase items for half of the Price but are far more selective about what they take. If you use this approach, PCs are far more likely to use strange items they find but might be dissatisfied or even underpowered depending on what items you give them. Even in this style of game, you might want to allow them to get weapons and armor with fundamental runes fairly easily or make sure you award those on a regular basis. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.618,r=0.470,b=0.832), with ID e333f42c-deb3-44d8-89f7-7252c156f061 -->

## MONEY IN DOWNTIME
While the amount of money the PCs can earn during short periods of downtime is significantly less than the value of the loot they gain while adventuring, it can still serve as a satisfying bonus. The PCs might use their money to outfit themselves better, donate it <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.842,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID a5a808e5-b826-4ecb-b472-822089a7e280 -->

toward a good cause, or pool it together to save for a
major purchase. If you find that a PC tends to forget
about their money or save it up more cautiously than
they really need to, offer them rewarding opportunities
to spend it. For instance, they might be approached to
contribute to a charity in desperate need or sponsor an
artist looking for a patron. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.541,r=0.861,b=0.648), with ID ded3f9f2-1626-46ae-a855-8b45b8bde3f2 -->

**Investments**  
The downtime system isn’t meant to deal with investing money, receiving interest, or the like just to make more money. Rather, investing should result in changes in the world. PCs might invest in founding a museum and find on their return that the collection has grown. If they fund an expedition, they might get access to interesting trade goods later on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.660,r=0.861,b=0.785), with ID 65bdb4e9-002b-490c-b88b-61121b8712d7 -->

When characters are investing in a major endeavor, the amount of in-world time invested often matters more than the money. While spending additional money greatly increases the efficiency of Crafting an item, you can't build a fort in a day just because you have enough money to pay for the whole process. Downtime is a good opportunity for characters to start long processes that can continue in the background as the PCs adventure, provided they can find a trustworthy, competent person to run things in their stead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.787,r=0.859,b=0.938), with ID 98558132-ffa1-4e87-a52a-1a7ccb88c2ea -->

Money during Long Periods of Downtime  
If the PCs have a very long time between adventures, especially years, they have the opportunity to collect a great deal of money through downtime. Use the guidelines for average progress (page 247) and cost of living on page 295 of Player Core to figure out how much they get. Because you’re trying to convey that a long time has passed, have them spend it before you jump to the end of downtime. What did they invest in during those years? What drew their interest? Did their fortunes rise or fall? Did they acquire interesting objects or hire compelling people? Consider this expenditure another way to show how the PCs impact the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.282), with ID 0b54e1c3-1e59-44a3-afb4-a76cebde763e -->

## Cost of Living
Tracking cost of living is usually best reserved for months or years of downtime since that’s when someone might earn a substantial amount of money from downtime activities and find that costs really add up. You can usually ignore it if there are only a few days of downtime, though if a PC is roleplaying a fine or extravagant lifestyle, you might charge them during even short periods of downtime to reinforce the story they’re telling. For short periods of downtime, characters are usually just passing through a settlement or spending a bit of time there. They can use the prices for inn stays and meals found on page 294 of _Player Core_. For long stretches of downtime, use the values on the Cost of Living table, repeated below for convenience. Deduct these costs from a character’s funds after they gain any money from their other downtime activities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.291,r=0.515,b=0.555), with ID ad54092b-dbbf-46fe-980d-f98431b2979f -->

A character can live off the land instead, but each day
they do, they typically use the Subsist activity (*Player Core*
232) to the exclusion of any other downtime activity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.556,r=0.514,b=0.603), with ID d4409321-a033-4d97-8bea-182ccd8cc4e3 -->

Long-Term Rest
Each full 24-hour period a character spends resting during downtime allows them to recover double what they would for an 8-hour rest. They must spend this time resting in a comfortable and secure location, typically in bed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.736,r=0.513,b=0.815), with ID 5912df80-9514-4c93-989c-ddcad384efe9 -->

If they spend significantly longer in bed rest—usually
from a few days to a week of downtime—they recover
from all damage and most nonpermanent conditions.
Characters affected by diseases, long-lasting poisons,
or similar afflictions might need to continue attempting
saves during downtime. Some curses, permanent injuries,
and other situations that require magic or special care to
remove don’t end automatically during long-term rest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.817,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 3955e442-d9ef-42c2-8d9f-2844acf0682f -->

## RETRAINING
The retraining rules on page 440 of the _Player Core_ allow a player to change some character choices, but they rely on you, as the GM, to decide whether the retraining requires a teacher, how long it takes, if it has any associated costs, and if the ability can be retrained at all. It’s reasonable for a character to retrain most choices, and you should allow them. Only choices that are truly intrinsic to the character, like a sorcerer’s bloodline, should be off limits without extraordinary circumstances. Consider what effort each PC puts forth as they retrain, so you can describe how they feel their abilities change. What kind of research and practice do they do? If they have a teacher, what advice does that teacher give? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.077,r=0.904,b=0.294), with ID 4eea6f8d-52c0-42a2-a95f-6ab6322694c8 -->

You can run a campaign without retraining if you
want the PCs to be more bound by their decisions or
are running a game without downtime. However, if your
campaign doesn’t use downtime rules but a player really
regrets a decision made while building or leveling up
their character, you might make an exception for them,
either by letting them simply change the decision or by
finding a rare in-story element to justify the decision,
such as a rare potion or a magical nexus that alters time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.297,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID b673c09c-e0d8-4070-a739-92a0dc18261e -->

Try to make retraining into a story. Use NPCs the
character already knows as teachers, have a character
undertake intense research in a mysterious old library, or
ground the retraining in the game's narrative by making
it the consequence of something that happened to the
character in a previous session. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.434,r=0.904,b=0.525), with ID d40f0aa8-3e90-4f5b-9df7-8f89516bf7da -->

Time
Retraining a feat or skill increase typically takes a week. Class features that require a choice can also be retrained but take longer: at least a month, possibly more. Retraining might take even longer if it would be especially physically demanding or require travel, lengthy experimentation, or in-depth research, but usually, you won’t want to require more than a month for a feat or skill, or 4 months for a class feature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.537,r=0.903,b=0.677), with ID 76c97c00-920b-4a62-86d3-8276a0b4fed3 -->

A character might need to retrain several options
at once. For instance, retraining a skill increase might
mean they have skill feats they can no longer use, and so
they’ll need to retrain those as well. You can add all this
retraining time together, then reduce the total a bit to
represent the cohesive nature of the retraining. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.679,r=0.903,b=0.770), with ID 7dd6b712-3cb5-482a-a25d-11a9ff8c002a -->

Instruction and Costs
The rules abstract the process of learning new things as you level up—you're learning on the job—but retraining suggests that the character works with a teacher or undergoes specific practice to retrain. If you want, you can entirely ignore this aspect of retraining, but it does give an opportunity to introduce (or reintroduce) NPCs and further the game's story. You can even have one player character mentor another, particularly when it comes to retraining skills. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.783,r=0.904,b=0.938), with ID ed75beaf-1309-4bc5-9c2d-a10cae82a3d7 -->

You don’t have to use teachers, but it gives you a great
way to introduce a new NPC or bring back an existing
one in a new role. The role of a teacher could also be
filled by communing with nature for a druid, poring
through a massive grimoire for a wizard, and so on. The
important part is the guidance gained from that source.

Any costs to retraining should be pretty minor—about
as much as a PC could gain by Earning Income over the
same period of time. The costs are mostly there to make the
training feel appropriate within the context of the story, not
to consume significant amounts of the character’s earnings.
A teacher might volunteer to work without pay as
a reward for something the character has already
done or simply ask for a favor in return. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.585,r=0.470,b=0.711), with ID f5c70563-fa08-4199-8c01-321343abe578 -->

Extreme Retraining  
By the default rules, PCs can’t retrain their class, ancestry, background, attribute modifiers, or anything else intrinsic to their character. However, you might be able to find a way to make this happen in the story, going beyond the realm of retraining and into deeper, story-based quests. Class and attribute modifiers are the simplest of these changes to justify, as they could come about solely through intense retraining. Especially at low levels, you might let a player rebuild their character as a different class, perhaps starting by retraining into a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.719,r=0.461,b=0.942), with ID 1a87c01d-c8d2-4fa5-9c47-8583a60013d0 -->

multiclass dedication for their new class and swapping into
more feats from that dedication as partial progress toward
the class change. Just be mindful that they aren’t swapping
over to switch out a class they think is great at low levels
for one they think is stronger at high levels. Retraining a
class or ability modifiers should take a long time, typically
months or years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.079,r=0.861,b=0.188), with ID efe25b8a-d28a-46a8-8c7d-dc5b468aee51 -->

Changing an ancestry or heritage requires some kind
of magic, such as reincarnation into a new form. This
might take a complex ritual, exposure to bizarre and rare
magic, or the intervention of a deity. For instance, you
might require an elf who wants to be a halfling to first
become trained in Halfling Lore, worship the halfling
pantheon, and eventually do a great service for halflings
to get a divine blessing of transformation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.189,r=0.861,b=0.310), with ID 63dc896b-b1bb-4162-881f-ec5cbd5c2ab6 -->

Retraining a background requires altering the game’s
story so that the events the PC thought happened didn’t.
That can be pretty tricky to justify! One easy scenario
is that they had their memory altered and need to get it
magically restored to reveal their “true” background—the
new retrained background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.311,r=0.861,b=0.402), with ID 4226f3dc-d963-4f5d-a3ff-79c28d95209c -->

Of course, in all these cases you could make an
exception and just let the player make the change without
explanation. This effectively acknowledges that you’re
playing a game and don’t need an in-world justification
to make certain retroactive changes. For some groups,
it might be easier, or require less suspension of disbelief,
to ask the group to adjust their ideas of what previously
happened in the game—retconning events—than to create
an in-world justification for something like an elf turning
into a halfling via magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.403,r=0.862,b=0.556), with ID e7a2b1ab-02de-40fe-934c-9207e4edaa6d -->

# DIFFICULTY CLASSES

*As the Game Master, it’s up to you to set the difficulty classes (DCs) for checks that don’t use a predefined DC. The following sections offer advice on how to set appropriate DCs and tweak them as needed to feel natural for your story. Picking a simple DC and using a level-based DC each work well in certain circumstances, and you can adjust both types of DC using the advice on adjusting difficulty.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.076,r=0.911,b=0.201), with ID 9d0328ba-f0bc-4849-923d-54a585914dba -->

Simple DCs
Sometimes you need to quickly set a difficulty class. The easiest method is to select a simple DC from the Simple DCs table on page 53 by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task). If it’s something pretty much anyone would have a decent chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information, so you’d set the DC at 30—the simple master DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.228,r=0.516,b=0.478), with ID 1c59eb3a-563f-4342-88ca-818721dcd9c8 -->

Simple DCs work well when you need a DC on the
fly and there’s no level associated with the task. They’re
most useful for skill checks. Because there isn’t much
gradation between the simple DCs, they don’t work as
well for hazards or combats where the PCs’ lives are
on the line; you’re better off using level-based DCs for
such challenges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.479,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID 717ce0ff-2a27-4277-b087-f2b0275f394b -->

LEVEL-BASED DCs  
When you’re determining a skill DC based on something that has a level, use the table below to set the DC. Find the level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since spells use a 1–10 scale, use the Spell Rank column for them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.597,r=0.514,b=0.693), with ID da2fdcb1-e2bb-4d61-a3fe-1e4fe818c348 -->

Use these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You could simply say only someone with master proficiency could climb it and use the simple DC of 30. Or you might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the dungeon crafted the wall and use the 15th-level DC of 34. Either approach is reasonable! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.694,r=0.514,b=0.877), with ID b6eed94d-1f40-4efc-8355-5095efa7ba28 -->

Note that PCs who invest in a skill become more
likely to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase
in level, and the listed DCs eventually pose very little
challenge for them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.878,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID bc7344cd-d138-4112-b490-df8a6e4e968f -->

ADJUSTING DIFFICULTY  
You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline, whether to account for PCs’ areas of expertise or to represent the rarity of spells or items. A DC adjustment represents an essential difference in the difficulty of a task and applies to anyone attempting a specific check for it. Adjustments happen most often with tasks whose DCs are based on their level. You’ll often apply the adjustments for uncommon, rare, or unique subjects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.231,r=0.906,b=0.371), with ID 1f6a58f6-f692-4787-ab0e-0309baa6e923 -->

The DC Adjustments table lists the categories of adjustments. The adjustments’ names are relative to the base difficulty of the task itself—a very hard 2nd-level task will not be “very hard” for a 10th-level PC to accomplish! PCs who invest in a skill will become better and better at that skill as they increase in level. For example, even the best 1st-level PC has grim odds against an incredibly hard 1st-level DC, with a huge chance of critical failure, but by 20th level, an optimized character with a modicum of magic or assistance can take down incredibly hard 20th-level DCs over half the time, critically failing only on a 1. At higher levels, many groups will find that the very hard DC is more like standard for them; keep that in mind if you need a check that presents a true challenge to a high-level group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.373,r=0.904,b=0.600), with ID c9e8c3b4-7b77-456c-ae1d-2dd7aa21f5a0 -->

You might use different DCs for a task based on the
particular skill or statistic used for the check. Let’s say
your PCs encounter a magical tome about dragons. The
tome is 4th-level and has the arcane trait, so you set the
DC of an Arcana check to Identify the Magic to 19. As
noted in Identify Magic, other magic-related skills can
typically be used at a higher DC, so you might decide
the check is very hard for a character using Occultism
instead and set the DC at 24 for characters using that
skill. If a character in your group had Dragon Lore, you
might determine that it would be easy or very easy for
them to use that skill and adjust the DC to 17 or 14.
These adjustments aren’t taking the place of characters’
bonuses, modifiers, and penalties—they are due to the
applicability of the skills being used. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.603,r=0.904,b=0.832), with ID 6062a38d-5e1e-4735-bf8f-cd9ed19938c0 -->

Group Attempts  
The DCs in this chapter give an individual character a strong and increasing chance of success if they have some proficiency. On occasion, though, you'll have a task that only one person in the group needs to succeed at, but that everyone can attempt.
