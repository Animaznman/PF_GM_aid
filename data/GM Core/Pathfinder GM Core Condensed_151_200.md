OLD CHELIAX <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.336,t=0.535,r=0.619,b=0.576), with ID fa0e3f52-d598-4d84-92f3-488ead3203fd -->

At its height, the empire of **Cheliax** had holdings that
reached south from **Varisia** to **Garund** and east all the way
to **Galt**. Aroden was prophesized to return to the world of
mortals to usher in a new Age of Glory, and those prophecies
predicted the Chelaxian city of **Westcrown** would be the
point of his arrival. Instead, his death ignited a civil war
that lasted for decades. When the **Thrice-Damned House
of Thrune** emerged as victor, Cheliax had forever changed.
Under House Thrune’s rule, Cheliax now viewed Hell as a
blueprint for the state. The church of **Asmodeus** became
Cheliax’s official religion, and diabolism its most powerful
philosophy. The devil had come home to rule, and while the
nation’s politicians claimed that they maintained control
of their fate—that House Thrune had merely allied with
Hell to maintain its power and keep order—the nation’s
internal and external enemies know better. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.599,r=0.472,b=0.848), with ID 1f99a9ec-5486-4ce9-8e6b-6cb010b0704e -->

Many of Cheliax’s outlying provinces—such as  
**Andoran, Galt,** and **Sargava**—revolted and became their  
own nations. The nation of **Isger** remains, at least on paper,  
a thrall. Cheliax values Isger for its important position  
as a trade route to **Lake Encarthan**, but when Isger was  
wracked by the **Goblinblood Wars** several decades ago, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.847,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 05a70eb7-2264-4800-98e8-fbb6f4c672b4 -->

House Thrune did little to provide aid. As the repercussions  
of the **Whispering Tyrant**’s return to power send ripples of  
nervous dread through the land, Isger’s people grow fearful  
that they lack not only their own political strength, but also  
that of their supposed protector, and as a result, Isger is one  
of the lands in the Inner Sea region most in need of heroes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.602,r=0.861,b=0.693), with ID 911984ac-588a-46c5-8797-efd39c6db737 -->

Recently, several uprisings within Cheliax have further
tested the nation’s resolve. An Iomedaean rebellion called
the **Glorious Reclamation**, bolstered by their recovery of
a holy artifact, threatened Cheliax from within. House
Thrun and the Asmodean church defeated the Glorious
Reclamation, but at a price—a simultaneous rebellion was
successful, with a group of rebels called the **Silver Ravens**
negotiating the secession of the new nation of **Ravounel**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.694,r=0.861,b=0.816), with ID 526d15d4-e0e4-443e-b297-421725996bdf -->

North of Cheliax, the shadowy nation of Nidal remains
the diabolic nation’s only real ally. A theocracy ruled by
the church of Zon-Kuthon, Nidal is the oldest nation on
Avistan, for its people turned to the Midnight Lord for
protection during the Age of Darkness after Earthfall.
Today, pain and dread are comforts to the citizens of Nidal,
and millennia of rule under a church that revels in pain
have left them inured to agony and welcoming of loss. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.817,r=0.861,b=0.939), with ID 1c48a571-3d1a-4491-a1ba-685913bf68d3 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a monumental ruined gateway flanked by two colossal statues, set in a mountainous landscape at sunset, with architectural and environmental details suggesting an ancient, abandoned city.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a pair of massive humanoid statues holding shields and staves, integrated into the remains of a stone gateway or fortress.
  • The setting is a dramatic, rocky mountain pass with warm sunlight casting long shadows and highlighting the stonework in orange and purple hues.
  • The perspective is from a low angle, looking up at the statues and the ruined structures, with a body of water and scattered rocks in the foreground.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm oranges, pinks, and purples, evoking a sunset or sunrise.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurement, but the statues are many times larger than the human figures visible near their bases.
  • No on-image text except for the "Pathfinder GM Core" branding in the upper left.
  • The illustration includes fantasy architectural elements such as arches, towers, and domes, with weathered and broken features.

Spatial Relationships :

  • The lighting and color choices enhance the mood of awe and melancholy, while the scale contrast between the statues and human figures emphasizes the epic scope of the location.
  • The presence of ruins and weathering implies abandonment and the passage of time. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.003,r=0.996,b=0.521), with ID 89293ed4-34ab-4ee1-9d28-8e2227bafeb6 -->

SAGA LANDS <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.538,r=0.657,b=0.577), with ID 2c5a83dd-2072-4203-aea1-58fbcf5e9957 -->

While the opportunity for epic adventure exists throughout the world, in recent years, it seems the Saga Lands have produced the most notorious and legendary tales. These sprawling northern reaches feature kingdoms ruled by vikings and witches, realms home to mammoth-riding Kellid clans, and a frontier land of free cities and dangerous wilderness—all of which are steeped in the ancient legacy of the long-gone empire of Thassilon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.601,r=0.515,b=0.724), with ID cc2b8659-88c6-4a9a-8b85-971d131d6d4d -->

Millennia ago, the nation of Thassilon was ruled by the sinful, tyrannical **runelords**. These wizards carved out legends intended to last for an eternity, but even the mighty runelords succumbed to the devastation of Earthfall. The seven reigning runelords of that time retreated into the safety of extradimensional domains, and for eons they slumbered, until they began to wake in 4707 ar. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.724,r=0.514,b=0.832), with ID 457d30ff-6396-4e96-9850-6e2655873337 -->

The frontier realm of *Varisia*, once the heart of Thassilon, bore the brunt of the wrath of the first wakened runelord, an avaricious sadist named *Karzoug*. A band of unlikely heroes emerged from the small coastal town of Sandpoint to eventually face and defeat Karzoug, yet his wakening soon roused other slumbering runelords, and a new band of heroes was forced to defeat the risen tyrants. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.832,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 2d9d38f4-c338-48d9-80c3-9e93b087a842 -->

While the neighboring **Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Realms of the Mammoth Lords**, and witch-haunted **Irrisen** never faced direct repercussions from the runelords, these northern lands hold dangers of their own. A long-running cold war between the vikings of the Linnorm Kingdoms and the winter witches of Irrisen to the east finally came to a sputtering end when a daughter of the immortal witch **Baba Yaga** attempted to defy her mother and usurp Irrisen’s traditions of rule. While the eternal winter of Irrisen set in place by Baba Yaga endures, its new ruler, **Anastasia**, might prove to be the first benevolent presence to sit on the throne in centuries. Farther to the east, the **Kellid clans** of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords played their own pivotal roles in defying the demons of the **Worldwound**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.602,r=0.905,b=0.816), with ID 0a5e8542-fef7-4b7d-9f5d-4c6ce9b7a29b -->

Recently, a new nation has risen in the Saga Lands. After the runelords were defeated, two surviving runelords decided to adjust their traditions to fit this strange new world they found themselves in. Now the fledgling nation of **New Thassilon** sprawls along the northern border of Varisia, and it remains to be seen if its rulers will fully adopt a more peaceful path or if it’s but a matter of time before the old traditions of sin and violence rise once again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.816,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 56d50554-526c-422b-8997-142213c9ce66 -->

The empire of **Taldor** was historically the heart of the Shining Kingdoms. In the early Age of Enthronement, Taldor sent several **Armies of Exploration** to colonize the surrounding lands. Today, Taldor is but a shadow of its former glory, but after a recent bout of internal strife, a progressive new empress has claimed the crown, and Taldor might finally be on the path to recovering its old prestige. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.599,r=0.473,b=0.709), with ID d7cb942f-5dcb-4750-bf88-29e4c672437d -->

To the west, the democratic nation of **Andoran** stands
as a rising star on the international stage. Ever since the
province seceded from the nation of **Cheliax**, Andoran’s
military has helped restrict the power of their former rulers,
and its heroes have stood tall against all manner of peril to
the common folk. But with Cheliax’s recent upsets, rumors
flow that **House Thrune** might seek to reclaim its wayward
thrall. Given the looming threat of the **Whispering Tyrant**,
an all-out war between the two nations could be disastrous. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.709,r=0.472,b=0.847), with ID 3a0e11a9-0ed3-4124-b404-113901c17e15 -->

Northeast of Andoran sprawls the dwarven city-states of the **Five Kings Mountains**. No strangers to war, both against enemies and among themselves, the dwarves of the Five Kings remain allies of Andoran but have their own troubles that command most of their attention. To the west, the rich and powerful nation of **Druma** controls nearly half <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.846,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 19417bde-6234-4812-885c-4377398d7668 -->

of Lake Encarthan’s southern shoreline. From there, it uses its position to bolster its coffers and further the **Prophecies of Kalistrade**, a philosophy that teaches that wealth can be achieved through adherence to strict practices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.602,r=0.862,b=0.663), with ID aece0b7e-eb22-4dbf-845e-92f3432b0ee8 -->

Northeast of Druma lie the forested elven lands of **Kyonin**, one of Avistan’s oldest nations. This land belonged to elves long before Earthfall, but for thousands of years after that devastation, they left their realm abandoned. In that time, a powerful demon named **Treerazer** seized control of the forest’s southern reaches, corrupting the terrain into a desolate mire called the **Tanglebriar**. Although the original elven inhabitants have returned, they’ve been unable to force Treerazer from their southern border. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.663,r=0.862,b=0.801), with ID 68a3a387-18fb-4fea-856b-bc9010148bb3 -->

Farther east is the nation of Galt. Wracked for decades by
a self-perpetuating series of rebellions and revolutions, this
land has been torn apart over and over. Its people are weary
as they continue to live in the shadow of the final blades—
powerful magical guillotines that claim the souls of those
they decapitate. Stories are beginning to trickle that a bloody
gala took the lives of many Galtan dignitaries and shattered
the ranks of the Gray Gardeners who control the guillotines.
If true, change might be coming to this tumultuous nation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.801,r=0.862,b=0.940), with ID a0db35c3-de61-4c7f-9ba1-bdf5ce2ace68 -->

# Human Ethnicities
A variety of ethnic groups make up the human populace of the Inner Sea region. Many of these groups have origins on distant lands, but the Inner Sea region has a diverse population drawn from across the globe. Human characters can be from any of these ethnicities, regardless of what land they call home.

Characters from these ethnicities speak Common—also known as Taldane—if they come from the Inner Sea region, and some ethnicities give access to a regional language or another uncommon language (*Player Core* 89). Half-elves and half-orcs arise across all human ethnicities and bear the features of both those ethnicities and their non-human parents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.397,t=0.198,r=0.907,b=0.358), with ID 81af7afc-4a95-4e70-ae1a-b064356ded6c -->

Garundi

**Elves**
Golarion is not the original elven home world, but those elves who dwell here today are considered native to the planet. These people first came to Golarion from the neighboring planet of Castrovel via a network of portals known as aiudara.

Gnomes
The first gnomes arrived on Golarion at some point after Earthfall from the otherworldly dimension known as the First World, either fleeing a great danger or banished for a crime whose nature few can recall.

They tend to live playful and creative lives, bonding closely with allies in a short amount of time. While goblins are found most anywhere in the Inner Sea and adapt based on their environment, goblins tend to share certain cultural aspects. Namely, a penchant for songs, a sometimes-dangerous appreciation for fire, and fear of dogs and horses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.397,t=0.336,r=0.906,b=0.451), with ID 497bd297-a7eb-4fd3-b26e-cefbe65c0a2c -->

Many halflings have lived in the shadow of other societies for as long as they can remember, blending in with neighboring cultures and adding their own unique variations over time or as necessity demands. However, numerous distinct halfling cultures exist outside of the context of other peoples and nations, such as the Jaric, Mihrini, Othoban, and Uhlam halflings who formed their own traditions without the influence of humans and other creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.397,t=0.459,r=0.906,b=0.573), with ID a95a8626-179d-480e-889d-e5cc76892ce7 -->

Kholo  
Hyena-headed kholo, ever seeking to survive and get ahead in the most pragmatic way possible, make for unreliable neighbors but excel at hunting intelligent prey. Kholo dwell primarily in Garund and are particularly common in Osirion, Katapesh, the Mwangi Expanse, and Nex. Kholo tend to live within matriarchal familial groups with a focus on storytelling and ancestral knowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.398,t=0.581,r=0.905,b=0.680), with ID d76bc8bd-71ed-45ac-b7dc-982374e63479 -->

Kobolds
Industrious and fecund, kobolds thrive anywhere they can, often dwelling in narrow confines and twisting burrows in the hinterlands of rural regions or spreading throughout the sewers of urban centers. These small, reptilian humanoids draw power from magical creatures, gaining abilities and influence from these powerful beings. Many kobold tribes grow around powerful creatures like dragons, fey, or other magical beings, with the kobolds looking to these creatures as leaders or advisors. Scattered in pockets across the Inner Sea, every kobold tribe has its own society and traditions, painstakingly molded to survive their hardscrabble lives. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.399,t=0.689,r=0.905,b=0.834), with ID b56cbe46-f910-447a-b11e-29ea682104cf -->

**Leshies**  
The first leshies were grown by druids as minions, but over time these strange, plantlike creatures have diversified and now take many forms. Leshies have yet to organize or form nations of their own, but considering how quickly their numbers have grown and how swiftly they adapt to new regions, a leshy nation seems all but guaranteed in the near future. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.400,t=0.843,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID e80c0487-4f10-4a3c-b297-fc687d8dd4d9 -->

Lizardfolk  
Once widespread in Avistan and Garund, the isolationist lizardfolk—also known as iruxis—have been forced farther and farther into their forests and swamps by climate change and the rapid expansion of other humanoids. Lizardfolk maintain long-standing oral traditions and a passion for astrology. Most lizardfolk enclaves are found along the waterways of regions like the Broken Lands, Mwangi Expanse, and Shining Kingdoms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.073,r=0.605,b=0.191), with ID 0cd04427-b1a3-4072-bf6c-09575143a328 -->

Orcs
Orcs were pushed to the surface by the dwarves during the Quest for Sky, resulting in a conflict with their neighbors that has tainted their relations since. Now, however, the looming threat of Tar-Baphon has many putting old grudges aside. Most orcs value might and seek opportunities to test their strength against others, be it war, physical contests, or adventuring. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.198,r=0.604,b=0.299), with ID d317940e-9902-4a35-8ebb-846e05ba90c8 -->

**Planar Scions**  
A wide variety of planar scions dwell in the Inner Sea region, including the descendants of celestials and fiends, who have mixed their bloodlines with those of mortals, and other lineages that arose from the influence of the Elemental Planes. In Cheliax, those who exhibit diabolic influences are particularly despised, as the leaders of that nation see them as examples of mortals who succumbed to fiendish influence rather than keeping the devils properly under control. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.305,r=0.604,b=0.421), with ID baee4225-9b1e-40b9-b68e-c5008d8de727 -->

Ratfolk
Ratfolk, also known as ysoki, are famous for their cunning, adaptability, and dedication to their family. This, plus an avid desire to travel, has seen them survive and thrive across the Inner Sea. While some view ratfolk negatively due to their appearance, others see them for the fastidious and curious people they are. Ratfolk enclaves dot the regions of the Broken Lands, Eye of Dread, and Saga Lands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.427,r=0.603,b=0.528), with ID 02ea3740-5e41-4aaa-91b2-4101e270aad2 -->

**Tengu**
Tengu originated in Tian Xia, claimed by legend to have flown to Golarion on shooting stars. A major diaspora saw the crow-like people spread into Avistan and beyond, looking for opportunities and new homes. While small and scattered enclaves can be found around the Inner Sea region, tengu are most often found along the coasts, especially in Absalom and around the Shackles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.535,r=0.602,b=0.635), with ID 5731ebaa-1558-4e72-af4a-05e34d6402c9 -->

REGIONAL LANGUAGES  
These languages are uncommon outside the region of their genesis. A character hailing from one of the regions listed below automatically has access to that language. In the Inner Sea region, the language referred to as Common elsewhere in the rules is the same as Taldane. Nearly every language listed here is spoken on the melting-pot streets of Absalom. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.643,r=0.602,b=0.742), with ID 8b65ba8f-74bf-4a1d-9c24-45c5c3fafade -->

# CREATURES

*Many types of creatures exist on Golarion, some kindly, others cruel, some wild, others organized. Their appearances can range from cute and anthropomorphic to completely monstrous. Even creatures usually opposed to civilization whom brave adventurers might face in battle can sometimes be reasoned with, even befriended. Not all of them are evil, and some actively help their neighbors. And some creatures, of course, simply want to be left alone.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.078,r=0.908,b=0.202), with ID 431a5815-628e-4c04-9101-1292dff0cef0 -->

These creatures have held important cultural or historical
roles on Golarion, particularly in the Inner Sea region. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.231,r=0.514,b=0.267), with ID 666ff470-fb6b-42e1-aab6-f621ce6f53dc -->

Alghollthus  
Perhaps the oldest intelligent creatures on Golarion, alghollthus ruled vast empires in the depths of the world’s oceans for eons before the first humans came to be, with some of their wall carvings even stating they created the first human beings. Moreover, their claim to have existed on Golarion before the gods themselves turned their divine eyes upon the world carries some disturbing implications. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.275,r=0.514,b=0.404), with ID a23fc0c1-7cc5-4b83-a029-2798c7ea6f31 -->

Demons

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a fantastical sea creature named "ALGHOLLTHU," depicted in a dynamic, coiled pose with a menacing expression and bioluminescent appendages.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a serpentine aquatic monster with a long, coiled body and a large, open-mouthed head.
  • The creature has a metallic, armored face with sharp teeth and multiple glowing purple-tipped tendrils extending from its head.
  • The body is dark blue-gray with lighter highlights and fin-like protrusions along the back and tail.
  • The background is plain white, emphasizing the creature.
  • The name "ALGHOLLTHU" appears in a decorative label at the bottom center of the image.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses digital painting techniques with smooth gradients and detailed texturing.
  • The lighting is diffuse, with subtle highlights accentuating the creature's form.
  • The label is in uppercase, gold-bordered text on a brown plaque.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature's head is positioned in the upper left, with the body coiling downward and to the right, creating a sense of movement.
  • The tendrils radiate outward from the head, some curving upward and others downward, adding to the dynamic composition.
  • The tail curves back toward the center, balancing the composition.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of menace and otherworldliness, with the creature's open mouth and glowing appendages drawing attention to its predatory features.
  • The plain background and centered label focus the viewer's attention entirely on the creature, suggesting it is the subject of a bestiary or monster manual entry.
  • The use of cool colors and bioluminescent effects enhances the aquatic and alien qualities of the creature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.468,r=0.527,b=0.951), with ID b8ec0ed7-db64-4bbf-b18b-b3aa683d6699 -->

notable locations where demons have established a lasting
presence include the Sarkoris Scar in the north, Usaro in the
Mwangi Expanse, and the Tanglebriar in southern Kyonin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.233,r=0.904,b=0.282), with ID e0266aef-5398-41d8-8f07-33b117bba4b3 -->

Devils  
Although the rulers of Cheliax maintain that Hell is but a blueprint and devilkind a tool for House Thrune to maintain control of their country (and decadent lifestyle), devils have an insidious hold over the nation. With the state formally devoted to Asmodeus and Hellknights serving as its arbiters, it should come as no surprise that devils are unusually common in Cheliax and neighboring realms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.291,r=0.905,b=0.419), with ID 85b965f1-0563-4db9-a267-d455e6efd759 -->

Dragons
Dragons are rightfully counted among the most legendary
of monsters in the Inner Sea. Most prefer to dwell in remote
lairs, swooping down on civilization only when their violent
tempers push them to raid. Kind dragons may seem less
common than their malevolent kin, but only because they
have less of an urge to meddle with humanoids. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.430,r=0.904,b=0.541), with ID 80303614-86b2-4089-805d-fc558d7addb1 -->

**Genies**  
The nation of Qadira has a long history with genies, but geniekind’s involvement with the Inner Sea region is certainly not limited to that nation. They serve as architects and creators of impossibilities on the isle of Jalmeray, and in Katapesh they’re rumored to be infused into the very stone and soil of the land. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.552,r=0.903,b=0.664), with ID 417c7e96-7e70-4a9e-8648-a86182908cd2 -->

## Giants
These massive humanoids were ruled under the yoke of ancient Thassilon, where they were forced by magic-infused rune giants to erect enormous monuments that remain to this day in Varisia, Belkzen, and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Now, these massive humanoids rule the rugged reaches of the world, largely unaware that they were once part of a society destroyed and reshaped by Thassilon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.673,r=0.903,b=0.804), with ID b7467dd0-3f3c-4365-8e18-727349b4fee1 -->

Serpentfolk  
In ancient times, serpentfolk once ruled the second layer of the Darklands along with much of the surface of Garund and Avistan. Azlant’s expansion into the Inner Sea region long before Earthfall led to a terrible war between the two peoples. When Azlant proved the victor, the surviving serpentfolk fled into the Darklands and haven’t been seen since. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.812,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 29b3b2f1-1ff7-4d06-a9db-b10a44e44cd8 -->

# RELIGION

Selection of a deity is critical for certain classes—like champions and clerics—but most characters pay respect to at least one deity to find a focus in life and guide their choices. Some people instead worship a group of deities arranged in a pantheon, follow a nondeific religion like the Green Faith, or adhere to a philosophy. Keep in mind that far more deities, religions, and philosophies exist on any world, Golarion included, than those detailed below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.077,r=0.867,b=0.203), with ID d1a52167-5c08-43fc-8530-6ddf986760de -->

## DEITIES
Anyone can worship a deity, but those who do so devoutly should take care to pursue the faith’s edicts (behaviors the faith encourages) and avoid its anathemas (actions considered blasphemous). Each deity below has a short description, followed by their edicts and anathemas. For more information on the various deities listed below (and others), see *Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.242,r=0.471,b=0.374), with ID dff0791f-f656-48e0-97ff-2ce81e52e96e -->

Asmodeus  
The Prince of Darkness reigns over contracts, pride, and tyranny, and he delights in tempting mortals to give in to corruption.

Calistria  
The mischievous goddess known as the Savored Sting extols the virtues of lust, revenge, and trickery.

**Erastil**
Old Deadeye is god of family, farming, hunting, and trade. Long ago he was a horned god of the hunt, but his worship evolved to focus on rural communities. His clergy are most often encountered in Avistan’s pastoral or wilderness settlements. In many cases, they’re the only divine presence to be found in such out-of-the-way locales. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.736,r=0.859,b=0.861), with ID af205859-4621-4673-93ff-0e729ead500e -->

Gorum  
Soldiers call out prayers to Our Lord in Iron, god of battle, strength, and weapons. Gorum emphasizes strength and power, encouraging his followers to seek out war and combat as the ultimate way to worship him.

**Gozreh**  
A deity of two aspects, known as the Wind and the Waves, Gozreh rules over nature, the sea, and weather. Gozreh is popular with druids and those who seek to preserve the wilds.

Iomedae

Iomedae is goddess of honor, justice, rulership, and valor, and she is called the Inheritor because she inherited her mantle when the god of humanity perished. Prior to her ascension, Iomedae walked the planet as a mortal. Many paladins follow her faith. She is strongest wherever there is great evil to be vanquished, such as the Gravelands and Sarkoris Scar—despite the rule of Asmodeus in Cheliax, Iomedae’s church is vaguely tolerated there as well, as Iomedae was Chelaxian when she was human.

Irori  
When the Master of Masters attained true enlightenment, he became a god of history, knowledge, and self-perfection.

mortals and populate the world with her twisted and monstrous brood.

Nethys  
Called the All-Seeing Eye, the god of magic, has a dualistic nature of destruction and preservation; his ability to witness all things has shattered his mind.

Pharasama
Ancient and powerful beyond even most other gods, the Lady of Graves presides over birth, death, fate, and prophecy. From her throne in the Boneyard, she judges the souls of all who perish, and she ensures that the natural cycle of birth and death—the River of Souls—is not disrupted. She is widely worshipped across the Inner Sea, often among gravediggers and morticians who deal with death, but also among midwives and doctors who help bring about new life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.630,r=0.904,b=0.784), with ID ef8b5edb-6991-4c9d-95b5-37e1bd4b95cd -->

**Rovagug**

**Sarenrae**  
The Dawnflower is goddess of healing, honesty, redemption, and the sun. Once a powerful angel and empyreal lord, Sarenrae led the charge to imprison Rovagug. She seeks to redeem evil where possible or else destroy it swiftly. Sarenrae’s worship came to the Inner Sea through Qadira and the Empire of Kelish, but her popularity has seen her become a major deity across Avistan and Garund. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.182,r=0.473,b=0.325), with ID 83645fb5-1b36-461a-b588-4f5e23a1a1e6 -->

**Shelyn**
The Eternal Rose is the goddess of art, beauty, love, and music. She seeks to one day redeem her corrupted brother, Zon-Kuthon. Shelyn promotes peace and love, and she encourages her followers to create beauty in a sometimes dark world.

Urgathoa  
The amoral Pallid Princess oversees disease, gluttony, and undeath. Most undead and seekers of undeath pay some token of respect to Urgathoa, though her devotion to feverish excess and overconsumption brings in some adherents among the living as well. Her faith is especially notable in Geb, where the undead have more rights than the living. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.749,r=0.471,b=0.876), with ID 77702943-fff8-4fa5-8179-4e4b6d392009 -->

Zon-Kuthon  
The Midnight Lord is a god of darkness, envy, loss, and pain. Once a god of art, beauty, and music, like Shelyn, he returned from a sojourn in the dark spaces between the planes horribly changed. His worship defines the nation of Nidal, and those Nidalese who do not pay reverence are hounded by Zon-Kuthon's shadow.

# FAITHS AND PHILOSOPHIES
Of course, faith can express itself in more ways than venerating a single deity—or any deity at all. A few examples of nondeific religions and philosophies are presented below. These faiths and philosophies don’t have an external godhead that offers benefits to devotees. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.276,r=0.862,b=0.373), with ID 25b39510-5f2b-482c-be75-6eda7f553be4 -->

![figure: a hand with a blue background]

Atheism  
While most concede that the gods exist, some do not view them as worthy of worship, and a few even deny their presence altogether. The nation of Rahadoum is expressly atheist, after religious wars ravaged the country. It now seeks to glorify the work of mortals and curtail the influence of gods to control or exploit its people.

**Green Faith**
The worshippers of the Green Faith view nature as divine and draw strength from the knowledge of their place in the natural order. Adherents of the Green Faith are commonly found in regions of large forests or pristine wilderness, where awe-inspiring natural wonders easily rival the majesty of the gods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.550,r=0.862,b=0.663), with ID a15898d9-f821-463c-8f78-01d71c80b470 -->

- ![skull icon] Whispering Way

# FACTIONS

*While nations and faiths command vast resources and control entire regions, they must still compete for the loyalty of their followers. In addition to being swayed by church and state, many people are influenced by societal groups known as factions. These groups vary wildly in size and purpose—from local thieves’ guilds interested only in filling the pockets and bellies of their members to far-reaching, international commercial conglomerates with their own private armies.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.077,r=0.910,b=0.217), with ID 330f003b-d6e6-4cc7-a079-687b0fec0b79 -->

The largest factions compete with lesser sovereign nations
for wealth, power, and influence, and they sometimes
rival even larger nations. In some cases, nations take
the risky step of relying upon these powerful factions,
making them an extension of government itself (as is
the case with the **Hellknights in Cheliax**, for example).
In other cases, such as that of the **Red Mantis**, entire
nations bow to the power of these organizations. Smaller
groups, while less rich in resources, nonetheless inspire
great zeal in their members. Those groups that strive to
grow in size, influence, or wealth frequently attract more
dedicated members. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.247,r=0.516,b=0.433), with ID bf30093e-06de-4d1d-8b17-08593bf3fddd -->

The factions summarized below represent a sampling of those active in the Inner Sea region. Some, like the **Pathfinder Society** and the **Aspis Consortium**, are widespread and powerful; their influence can be found throughout the world. Others, such as the **Firebrands** and the **Sczarni**, are disorganized or regional in scope. All encourage adventurers to join their ranks, although the benefits each faction can offer an adventurer varies widely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.434,r=0.516,b=0.571), with ID 54c05f6d-8c12-4d77-a516-bead610fb4eb -->

Aspis Consortium
For the sprawling mercantile concern known as the Aspis Consortium, survival and profit are more important than the well-being of any single member. Originally founded as a private trading endeavor, the Consortium has grown to be one of the largest business ventures in the Inner Sea region. Most of the group’s members are skilled merchants and mercenaries, and the organization has made a merciless and bloodthirsty name for itself when it comes to ensuring profits. The Aspis Consortium has clashed many times with the Pathfinder Society. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.582,r=0.515,b=0.785), with ID 08f3d063-196d-4a51-b3de-a004269ed30d -->

# Bellflower Network
The halfling population in diabolic Cheliax has suffered a history of brutal oppression and engrained discrimination.

It should come as no surprise, then, to learn of the Bellflower Network, an organization founded by halfling freedom fighters that accepts any into its ranks, provided they help the oppressed fight back or escape from lands like Cheliax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.789,r=0.515,b=0.941), with ID 74ea4871-c460-4f89-850d-9010ed9a4d7d -->

Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye  
Based in the nation of Ustalav, the scholars and philosophers of this semisecret society have long stood against the Whispering Way (page 163), but more recent events have placed them in opposition to the sinister goals of the Night Heralds. When left to their own devices, however, members of this faction prefer to explore and study dusty secrets hidden in the past, particularly those still awaiting rediscovery in the regions of the Golden Road—especially in the nation of Osirion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.244,r=0.906,b=0.435), with ID 221514de-9b3a-45e0-8765-9d56e85c0fad -->

# Eagle Knights

The Eagle Knights are the protectors and defenders of the people of Andoran. The group itself consists of four subfactions—the Steel Falcons (who protect Andoran’s interests beyond its borders), the Golden Legion (Andoran’s defenders and the commanders of its armies), the Gray Corsairs (pirate hunters who also protect ships from Chelaxian pursuit), and the Twilight Talons (spies and deep cover agents). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.443,r=0.906,b=0.603), with ID a4981b36-b1a2-4198-b1de-2b26c1ced123 -->

Firebrands  
Not all factions have central bases of operation or organized hierarchies of command. The loosely affiliated freedom fighters, swashbuckling heroes, and entertainers known as the Firebrands are one such group. They are united by a desire to fight oppression, oppose tyrannical regimes, rescue the wrongfully accused, and engage in jolly cooperation with like-minded heroes—all while building their own individual reputations and wealth. This group of defenders has proven surprisingly difficult for oppressive governments and cruel religions to defeat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.611,r=0.906,b=0.815), with ID d9304c0b-2b12-47c9-b56f-cf0d1a1878f8 -->

Free Captains
To an outside observer or a merchant whose ship has been looted or sunk, the pirates of the Shackles may seem like a disorganized scourge. But in truth, they're bound by a complex code of, if not honor, then a mutual recognition that it's good to have allies on the open seas.

Hellknights  
Several different orders of the mercenaries known collectively as Hellknights operate in Avistan, with most of their number stationed in the nation of Cheliax. These mercenaries see the law of the land as inviolate and offer their services as enforcers to any who can pay their prices. They wear distinctive suits of intimidating armor and take the legends of Hell as inspiration. They see no one but themselves as the true arbiters of law. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.167,r=0.472,b=0.327), with ID 91d7aa7e-aab8-442c-9b4b-29a101b4c83e -->

# Knights of Lastwall
For centuries, the nation of Lastwall stood as a bulwark against the orcs of Belkzen and the lingering threat of the Whispering Tyrant. When the Whispering Tyrant escaped his prison, he unleashed a devastating apocalypse upon his enemies in Lastwall. Now Lastwall is destroyed, and the knights who once served there are without a home. In its absence, they have formed a ragtag group known as the Knights of Lastwall, and they carry on their charge to stand against the undead legions of the Whispering Tyrant wherever their skills are needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.335,r=0.472,b=0.526), with ID da0bcca4-71ee-45d3-b84c-e4ff974f7741 -->

logo: green and blue shield with a gold crown and a white lion

# Lion Blades
The Lion Blades of Taldor are a secret organization committed to protecting the interests of Taldor and its ruler. They oppose Taldor’s many enemies, foreign and domestic, through a program of infiltration, espionage, and assassination. One of the major goals of the Lion Blades is to rein in corruption within the empire (aside from corruption that’s useful to them); another is keeping any one faction of the imperial court from becoming powerful enough to upset the status quo. Through its shadow schools, the Lion Blades intensively train new recruits before investing them with a high degree of initiative and latitude. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.536,r=0.471,b=0.756), with ID fe53db0d-c618-4958-bdca-544052dba1f9 -->

### Magaambya
Golarion reeled from the disaster of Earthfall, and its peoples took long to recover. But recover they did, and one of the first institutions to rise from the ashes of near destruction was the Magaambya, an academy of arcane learning founded by the legendary wizard known as Old-Mage Jatembe. Today, the scholars of Magaambya not only preserve ancient magical traditions founded in those early days but also protect the learning and culture of the Mwangi people as a whole. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.766,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 7fc75027-3543-463f-80d4-3eb6edd40a9d -->

logo: purple triangle with a circle and dot inside, surrounded by a black ring

### Night Heralds
The Night Heralds turn to the lure of the starlit night for guidance, seeking advice and aid from forces far removed from Golarion. The sinister aliens of the Dominion of the Black hold special importance for the Night Heralds, and many Night Heralds worship these inscrutable beings almost as gods. Night Heralds collect obscure texts and mysterious lore from the ancient past and use the secrets they find within to unravel larger hidden meanings and obscured truths beyond reality. Their hope is that when Golarion inevitably falls to alien influence, they will be rewarded for their service by the world’s new masters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.077,r=0.862,b=0.296), with ID 10cd2148-a485-490f-97bd-acbb6f3cc9e6 -->

# Pathfinder Society

Many of the greatest explorers and adventurers of the modern age have recorded their discoveries in an ongoing series of chapbooks known as the *Pathfinder Chronicles*, published irregularly by the Pathfinder Society itself. This diverse group is devoted to exploring the world, supporting its agents in the field, and ensuring the discoveries they make are documented. The Society often finds itself in conflict with the more mercenary Aspis Consortium. The Pathfinder Society’s pursuit of discovery often puts its agents in the thick of developing plots, forcing them to choose between becoming heroes or villains as events unfold. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.306,r=0.862,b=0.526), with ID 093bb0fb-78ae-4889-8e68-34ffa18f7cc8 -->

## Red Mantis

[inline micro-figure: red mantis mandibles icon]

It’s easy to know if an assassination is the work of the notorious Red Mantis; they typically kill with a sacred sawtooth saber, have a knack for targeting their victims in public or in sanctuaries believed to be safe, and take steps to ensure that those they are contracted to kill stay dead. Their prices change with each mission, but no matter the offer, the Red Mantis never targets rightfully ruling monarchs—their own deity, the mantis god Achaekek, forbids the murder of those with a divine mandate to rule. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.536,r=0.861,b=0.724), with ID e7725565-78f9-410b-b55a-cf247cd61d9f -->

Szcarni  
The Szcarni are a collection of bandits, smugglers, and thieves centered in Varisia. They are organized into tightly knit families, each of which has little or nothing in common with Szcarni in other locations beyond shared skills, techniques, and pursuits. Their crimes focus on thievery, scams, and other relatively nonviolent acts, but since these crimes have a tendency to spiral out of control, their schemes often result in violence anyway. The most far reaching or far-sighted of Szcarni familes are always on the lookout for new opportunities, especially in new nations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.735,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 46c6b0c5-97ce-436a-8c9b-8d664ed5805c -->

# NATIONS

*From the smallest of city-states to a continent-spanning empire, nations define the political landscape of a setting and inform local culture and traditions. Knowing the details of a nation can help you as a Game Master, whether your game revolves around international disputes or you simply need to know what languages the common people are likely to speak.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.130,t=0.536,r=0.915,b=0.651), with ID ffdf9819-b445-4a3d-befb-9f27edeeccf5 -->

Nations vary tremendously, from massive empires to isolated
island realms, and their characteristics can give flavor and
depth to your story and the PCs’ adventures. An encounter in
shadowy **Nidal**, where allegiance to Zon-Kuthon has literally
blocked the sun from the sky, is going to have a very different
tone than one in sun-drenched **Thuvia**. A nation that serves
as a cultural or ancestral bastion, like elven **Kyonin**, might
have a different reaction to adventurers than a continent-
defining empire like **Taldor**. A journey into a new nation
can introduce the heroes to a new people (if the party visits
the hobgoblin nation of **Oprak**), a new philosophy (such as
the materialistic Prophecies of Kalistrade in **Druma**), or a
new foe (as visitors to the undead-ridden **Gravelands** will
certainly learn). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.677,r=0.514,b=0.892), with ID bba133f9-98b1-4ac8-9e7d-f7e757c838d9 -->

Nations can also provide adventuring inspiration  
and hooks. When the heroes are caught in the crossfire  
between two nations in conflict, national concerns <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.894,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID 1874f6f6-50b5-42c0-aa7f-77e9dd732c6f -->

become their own. Learning more about a nation’s
history or practices might lead to a great finding—or a
loathsome practice the characters want to eradicate. A
party might get involved in the political machinations of
a nation’s elite power mongers, or they might fall out of
favor and find themselves on the run from the law! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.680,r=0.905,b=0.770), with ID 4f6930af-0acc-4c7c-afe7-dc60147a3782 -->

Nations also influence a character’s story on a personal
level. A nation can suggest a character’s ancestry, inform
the languages they speak, and influence their choice of
deity. As a GM, the relationship between a character and
a nation can provide opportunities to better hook that
character into your campaign. Has the character always
lived there, or have they emigrated from elsewhere—and
why? A character who fled due to political persecution
might have long-standing enemies, while a hero who left
due to ideological differences might have friends and
family who seek to return them to the fold. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.771,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID 09913b9a-89d1-4fcd-8df2-5c7edf84287e -->

# Nation Stat Block
The stat block for a nation presents the core information about a nation in a simple, streamlined format. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.074,r=0.471,b=0.128), with ID 6a8da2e4-c533-4df8-91bc-fbe093abdc84 -->

NATION NAME                                      NATION

TRAITS
As with any stat block, a nation has a list of traits that convey its properties at a glance. These traits are overarching characteristics, but don’t necessarily reflect every person or settlement that might be encountered—a nation is rarely monolithic, and the attitudes or cultural makeup of its people may differ drastically from those of the nation as a whole. For example, the elven nation of Kyonin has the elf trait, indicating that it was created by and remains almost exclusively populated by elves. Similarly, a nation with an extremely particular focus might have a trait to represent that, such as Galt, which has the revolutionary trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.136,r=0.473,b=0.326), with ID fdd4c468-c1c2-4569-9246-4bb769540591 -->

Following the traits is a brief summary of the nation.
**Government** This names the formal government and describes the nation’s governmental structure, such as a hereditary monarchy, an elected council, or a theocratic dictatorship.
**Capital** This is the established seat of the nation’s government, with the city’s population in parentheses.
**Population** The predominant ancestries of the nation are listed here, ordered from most to least common. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.324,r=0.472,b=0.448), with ID 9f59c7ea-9463-4b05-b1cb-239870fa29c9 -->

**Languages** The languages commonly spoken in the nation appear here, listed alphabetically. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.449,r=0.470,b=0.478), with ID 3686b9ff-34f1-409e-b60a-f41f629994c3 -->

Religions This lists the religions and philosophies commonly practiced in the nation. If a nation has a state religion, this is indicated in parentheses following that religion. If a nation has prohibited any religions, those are listed in a Prohibited entry following the common religions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.479,r=0.470,b=0.556), with ID 37b671ee-5658-4913-83ae-4c368d375f26 -->

**Other Characteristics** A nation might have distinctive features that set it apart from other nations, such as the predominance of firearms in Alkenstar. Each such feature is detailed in this entry, though a nation rarely has more than one or two of these entries, and many don't have any. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.556,r=0.470,b=0.632), with ID edc181e5-307a-46d6-8a4d-f7016963c0eb -->

**Primary Exports** This lists the nation's primary exports, such as raw materials, finished goods, services, and other resources. If the nation has no exports of note, this entry is omitted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.633,r=0.469,b=0.678), with ID 6db06eac-8c08-4b2d-b5e9-09be1304b463 -->

**Primary Imports** Much like primary exports, this entry details the resources commonly imported by the nation. Like exports, if the nation has no imports of note, this entry is omitted.

**Allies** This entry lists other nations, and occasionally large organizations, allied with the nation. It is omitted for nations with no significant relationships. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.679,r=0.470,b=0.769), with ID 96878c37-57a0-439f-aa1b-a910fc49aae2 -->

Enemies Other nations (and sometimes organizations) that oppose the nation appear here. This entry is omitted for nations with no enemies to speak of. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.770,r=0.469,b=0.816), with ID 5776bb96-9db8-4f4e-9643-5ce416296a78 -->

**Factions** Any significant organizations or factions operating within the nation are listed in this entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.817,r=0.469,b=0.846), with ID ee08e5b5-f7b1-459b-86d0-08ec8eb86675 -->

**Threats** This entry lists various threats the nation faces, such  
as aggression from neighboring nations, natural disasters,  
economic instability, magical anomalies, and so on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.846,r=0.469,b=0.891), with ID 3ef4ba1f-46ca-4a2d-b665-7a0774629c99 -->

Significant NPCs The final section of the nation's stat block presents the most significant NPCs of that nation, including its ruler (if it has one). These may not be the most powerful or <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.892,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 1fdc8417-032d-4380-b680-25e381e6db62 -->

influential individuals in the nation, and instead are those most
likely to be known by people within and outside of the nation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.079,r=0.861,b=0.114), with ID efe686e7-a02f-4428-89ad-4c3a11f43c30 -->

# SETTLEMENTS

*Adventures have to start somewhere, and everyone needs some semblance of a home. Settlements are where characters can rest, recharge, retrain, and dedicate themselves to other downtime activities, all in relative peace. But settlements can also hold their own intrigues and dangers, providing adventure opportunities of their own.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.079,r=0.907,b=0.187), with ID 8163f4f4-985f-4858-8a1b-be9bc409317b -->

For some players, a settlement might be nothing more than a convenient place to purchase gear and sell loot. For others, a settlement might be a beloved home they’re willing to risk everything to protect. And sometimes, an entire campaign takes place entirely within the walls of a single city. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.218,r=0.515,b=0.311), with ID 51f7a0c6-4cec-41b3-b7c0-2cc67784d9ce -->

# SETTLEMENTS IN A GAME
Given the variety of roles a settlement can play in an adventure, a Game Master should have a firm understanding of how they work in the game and how to best use them. Virtually every settlement uses the rules for urban environments presented starting on page 92. Those rules are primarily intended for encounter mode, however, and so the following guidance can help you best use a settlement in the broader narrative of your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.321,r=0.515,b=0.480), with ID d29842d1-c7f3-419a-a252-a291d241ecde -->

## Settlement Adventures
Designing adventures in a settlement generally follows
the guidelines presented in **Adventure Design** on page 68.
However, a settlement’s greater population density also
allows for a number of adventure styles and elements
that aren’t as common beyond the city walls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.491,r=0.514,b=0.586), with ID 98d75406-925f-4987-a027-1704d3af1caa -->

Social encounters are one of the most common
interactions within a settlement, starting with the
guards at the city gates all the way to an audience with
the queen. The **influence and reputation** subsystems
(pages 187 and 200, respectively) can facilitate these
interactions in a more structured way. **Chase scenes,**
using the rules starting on page 192, are an iconic
component of a settlement adventure, especially in
a larger city where dense buildings and a variety of
structures make for an exciting series of obstacles. A
settlement is also an ideal place for a party to conduct
an **infiltration** (page 196). Since most libraries, archives,
and similar repositories of information are located
within settlements, you might make use of the **research
rules** (page 190). Ambitious characters might want to
build up their own organizations using the **leadership
subsystem** (page 204). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.588,r=0.514,b=0.848), with ID 00312999-8a09-4596-ba7a-da58f4ca59d7 -->

Modes of Play  
Just like in other adventure locations, all three modes of play can happen in settlements. Since a settlement presents far more opportunities for noncombat activities than most other environments, characters <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.859,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID b2674f1c-c8a6-4b95-936a-4e242130c6f1 -->

likely spend most of their time in **exploration mode. Downtime** almost exclusively takes place within a settlement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.218,r=0.905,b=0.265), with ID 0318381f-7094-4868-9f5f-4b44956dcac1 -->

Marketplaces
Where there are people, there is commerce. The Buying and Selling Items section on page 48 provides several sets of guidelines for handling commerce in your game, but it can also be helpful to have a sense of what items and economic power a given settlement has on its own merits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.276,r=0.905,b=0.386), with ID f9c4cc4f-a5dc-40b2-8ce9-8c8827c9b5f1 -->

In a given settlement, a character can usually
purchase any **common** item (including formulas,
alchemical items, and magic items) that’s of the same
or lower level than the settlement’s. Usually, fewer of
the highest-level items are available—you can use the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.388,r=0.903,b=0.464), with ID 7d3f40b7-6cc1-439d-90e0-638a8459d9c5 -->

Party Treasure by Level table on page 59 as a guideline
for how many of the highest-level items might be
available, using the Permanent Items and Consumables
entries for a level one lower than the settlement’s actual
level. Inhabitants of a settlement can usually purchase
items from PCs as long as those items are the same
or lower level than the settlement, with limitations on
higher-level items similar to those available for sale. If a
settlement’s population is significantly smaller than its
level would suggest, its ability to provide and purchase
items might be more limited. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.465,r=0.904,b=0.632), with ID 8d368463-e8ab-4597-b8b9-da903bb63d1c -->

If a character’s level is higher than the settlement’s,
that character can usually use their own influence and
leverage to acquire higher-level items, as they convince
shops to place specialty orders or artisans to craft
custom goods, though it might take a bit of time for
such orders to be fulfilled. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.633,r=0.903,b=0.723), with ID 24e66bcc-953e-4cfd-a435-891d6449e34e -->

**Spellcasting services** are available in many settlements. Barring a powerful spellcasting NPC in the city with whom the party could negotiate for services, a character can find someone to cast common spells up to a level that could be cast by an NPC of the settlement’s level. For example, a character in a 9th-level city can typically find and pay someone to cast a 5th-rank common spell— the highest spell available to a 9th-level spellcaster. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.725,r=0.903,b=0.846), with ID 845a2302-e745-494e-ab63-61493678f69f -->

Some settlements have access to uncommon items,
formulas, and spells. If a settlement could reasonably
be considered to meet the Access entry for an item
or spell, that item or spell is available just like any
common item. For example, the dwarven settlement of
Kragodgan has plenty of dwarf weapons available. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.848,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 0d5b506b-e29b-4e79-b2b2-6d91773ed2fa -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-themed illustration showing two characters in detailed costume, standing in a misty, medieval village at night, with a dramatic moonlit sky and a shadowy figure on a rooftop in the background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two main characters in the foreground: one in gold armor with a sword and red backpack, the other in elaborate robes with a staff adorned with antlers and red ribbons.
  • Setting is a cobblestone street flanked by tall, gabled houses with glowing windows, under a night sky with a full moon.
  • A mysterious, silhouetted figure with a scythe stands on the roof of the central house, backlit by the moon.
  • The color palette is dominated by cool blues and greys, with warm orange and yellow highlights from the windows and armor.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar, text, or UI elements.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with strong moonlight and warm window glows creating contrast.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with intricate costume designs and atmospheric effects like mist and clouds.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The armored character is on the left, gesturing with one hand toward the robed character on the right.
  • The robed character holds a staff and has long white hair, standing slightly behind the armored character.
  • The shadowy rooftop figure is centered above and between the two main characters, drawing the viewer’s eye upward.
  • The composition uses rule-of-thirds, with the characters occupying the lower two-thirds and the moon/figure in the upper third.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of tension and narrative, suggesting an encounter or confrontation, possibly with the rooftop figure as a looming threat.
  • The use of lighting and color creates a dramatic, immersive fantasy atmosphere.
  • The detailed costumes and props indicate the characters’ roles (warrior and mage or shaman), while the background sets a mysterious, possibly dangerous scene. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.061,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 1b4a8ba9-576b-4658-98a1-9fdbf7d417a7 -->

Power Structures  
Outside of city limits, adventurers spend much of their time operating on their own terms, accountable only to their moral code. But in a settlement, the heroes become part of a larger system with its own codified laws, procedures, and enforcement. The details of a settlement’s power structures shape the party’s interactions within that settlement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.536,r=0.471,b=0.664), with ID 6a351fa4-0275-4911-80b1-da5e175c4f54 -->

Government
The government of a settlement often reflects the nature
of that settlement. A law-abiding, militaristic city likely
has a hierarchical government with a single figure at
the top; a crossroads market town might be under the
control of its wealthiest merchant families; and a farming
community might simply look to the oldest residents for
leadership as necessary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.675,r=0.471,b=0.801), with ID 5916f0c9-d5b7-4806-8992-005047f572be -->

That said, the legal and publicly recognized ruler of
a settlement isn’t always the one calling the shots. They
could merely be a puppet to a secret entity that silently
pulls the strings from the shadows. Some settlements
are ruled by hidden coteries, from strange religious
sects to thieves’ guilds. A settlement might be swayed
by politically powerful residents, such as an occult
vizier or a politically savvy high priest. In some cases,
the legitimate authority might seem to govern but has <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.802,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID a73fb19f-0117-4027-9701-4d895c79d83b -->

actually been replaced by a faceless stalker, a devil in  
disguise, or another powerful shapechanger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.540,r=0.861,b=0.573), with ID 2b4e0c1c-5f75-40b7-86e7-98e54fdf6fea -->

**Legal Codes**  
Most civilizations agree that laws are necessary to ensure a functioning society. The specific laws range from one settlement to another, and they might be as simple as a prohibition against murder and theft to exceptionally convoluted regulatory schemes dictating everything from clothing details to available confections. How well known these laws are can further flavor a party’s interactions with that settlement, as it’s likely easier to navigate a well-documented system than one in which the rules are learned only through experience and word of mouth. Generally speaking, a more bureaucratic settlement is likely to have more complex laws, and a laxer locale to have fewer and simpler laws. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.585,r=0.862,b=0.801), with ID b8fb6c9e-c8a6-4b13-a19b-f81237276fa6 -->

Law Enforcement  
Most settlements have systems in place to enforce their laws. In a small village, residents might police themselves, holding one another accountable to their shared values. Towns and larger settlements usually have some system of guards, whether that’s a post filled by a rotation of volunteers or a city guard of professionals paid by the city’s government to maintain order. Many settlements <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.815,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 932fa4e5-4802-4dfd-95a2-c57b1d523ac7 -->

Organizations, Churches, and Factions  
The government isn’t the only influential factor in a settlement. Prestigious organizations, prominent churches, and specialized factions all wield power as well, often in conflict with the official government or one another. Religious congregations usually wield significant power in communities where faith is strong. An organization can wield overt influence over the community where they’re based, or subtle control, as the Pathfinder Society does in Absalom. In a small settlement, a wizard, sorcerer, or bard of even moderate magical talent would be a rare and influential member of society. Other notable factions might include noble houses, wealthy merchants, innkeepers, and retired soldiers and adventurers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.139,r=0.515,b=0.467), with ID e342af2a-8721-4c5f-b065-d251d27062b2 -->

Corruption
In any settlement, it’s possible for
officials to put their own interests
before those of the people they serve.
Corruption might be as simple as a clerk
willing to accept a bribe to expedite some paperwork,
or it might be as sinister as falsely punishing citizens to
cover up the official’s crimes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.475,r=0.516,b=0.604), with ID 9eb77103-5bde-40fa-a5c0-d12f811c1201 -->

Settlement Stat Block  
A settlement’s stat block consolidates the basic information about a settlement into a centralized format. Typical contents of settlement statistics are listed below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.611,r=0.515,b=0.695), with ID 5f0390d2-0729-4531-b1b2-3c554ad9f908 -->

SETTLEMENT NAME                SETTLEMENT (LEVEL)
TYPE   OTHER
The first elements of a settlement stat block are its name and level. A settlement’s level represents its relative size and economic capacity as well as roughly corresponds to the maximum level of NPC that can be found there, not counting significant NPCs listed below. In general, any common items with a level no higher than the settlement’s level are available for purchase (though a character of a higher level can usually ferret out or custom order higher-level items). In addition, the settlement’s level is used to help determine the maximum possible task level that could become available there to Earn Income (Player Core 228). Both these are simply guidelines, however, and a GM should make exceptions at their discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.704,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID ad70a045-dcc3-4982-84af-faa14db7b2f8 -->

Following the settlement’s heading are its traits. The first of these is the trait representing the settlement’s type: village, town, city, or metropolis. This trait generally reflects the size of the settlement, but it also tends to correlate to a settlement’s level. A village is usually level 0–1, a town level 2–4, a city level 5–7, and a metropolis 8 or above, though the presence of many higher-level or wealthy residents could easily skew the level of a village, town, or city upwards. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.076,r=0.906,b=0.199), with ID e6378143-1475-4e70-99d0-c244869574fe -->

logo: A blue and gold heraldic shield with a bird in flight, set against a circular background.

A settlement might have other traits in addition to its type trait. For example, the dwarven sky citadel of Kraggodan has the **dwarf** trait since it was built and is predominantly occupied by dwarves. The city of Lepidstadt in Ustalav has the **academic** trait due to its focus around the prestigious University of Lepidstadt.

Following the settlement’s traits is a simple sentence that provides a short description of the settlement and its role in the story or region.
**Government** This entry describes the settlement’s governing entity, such as a mayor, the town elder, an elected council, and so on.
**Population** The settlement’s total population is listed here, followed by a breakdown of the population by ancestry in parentheses.
**Languages** The languages commonly spoken in the settlement are listed here, ordered alphabetically. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.480,t=0.200,r=0.909,b=0.567), with ID 8715605c-2b17-4ffa-a5b8-8ebe10a622f4 -->

Religions This entry lists the religions and philosophies commonly practiced in the settlement. If the settlement has an official religion, that’s indicated in parenthesis. If the settlement has prohibited any religions or philosophies, those are listed in a Prohibited entry following the Religions entry.
Threats This entry lists the major threats facing the settlement, such as ongoing drought or famine, political uprisings, criminal activity, and the like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.559,r=0.904,b=0.692), with ID cc676f93-7dc8-4291-bd65-664ae781ac44 -->

**Other Characteristics** A settlement might have distinctive features that affect its residents or visitors entering the city, such as a particular trade that makes certain items more available. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.693,r=0.904,b=0.754), with ID 7105de57-aad4-41ee-8a76-a78522dd9a8f -->

**Significant NPCs** The final section of the settlement stat block presents the most significant NPCs of that settlement. This usually includes the settlement’s official leader, if one is present and if it’s a single person. It also includes other movers and shakers, local celebrities, and persons of particular interest to adventurers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.754,r=0.903,b=0.848), with ID 05bb5ca9-cd1e-4ff6-9753-587f514c0fd8 -->

Sample Settlement Abilities
Here are some common settlement abilities you can use to customize a settlement of your own creation.
  Artists’ Haven: Residents of this city have a deep appreciation for fine art. It’s easier to find higher-level <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.859,r=0.903,b=0.940), with ID 8990aebd-1d71-4f45-b3d4-61fe2c8782ba -->

AGE OF LOST OMENS <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.651,t=0.018,r=0.870,b=0.044), with ID 95bf8115-28e2-4a1e-a756-12446ea3bdf6 -->

Otari, a town located on the Isle of Kortos with strong
connections to Absalom. You can use these as examples
when building your own settlement stat blocks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.078,r=0.863,b=0.129), with ID 760bde61-4622-433d-a615-9b5902b08a3c -->

tasks to Earn Income involving Performance or art as
well as buyers willing to pay more for art objects.
   City of Artisans: The settlement is famous for a
particular good, such as armor and weapons. Items of
up to four levels higher than the settlement level are
available from that particular category. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.079,r=0.471,b=0.172), with ID e00445d7-d5b9-4e18-a53a-89250086c3c2 -->

Magical Academy: The settlement prides itself on teaching magic, and its residents are skilled at teaching others. Choose a magical tradition or traditions suitable to your settlement. When a PC pays an NPC to teach them a new spell of that tradition in the settlement, the NPC assists the process and provides an additional +2 circumstance bonus to the check to Learn the Spell. In addition, at the GM’s discretion, spells and rituals with the uncommon trait might be available in this settlement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.173,r=0.471,b=0.310), with ID 0cdffe4a-198a-4333-bc58-ccacfd46d74f -->

**Religious Bias:** This settlement has a strong affiliation with a particular religion. Anyone who’s visibly a worshipper of that specific deity gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression, Request, and Gather Information. Characters who visibly worship one of that deity’s foes take a –1 circumstance penalty to the same actions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.310,r=0.471,b=0.418), with ID a5bdfd85-29ff-47fe-bfa7-6e377bed1961 -->

**Scholarly:** An abundance of public libraries or other accessible places of learning within this settlement means that with 1d4 hours, a character can access a scholarly journal on a relevant common subject (*Player Core* 290) before attempting to Recall Knowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.418,r=0.471,b=0.496), with ID c1e2c0d6-fdca-46a7-ab8a-5bcb91a9822c -->

## Changing a Settlement
Sometimes the characters spend a long period of time in a single settlement. Perhaps it’s their home base, where they spend their downtime between adventures, or perhaps the entire adventure takes place there. In these cases, you might find you need to update your settlement stat block as it changes over time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.505,r=0.471,b=0.617), with ID 82b57af2-980f-4587-9fb0-b409b5e225ee -->

Several elements of the settlement stat block are
simple to update; you change the population as it grows
or shrinks, and you change the leaders on your stat
block as different people move between those positions.
But you also might make changes that reflect the results
of the PCs’ adventures. If the heroes eliminated a major
threat facing the settlement, you should remove that
threat from the stat block—but if they drew the wrath
of a new foe in doing so, you might add that new threat!
You can also update the stat block’s abilities, should the
PCs’ actions have that large an influence on the city. For
example, if the party (using the leadership subsystem on
page 204) built up a wizard school focused on crafting
magical items, you might add an ability to the settlement
stat block that increased the availability of magic items
in the settlement’s markets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.617,r=0.471,b=0.862), with ID a3dd86cf-c59a-4110-941d-a07bdcca723c -->

Settlements of Lost Omens
Presented below are stat blocks for two settlements from the Lost Omens campaign setting: Port Peril, a dangerous and lawless city in the islands known as the Shackles, and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.873,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID 35696586-0616-4d71-b0fc-ed241faab83a -->

**Pirate Town** Port Peril thrives on black market and stolen goods. Items that might be difficult to acquire or dispose of in other settlements due to legality can be purchased and sold more easily in Port Peril. NPCs begin with an attitude one step worse than usual toward characters openly displaying insignia of law enforcement agencies, religious iconography of law-enforcing deities such as Iomedae or Abadar, or affiliation with a nation known for persecuting pirates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.311,r=0.861,b=0.447), with ID 064dac8c-a888-4986-ac0b-0e39f84f28cc -->

# THE PLANES

*Past the world of Golarion and the void of space lie the vast planes of existence referred to as the Great Beyond. Often alien and dangerous, most of these planes embody some foundational aspect of reality—one of the chief elements that make up the rest of the multiverse or a kind of fundamental energy. Each plane is a reality unto itself, with its own laws of existence and its own native inhabitants who might visit, grant benefits to residents of, or cause havoc on the face of Golarion.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.079,r=0.911,b=0.217), with ID 018f3a99-bcb9-4398-981f-c3178e0e4bd1 -->

# Planar Traits
Each plane, dimension, and demiplane has its own properties and attributes. Planar traits can be broken down into five categories: scope, gravity, time, morphic, and planar essence. Combined, those traits describe the laws and makeup of the plane. These appear in the plane’s traits entry, though any trait that matches the Universe (described in the Normal entry in each section below) is omitted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.243,r=0.515,b=0.373), with ID ced305f9-4242-4146-93d6-327e00e65dbd -->

Scope Trait  
Most planes are immeasurable, so immense they’re impossible to quantify. Which immeasurable planes, if any, are infinite is a subject of debate among philosophers and scholars alike. Since so many planes are immeasurable, those planes omit a scope trait. Otherwise, the plane likely has either the finite or unbounded trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.383,r=0.514,b=0.494), with ID f82beec5-d067-4b9b-884d-68b1d6e80071 -->

**Finite:** Finite planes consist of a limited amount of space.  
**Immeasurable:** Immeasurable planes are immeasurably large, perhaps infinite. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.494,r=0.513,b=0.541), with ID 158813c3-2688-4c88-9dcc-da73a482961f -->

**Unbounded:** Unbounded planes loop back on themselves when a creature reaches the plane’s “edge.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.540,r=0.513,b=0.572), with ID 95b85b0d-0680-4a4b-8c44-1d048f5ba6b6 -->

Gravity Traits
Many planes have unusual gravity.
   Normal: Bodies of great mass are the centers of gravity, and objects fall toward those centers with a measured amount of force relative to the size of the body. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.581,r=0.513,b=0.663), with ID 2febd4b4-5bea-459a-9bd8-8603f3b5fd68 -->

**High Gravity:** As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size of the body is greater than in the Universe. The Bulk of all creatures and objects is doubled, meaning creatures acclimated to normal gravity can carry only half as much. Creatures used to normal gravity move at half Speed and can jump only half as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are impossible beyond the third range increment (instead of the sixth). Creatures that fall in high gravity take bludgeoning damage equal to the distance they fell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.664,r=0.513,b=0.816), with ID ea9f2da1-5aa5-44e9-83f5-ca6b9a525a5b -->

Low Gravity: As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size of the body is less than in the Universe. The Bulk of all creatures and objects is halved, meaning creatures acclimated to normal gravity can carry twice as much and jump twice as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are possible up to the twelfth range increment (instead of the sixth). Creatures that fall in low gravity take no damage for the first 10 feet of a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.817,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 5634d5de-35f5-4c5c-9cb4-c88f68ee0987 -->

fall, and then take bludgeoning damage equal to a quarter of  
the remaining distance it fell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.249,r=0.905,b=0.279), with ID ca9835da-5e04-4934-ab6c-7a7d617022c1 -->

**Microgravity:** There’s little to no gravity on this plane. Creatures float in space unless they can push off a surface or use some force to propel themselves throughout the plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.281,r=0.903,b=0.326), with ID 2cfe870e-9175-4093-9d71-4e025445f828 -->

**Strange Gravity:** All bodies of mass are centers of gravity with roughly the same force. A creature can stand on any solid objects that’s as large as or larger than themself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.327,r=0.903,b=0.372), with ID 913176a5-0ad6-4a99-b42f-eca962a2509b -->

**Subjective Gravity:** All bodies of mass can be centers of gravity with the same force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it. Unattended items, objects, and mindless creatures treat the plane as having microgravity. Creatures on a plane with subjective gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining “down” near their feet. Designating this downward direction is a free action that has the concentration trait. If suspended in midair, a creature can replicate flight by choosing a “down” direction and falling in that direction, moving up to their Speed or fly Speed. This pseudo-flight uses the Fly action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.373,r=0.905,b=0.541), with ID fa508b5e-f7da-4d4b-bf13-1eb9d94ccd48 -->

Time Traits  
Time flows differently on many planes.  
   Normal: Time passes the same way it does in the Universe. One hour on a plane with normal time equals 1 hour in the Universe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.552,r=0.903,b=0.631), with ID b4e21d96-98e4-4df7-b6c3-eab02d1c1468 -->

**Erratic:** Time slows down and speeds up, so an individual might lose or gain time as they move between planes. When a creature moves from a plane with erratic time to one with normal time, roll a DC 11 flat check. Creatures that leave an erratic time plane together share the same result. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.633,r=0.903,b=0.708), with ID 419aaad0-f2f6-4fd1-a0c3-67b3a2e9698d -->

**Success** Time passed normally on the erratic time plane.  
**Failure** For each hour spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.709,r=0.901,b=0.755), with ID f8382666-0e93-4b68-96ff-1379423010aa -->

**Critical Failure** For each round spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.755,r=0.903,b=0.785), with ID ab7b8bfa-eae3-4d57-a251-c130309787c4 -->

Flowing: The flow of time is consistently faster or slower. A creature might travel to one of these planes, spend a year there, and find that only an hour passed in the Universe; alternatively, they might spend a minute on this plane and find out an hour passed in the Universe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.787,r=0.903,b=0.862), with ID 96d8a65a-1e59-4dd6-b63a-c4e9239580ef -->

**Timeless:** Time still passes, but the effects of time are
diminished. Creatures on these planes don’t feel hunger,
thirst, or the effects of aging or natural healing. The effects
of poison, diseases, and other kinds of healing might also
be diminished on certain timeless planes. Spell energy and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.863,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 30715a10-b779-410e-affd-6bee973dec3e -->

other effects still dissipate, so the durations of spells and
other effects function as normal. The danger of this trait is
that when a creature leaves a timeless plane and enters a
plane with another time trait, the effects of hunger, thirst,
aging, and other effects slowed or arrested by the timeless
trait occur retroactively in the instant of transition, possibly
causing the creature to immediately starve or die of old age. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.191), with ID c6e8e2b2-3564-476f-9ddd-e102d992f113 -->

Morphic Traits
This trait describes how easily the physical nature of the plane can be changed. The Universe is considered the norm for its residents, but other planes can warp through the plane’s own sentient designs or be manipulated by extremely powerful creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.198,r=0.471,b=0.295), with ID 7b6d215a-76e9-4d8d-a546-95684ba7bc80 -->

**Normal:** Objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. Creatures can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort, such as by digging a hole. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.296,r=0.471,b=0.356), with ID ef1ef074-fed3-432a-b20b-b8118141ae0e -->

**Metamorphic:** Things change by means other than physical force or magic. Sometimes spells have morphic effects. Other times, the plane’s nature is under the control of a deity or power, or the plane simply changes at random. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.356,r=0.470,b=0.420), with ID 428a299f-ff08-4334-bb9f-43a57e28afe6 -->

**Sentient:** The plane changes based on its own whims.  
**Static:** Visitors can't affect living residents of the plane or objects the denizens carry in any way. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.419,r=0.470,b=0.495), with ID e9ecd016-de37-4d03-b542-06762fa7f08b -->

**Planar Essence Traits**
Planar essence traits describe a plane’s fundamental nature. For example, many of the Inner Sphere’s planes are infused with an element or energy, each of which affects magic on those planes, and the Netherworld is awash with shadow. Outer Planes are fundamentally made up of quintessence, a philosophically aligned material with infinite potential for shape and state that conforms to powerful and prevailing beliefs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.506,r=0.470,b=0.647), with ID 77797a2c-0ae2-484f-88d7-6bb1b143e105 -->

**Air:** Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres, though they might include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Earth creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air planes, as there’s little solid ground for them to gain their bearings, which tends to at least make them uncomfortable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.649,r=0.470,b=0.770), with ID 682b536b-c875-4c8d-89f5-56a7094f3952 -->

**Earth:** These planes are mostly solid. Travelers arriving upon an earth plane risk suffocation if they don’t reach a cavern or some other air pocket within the plane’s solid matter. Creatures who can’t burrow are entombed in the plane’s substance and must attempt to dig their way toward an air pocket. Air creatures are ill at ease, as they rarely have the space to move freely through even the loftiest warrens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.771,r=0.470,b=0.877), with ID cbb0dccd-1058-4304-88df-6b90507d626f -->

**Fire:** Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures. Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.878,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 52fcebca-8da3-4ffe-80ef-13d3d337f711 -->

immediately, and creatures wearing unprotected flammable
clothing catch fire, typically taking 1d6 persistent fire
damage. Extraplanar creatures take moderate environmental
fire damage at the end of each round (sometimes minor
environmental damage in safer areas, or major or massive
damage in even more fiery areas). Ice creatures are extremely
uncomfortable on a fire plane, assuming they don’t outright
melt in the heat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.081,r=0.861,b=0.202), with ID 14b67e6a-ce55-4c45-84da-0f1b53609077 -->

**Metal:** These planes consist of chaotic and shifting structures and oceans of metal. Metal planes tend to exist in a state of change and decay, leaving plentiful pockets of air for visitors to breathe or move within. Creatures unlucky enough to be entombed in the plane’s substance risk suffocation if they can’t phase through metal. Wood creatures find the lack of stability and soil on a metal plane disconcerting and often fail to thrive in such environments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.204,r=0.860,b=0.325), with ID d407513d-519f-4dc4-b49e-1e59a04b256b -->

**Water:** Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach an air pocket likely drown. The rules for aquatic combat (*Player Core* 437) usually apply, including the inability to cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait. Creatures with a weakness to water take damage equal to double their weakness at the end of each round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.326,r=0.861,b=0.432), with ID 26d89daa-ff81-43ec-9ca4-be4d3f925122 -->

**Wood:** These planes consist of trees and other flora latticed in organic patterns. Wood planes are often perfectly constructed to match their desired purpose or environment but aren’t usually outright hostile to visitors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.434,r=0.860,b=0.494), with ID 00568ca1-bb6c-4768-8d5a-986a3200fd4b -->

**Shadow:** Planes with this trait are umbral with murky light. In the Netherworld, the radius of all light from light sources and the areas of light spells are halved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.495,r=0.860,b=0.540), with ID 41caad07-a61d-457e-a80c-ab0dca709f08 -->

Void: Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life from the living. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds carrying the moans of the dead At the end of each round, a living creature takes at least minor void environmental damage. In the strongest areas of a void plane, they could take moderate or even major void damage at the end of each round. This damage has the death trait, and if a living creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this void damage and killed, it crumbles into ash and can become a wraith (see Monster Core). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.541,r=0.860,b=0.693), with ID fc684ea6-1cbd-4b9d-b4f1-18c43b5ea4fc -->

**Vitality:** These planes are awash with life energy. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense. At the end of each round, an undead creature takes at least minor vitality environmental damage. In the strongest areas of a vitality plane, they could take moderate or even major vitality damage instead. While this might seem safe for living creatures, vitality planes present a different danger. Living creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this would bring the living creature above their maximum HP, any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until the creature leaves the plane. If a creature’s temporary HP from a vitality plane ever exceeds its maximum HP, it explodes in a burst of overloaded vitality energy, spreading across the area to birth new souls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.694,r=0.859,b=0.938), with ID fe02ad3a-c16b-440a-b76b-929b1c337d3b -->

Summary : This is a planar cosmology map from Pathfinder, showing the relationships and structure of the multiverse, including the Inner Sphere, Outer Sphere, and overlapping planes, with labeled regions and connections.

map:
# Scope & Reference :
  • Depicts the cosmological structure of the Pathfinder universe.
  • Shows the Inner Sphere, Outer Sphere, and Overlapping Planes.
  • No geographic coordinates; arrangement is conceptual, not spatial.

# Keys & Annotations :
  • Inner Sphere: Contains the Universe, surrounded by elemental planes—Plane of Wood, Plane of Metal, Plane of Air, Plane of Water, Plane of Earth, Plane of Fire.
  • Outer Sphere: Includes labeled regions—Elysium, Nirvana, Heaven, Axis, The Boneyard, Hell, Abaddon, The Maelstrom, The Outer Rifts.
  • Overlapping Planes: Creation’s Forge, Ethereal Plane, The Universe, First World, The Void, The Netherworld.
  • Astral Plane: Shown as a connecting region between Inner and Outer Spheres.
  • Dotted lines indicate connections between spheres and planes.
  • Color coding: Elemental planes use distinct colors (e.g., fire—orange, water—blue, earth—brown).
  • Labels for each region and plane are clearly marked.

# Ordering :
  • Inner Sphere is central, surrounded by elemental planes in concentric rings.
  • Outer Sphere is depicted as a large circle with various realms arranged around its edge.
  • Overlapping Planes are shown as a stack or sequence to the left, with the Universe at the center.
  • Dotted lines visually connect the Inner Sphere, Astral Plane, and Outer Sphere.

# Analysis :
  • The map visually organizes the cosmology into three main structural groups: Inner Sphere (material and elemental), Outer Sphere (afterlife and alignment-based realms), and Overlapping Planes (transitional or boundary realms).
  • The Astral Plane serves as a bridge between the Inner and Outer Spheres.
  • The arrangement emphasizes the centrality of the Universe and the interconnectedness of all planes.
  • The use of color and spatial arrangement helps distinguish the nature and function of each plane or realm. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.008,r=0.996,b=0.534), with ID b78038a8-aedf-4326-ad09-521b5dd5cf14 -->

# PLANAR STAT BLOCKS
Each of the planes listed in the following pages includes a short stat block of key information. The plane’s type—whether it’s a plane, dimension, or demiplane—appears in the stat block’s heading, followed by the traits that define that plane. The following entries also provide important information about each plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.550,r=0.514,b=0.663), with ID a72b4b16-067e-4a6a-b01b-347be7d2ef24 -->

Category: This indicates whether the plane is an Inner Plane, Outer Plane, Transitive Plane, or dimension.  
Divinities: A list of all of the deities, demigods, and other powers that call this realm their home. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.663,r=0.512,b=0.724), with ID 46f340d0-16b5-409f-9169-916e4a6c685e -->

**Native Inhabitants:** A sample of typical inhabitants of the plane. Also listed are the plane’s shades, the souls of dead mortals who have been judged and sent on to whichever plane reflects the life they led. More information on shades can be found in *Monster Core*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.725,r=0.513,b=0.801), with ID c2aa4779-80cc-4ec4-a6a4-705a5e88def1 -->

## Inner Sphere Planes
The planes of the Inner Sphere form the heart of the cosmos. They’re the home of mortal life, the focus of divine attention, the source of mortal souls, and the origin point of the great cycle of quintessence that fuels the motions and stability of reality itself. Arranged in a nested series of shells, like layers of an onion, the planes of the Inner Sphere include, from outer to inner: the elemental planes of fire, earth, metal, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.813,r=0.512,b=0.940), with ID cafa813d-3973-4246-afcc-9d24c85c3e3b -->

water, wood, and air; the mortal galaxies of the Universe;  
and at the very core of this cosmological ensemble, the raw  
forces of creation and destruction of Creation’s Forge and  
the Void overlap the Universe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.557,r=0.904,b=0.618), with ID 3aceb26c-39e9-4b88-868f-671391dc5fa1 -->

THE UNIVERSE        PLANE

Category: Inner Plane
Divinities: Dominion of the Black, Gozreh
Native Inhabitants: dwarves, elves, halflings, humans, gnomes, goblins, and countless other ancestries <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.629,r=0.904,b=0.707), with ID 3d8cb624-d6f6-47ca-8fbc-6f30ba1ec9f9 -->

The Universe is the prosaic realm and the home of mortal life. Innumerable galaxies play host to countless stars and their planets, each housing unique settings for any campaign, with Golarion as the classic example. Other worlds of note like Castrovel, Akiton, Triaxus, and Eox exist within Golarion's own solar system, and then beyond this, orbiting other distant stars or in other galaxies still, worlds such as Androffa and even Earth swirl within the Universe's vast and silent void. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.709,r=0.903,b=0.831), with ID 8bdb0e50-a3d6-4fbf-a84a-3dea88fb49c4 -->

Yet, for all the profound wonder and diversity of life that the Universe houses, in the dark places between the stars known as the Dark Tapestry, lurk the sinister collective of gods called the Dominion of the Black. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.833,r=0.903,b=0.892), with ID 57a82372-a615-43da-9266-df7ccecdcb22 -->

The Universe serves as the destination for pre-incarnate souls,
each mortal life born, living, and dying before sending its spirit
toward the planes of the Outer Sphere for judgment. The Universe <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.894,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 187c9dd9-4a25-48b3-aa0c-8f4226a5a0ba -->

CREATION'S FORGE                                            PLANE

SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY   UNBOUNDED   VITALITY
Category Inner Plane
Divinities none
Native Inhabitants jyotis, shades (enlightened)
Creation's Forge is at once the source of life-sustaining vitality energy, the origin of all pre-incarnate mortal souls, and paradoxically the most innately hostile of all of the planes. While vitality energy is deadly to undead and beneficial to living beings, such is the intensity of the plane that unmitigated exposure ultimately incinerates any extraplanar beings without sufficient magical protection. The most apt comparison for the plane's interior is that of the heart of a burning star. Indeed, the stars of the Universe each house natural portals to Creation's Forge within their glowing, potent cores to foster the movement of pre-incarnate souls in their first steps in the great cycle of life and death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.137,r=0.471,b=0.401), with ID e2d04098-109b-4695-8eac-b406e6b13190 -->

Brilliant and blinding, the plane’s interior is sparsely populated, and the resident phoenix-kin jyotis are intensely xenophobic. Dwelling in glimmering, radiant crystalline cities such as Arudrellisiir, they view themselves as gardeners and guardians of souls spawned from their realm’s burning quintessence. Intensely distrustful of gods and their servitors, jyotis can nonetheless be bargained with, and they’ve frequently taken into their custodianship any number of artifacts and imprisoned beings considered too dangerous to house on any other plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.402,r=0.471,b=0.541), with ID d6a8aaee-1670-4187-aaed-e920fd4baf59 -->

THE VOID

PLANE

SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY   UNBOUNDED   VOID
Category Inner Plane
Divinities none
Native Inhabitants secudainars, wraiths, and other undead
The vast nothingness of the Void is a merciless, lightless expanse of manifest destruction and nihilism. Sapping and consuming the life force of any living creature exposed to its energies, it corrodes and disintegrates material objects to rubble, then dust, and then nothing at all, yet the Void contains its own form of anti-life. At their densest concentration, the plane’s energies aggregate into bizarre, black crystalline snowflake structures. These irregularities spontaneously generate the plane’s resident secudainars. Dwelling in beautiful, deadly cities drifting in the vacuous darkness, these so-called void raptors are incapable of true creation and blame this flaw on some ancient betrayal by their rivals in Creation’s Forge. Secudainars react violently not only toward creatures sustained by vitality energy, but also toward undead, whom they view as unnatural parasites unworthy of their plane’s energies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.551,r=0.470,b=0.861), with ID 9ad64dc8-219d-4d1f-a176-6bca8a59dc20 -->

The black depths swarm with undead, creatures doomed
to a mockery of life by the interaction of their souls with the
plane’s entropic energy. For all the horrors posed by the Void’s
environment, inhabitants, and undead victims, its depths
nevertheless hide rare refuges for planar travelers. Malikar’s Keep <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.862,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID 3b10117f-bb42-46da-a479-c2cdaf658538 -->

ENHANCED AND IMPEDED MAGIC
Some particularly potent areas can enhance magic related to the nature of the plane or impede magic inimical to it. For instance, a nexus of void energy in the Void might enhance void magic, and the unholy majesty of an archdevil’s throne room might impede holy magic.
  Enhanced Magic: Anyone Casting a Spell with the enhanced trait gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their spell DC or spell attack roll with that spell.
  Impeded Magic: A character who Casts a Spell or activates an item with the specified trait must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or the spell or activation is disrupted <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.074,r=0.861,b=0.294), with ID d162e223-fcb8-4405-b098-e72762f739a0 -->

Elsewhere, the depths hide entire lost worlds, such as Fallen Duromak, and deadly mysteries like the planet-sized, undead-entrapping glass sphere, Eternity’s Doorstep. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.308,r=0.861,b=0.374), with ID 54ce3ddc-f917-4b85-a6f8-6f0f304d2880 -->

The Plane of Air, innermost of the Elemental Planes, is a vast realm of wind, storms, and skies. Illuminated by great artificial globes of flame and distant starlight from the material universe, the plane is populated by air elementals, dragons, air scamps, and a great empire of jaathoom genies. Though mostly clouds and empty skies, the plane isn’t entirely bereft of solid ground, including rock and ice created by the residents or dragged into their realm from the distant Plane of Earth or neighboring Plane of Water. The returning pockets of the Plane of Wood have let loose giant pieces of driftwood into the plane as well. Bizarre, drifting spheres of brass and iron make for the most convenient navigational aids; the former housing the cities of the vast Jaathoom Empire, the latter almost entirely abandoned and shunned by the plane’s inhabitants, who believe them cursed, entrapping forgotten, ancient enemies who once ravaged the plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.478,r=0.860,b=0.708), with ID 84898d26-827f-4b13-a896-56a0b0b4192e -->

The jaathooms rule from their shining capital city of Armun Kelisk, built atop a series of seven floating islands. Their vast trade network crisscrosses the skies and ventures to other planes, kept aloft by natural and magical flight, including great airships that allow visitors to quickly and safely traverse the skies. The jaathooms are welcoming and gracious hosts to extraplanar travelers and adventurers, a perspective not shared by Hshurha the Duchess of All Winds, one of the elemental lords of air. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.709,r=0.860,b=0.832), with ID 228a315c-6284-4b61-8df5-b4da961f5d2e -->

A great and rocky shell situated between the Plane of Fire and Plane of Water, the Eternal Delve hosts a unique and varied ecology of creatures at home in its rocky depths. Far from an endless, solid expanse, the Plane of Earth is riddled with great caverns and cave systems, excavated artificial vaults, vast crystalline geodes, and underground oceans and springs of magma where it borders its neighboring planes. Housing untold riches in gemstones and veins of precious metals, the Plane of Earth is an attractive setting for planar travelers seeking wealth and willing to risk danger and the wrath of elementals, jabalis, and other inhabitants who resent the plunder of their home. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.077,r=0.515,b=0.248), with ID 501af5ad-4677-467d-95e6-10c03545b5f2 -->

While elementals have little organized society, the jabali
genies’ Peerless Empire rules much of the plane from its capital,
the Opaline Vault—a rainbow-lit city within a 30-mile-wide geode
cavern. They brook little dissent, and their rule can be harsh.
They’re downright welcoming, however, compared to Ayrzul
the Fossilized King, the hated elemental lord of earth who rules
a great expanse of rock from his radiation-poisoned domain, the
Blistering Labyrinth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.249,r=0.515,b=0.373), with ID 657fd4ee-813e-4402-994e-6191878fcca3 -->

Like a great, gleaming ball of flame situated at the heart of the Astral Plane, the Plane of Fire is the outermost plane of the Inner Sphere. A perpetual ocean of fire with skies of smoke, storms of raining cinders, and lakes and rivers of magma flowing along its border with the Elemental Plane of Earth, the plane is incredibly hostile to those unprepared for its natural hazards. Yet, it houses one of the most well-known and traversed cities in all the planes: Medina Mudi'ia, capital of the Dominion of Flame. Floating above a sea of fire upon a great hemisphere of magical brass, Medina Mudi'ia is a monument both to ifrits’ cosmopolitan grandeur and tyranny, the latter embodied by the grand sultana of the ifrits. Outside of the mercantile districts and the palaces and temples of the fire genies, the city houses a vast oppressed underclass, including creatures from other planes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.479,r=0.514,b=0.693), with ID c484e242-a753-4c7c-a0d1-9ade6a9c9fc3 -->

The ifrit domain isn’t absolute, and elsewhere in the plane are
nations of fire scamps and the remains of an ancient munsahir
empire. While they don’t form any cohesive, organized nations,
the plane’s fire elementals are ruled over by the plane’s most
powerful entity, Ymeri the Queen of the Inferno, the warlike
elemental lord of fire whose reign has gone unquestioned since
the imprisonment of her rival Atreia eons ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.694,r=0.513,b=0.801), with ID b0cf4f3f-353a-42c5-8aae-7b4803496a84 -->

it wedges between the Plane of Earth and Plane of Water, vast in
scope but still expanding. Metal of every kind (liquid and solid),
decaying cityscapes, and intense magnetic fields make up the
chaotic structure of the plane. Creatures reflect the jumble of
forces that make their home. Many have fluid forms of flowing
metal or inhabit clouds of rust. The genies of the plane, zuhras,
put on bold performances keyed into the plane's dissonance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.188), with ID 1b89cfb5-e666-47c7-9bcf-6b3fb30bb16b -->

The elemental lords of metal embody the slow disintegration
of their home. After an invasion by forces from the Plane of
Earth before their plane was sealed off, the lords were dispirited
and offered no clear vision for what their plane could be in the
absence of the other planes of the Inner Sphere. Laudinmio, the
Sovereign of Alchemy, remains in slumber, while Ferrumnestra,
the Lady of Rust, treads under the weight of deep despair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.189,r=0.903,b=0.296), with ID fd13418f-3baf-481e-bc10-b73a18e97907 -->

Beyond the skies of the Plane of Air, the roots of the newly regrown Plane of Wood are nurtured by the vast, spherical, liquid shell of the Plane of Water. Its nearly limitless stretches of saline, fresh, and brackish seas teem with all manner of oceanic life, lit by submerged suns and bioluminescence before descending into the black, benthic depths where the plane borders the Plane of Earth. While it’s perfectly amenable to water-breathing creatures, air-breathing travelers must provide their own supply of air or magical means to breathe while on the plane. Bubbles of breathable atmosphere are relatively rare and securely guarded, anchored over places of trade and commerce with outsiders, such as the great city of Vialesk, founded by immigrant undines. The plane’s oceans, dotted by vast forests of kelp, magical currents, and strange phenomena, play host to empires of merfolk, predatory and expansionist sea devils, and the holdings of the plane’s great brine dragons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.402,r=0.903,b=0.646), with ID 3e9858c7-59b0-4c6f-8828-343dcdd00daf -->

While faydhaans once claimed nearly absolute dominion
over the plane of their origin, their empire long ago fell into
deterioration and disunity. Their ravaged cities sank into the
depths, and their present-day holdings remain a shadow of their
former grandeur. Kelizandri the Brackish Emperor, the prideful
elemental lord of water and cause of the genies’ ruin, rules the
dark, saline depths, feasting on all rivals and hoarding the vast,
stolen wealth of the fallen faydhaan cities—but the return of his
counterpart Lysianassa, Empress of the Torrent, now threatens
his hold on the plane. Unlike other subjective gravity planes, on
the Plane of Water, a creature moves based on its swim Speed
and must use actions to Swim if it doesn’t have one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.649,r=0.903,b=0.831), with ID ee20953d-dd5d-4d3c-891b-913dea0cecd6 -->

The Plane of Wood recently returned to the planar cosmology after an absence of eons. Still rebuilding to its ancient splendor, it climbs between the Plane of Water and Plane of Air. Fractal tree growth, eternally tended and shaped by the plane’s inhabitants, stretches across the plane with dizzying symmetry. Creatures either enforce and augment this ordered growth or exist as a byproduct thereof. Some drop from the trees as discarded seeds given fresh life, while others chisel or cultivate creatures’ natural beauty to suit their aesthetic tastes. The genies of the plane, kizidhars, are artisans in this field. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.077,r=0.472,b=0.234), with ID 5f918a2b-7834-457b-a37b-aff28d47fb84 -->

The elemental lords of wood embody the often-paradoxical rigidity and pliancy of their element. When other planes of the Inner Sphere came under threat, the lords acted swiftly to seal off their home, protecting the plane and its residents—yet even in this, they're said to have disagreed, and the two haven't spoken in millennia. Shumunue, the Carved Lady of Mimicry, desperately searches for a cure for her great ailment, while Verilorn, Custodian of Oak and Ash, worries that ending the plane's long isolation will lead to its ruin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.234,r=0.472,b=0.372), with ID 2d213635-d28f-4b3a-8b13-ea626d63afc9 -->

Transitive Planes
At a minimum, each Transitive Plane coexists with one or
more other planes, a relationship oversimplified by stating
that Transitive Planes are just used to get from one plane to
another. The mists of the Ethereal Plane overlap the planes
of the Inner Sphere, while the Astral Plane borders every
other plane in existence like the backstage of the cosmos.
Bright and dark mirrors of the Universe, the First World
and the Netherworld overlap the mortal world, albeit often
in bizarre ways such that a short distance in one might be
a vast gulf in the other. The daring, wise, or desperate can
utilize these planes to bypass barriers in the Universe or
rapidly cross vast distances through much swifter travel. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.382,r=0.472,b=0.588), with ID 013cb791-4713-443e-9cb8-ac085840cd43 -->

The Silver Sea surrounds the planes of the Inner Sphere, separating them from those of the Outer Sphere. The Astral Plane provides the backdrop against which the River of Souls flows from the Universe, ushering departed spirits toward the Boneyard for final judgment. Far from an empty void, the Astral's silver substance churns with currents and storms from the metaphysical heat of the Plane of Fire, and where it touches the chaos of the Maelstrom, the resulting eddies interact with the memories of the dead to produce fleeting simulacra and even demiplanes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.596,r=0.472,b=0.816), with ID ec48ccdf-c039-449d-b25b-6bb0178823ac -->

The River of Souls draws the attention of soul-hunting daemons and opportunistic night hags like sharks drawn to the scent of blood. Led by psychopomps, a cross section of nearly every type of celestial and monitor in existence, along with some fiends, defends the proper flow of souls against such predators. Running opposite the River of Souls is the flow of raw quintessence spun off from the so-called Antipode, channeled by aeons back toward the Creation's Forge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.816,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 30c16c83-3bbb-43f1-b52f-deb24ad314fb -->

Travelers within the Astral find the plane untouched by the passage of time, a property exploited by many mortals fearing old age.

Formed by the interacting tidal forces of creation and destruction from Creation’s Forge and the Void, this plane swirls with currents and eddies of fog, lit only by erratic pulses of soft green luminescence and dim light of those planes it overlays, visible but ever intangible. While mortals most often use the Ethereal Plane as a means of transit, moving by force of will in the absence of gravity to bypass barriers on their own plane, the Ethereal hosts dangers and wonders, things lost or abandoned in the mists, and things spun from local eddies in the ethereal protomatter. Predatory monsters, ether spiders, hags and their goddess Alazhra, and all manner of incorporeal undead roam the Space Between Spaces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.168,r=0.862,b=0.447), with ID f0d6ef2e-2ec2-4844-81d1-6271f23628fa -->

While travelers can easily become lost in the mists with little to guide them, the plane does host some permanent structures, drawing adventurers or dissuading them. One such location, the House of the Itinerant Soul, houses wayward or lost souls, offering visitors shelter and a way to avoid turning into undead while avoiding the pull of the River of Souls. The grand cathedral also serves as a focus for mortal planar travelers, given its safety and the presence of friendly spirits willing to serve as guides in the surrounding mists. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.449,r=0.862,b=0.587), with ID 0c70d63e-f857-46bc-9b33-82798180651a -->

The First World was a first draft of the Universe, crafted by divinities to test their metaphorical materials and palettes of colors before setting it aside to create a second, final version of their work. A realm of extremes—bestial, primal, and beautiful—with colors and sensations brighter and more intense than the mundane world created after it, the First World is populated by fey and the divine entities known as the Eldest. Mirroring mercurial fey whimsy, the First World's laws of nature constantly and unpredictably change. Distance and time are wildly inconsistent, such that mortal travelers might spend an hour or a day within the First World, only to find a century or only a few seconds passed once they return to their own plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.598,r=0.861,b=0.861), with ID f1cb57e0-68ca-46e8-b6e9-52d98491a43f -->

A murky, distorted, and imperfect mirror of the Universe, the Netherworld overlaps the Universe and serves as a buffer or conduit between it and the Void. The Netherworld exists in a state of perpetually dim half-light, the landscape containing similar features to the overlapping Universe, but in warped or twisted fashions. Cities in the Universe might exist in the Netherworld, sometimes in ruins and sometimes as terrible, frightening replicas.

# Outer Sphere Planes
The planes of the Outer Sphere are the manifest realms of philosophy: good and evil, order and change, faith, and their admixtures, populated by celestials, fiends, monitors, and others who promote these moral concepts. These planes are the backdrop upon which the mortal afterlife reaches its apparent conclusion, and the end destination of the River of Souls. The Outer Planes are regions of stability adrift in the raw, chaotic quintessence of the primordial Maelstrom, its tides forever gnawing at their edges even as mortal souls sustain them. The Outer Rifts manifest as cracks in the Outer Sphere’s fabric.

A perpetual eclipse looms above the bleak wastelands of Abaddon, shedding an eerie half-light over a landscape of toxic, disease-ridden swamps, volcanic wastes, fog-shrouded forests, and the glittering, memory-devouring ribbon of the River Styx. An unnatural silence blankets the plane, cut only by the wails of shades falling from the sky like screaming, falling stars, or those already condemned upon the ground, desperate to find safety that doesn’t exist. Daemons, the physical embodiments of meaningless death and oblivion, roam unchecked, owing allegiance only to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War. In the courts of the Horsemen and the neutral grounds of trade cities such as Awaiting-Consumption, the soul trade serves daemonic hunger and industrialized extinction. Hags and other creatures ply this trade or make their way along the margins of daemonic society, eager to avoid consumption themselves by the plane’s nihilistic masters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.120,r=0.471,b=0.447), with ID 88df59ed-b15e-44a8-abac-4850b2de336b -->

Axis is a realm of pure, absolute order, unhindered by moral concerns. The plane takes the form of a vast, gleaming, perfectly structured city. Built at the base of Pharasma’s Spire, the Perfect City is a bulwark against the chaos of the Maelstrom and the Outer Rifts, with vast mechanical armies marching forth to explore, define, and pacify an imperfect, unruly universe. Axis is also home to axiomites: beings composed of living mathematics and equations. Axiomites continue to work on their organization of the cosmos but increasingly turn their attentions to the planar city of Axis itself; as with any city, Axis requires nonstop maintenance and improvement in order to resist the march of time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.634,r=0.470,b=0.830), with ID 87841e5f-ca8c-45cc-b8cb-e6655718738f -->

Axis’s natives are far from the only inhabitants of their cosmopolitan realm. Devils and archons often visit along with shades, mortal travelers, and smaller numbers of most every other kind of extraplanar being. Abadar and other deities make their homes in the realm. The empty, former domain of Aroden languishes here, while below the streets lies Norgorber’s domain, a labyrinthine undercity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.832,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID dcaa4bc2-d4e1-4459-a010-431529754677 -->

BONEYARD PLANE

TIMELESS
Category Outer Plane
Divinities Achaekek, Groetus, psychopomp ushers, Pharasma
Native Inhabitants shades (the dead), psychopomps
The Boneyard spans an impossibly tall and ever-growing spire of gleaming quintessence that rises up into the silver void of the Astral Plane. As the destination of the River of Souls, the Boneyard is where the souls of the mortal dead arrive for judgment and for Pharasma and her psychopomp servitors to direct them to their respective afterlives. Pharasma’s domain is separated into eight courts, each corresponding to one of the other planes of the Outer Sphere and collecting the souls due to that plane. Not every soul goes unchallenged, and proxies of gods and planes argue and debate over souls, with final arbitration conducted by Pharasma herself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.076,r=0.860,b=0.325), with ID 0aa57588-58ad-481d-9087-b8ea5d286eb9 -->

While Pharasma rules absolutely within the Boneyard, she isn’t the only divinity there. The demigod psychopomp ushers dwell within the plane in service to her, and the deity Achaekek dwells below at the spire’s root. Looming high above as a skull-faced moon waits Groetus, the god of the end times, his orbit slowly decaying in minuscule iterations supposedly counting down to the last days of the cosmos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.326,r=0.861,b=0.433), with ID b8db8bf6-723b-4b1f-87f2-bc2a52f8c362 -->

Pharasma’s courts and the surrounding Graveyard of Souls are not the only features atop the spire. Beyond the graveyard, the Spirelands manifest environments much like those of the varied worlds of the Universe, filled with the souls of neutral shades who have nowhere else to go as they are unclaimed by any gods and did nothing in life to suggest any particular ethos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.434,r=0.860,b=0.526), with ID bb1d9095-5052-4d97-a2b9-1d0c54502a1d -->

Native Inhabitants azatas, shades (the chosen)
Verdant, wild, and unrestrained by order, where passion and creation are fostered and rewarded, the plane of Elysium is a place of wild, idealized natural beauty. The so-called Promised Land and its inhabitants represent a wide variety of freely given benevolence, often willing to directly aid visitors but more often serving as inspirations and muses to foster positive change and self-realized success. Elysium’s shades, known as the chosen, appear as idealized versions of their mortal selves, each pursuing their own self-determined actions and finding their unique paths to join the ranks of the plane’s celestials. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.618,r=0.860,b=0.800), with ID 23ad565e-df1c-479a-a446-afb4b3ca3297 -->

Azatas—the plane’s primary denizens–organize into fleeting, competitive courts, each rewarding heroism and creativity above all else. Elysium hosts a number of resident deities, including Calistria and the elven pantheon, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Gorum, and various empyreal lords. Visitors from across the planes are drawn to Elysium’s Wandering City of Emerald Song, a mobile, impermanent, and ever-changing city of azatas organized by their princess, Anduarine the Muse, filled with art, craft, revelry, song, and trade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.802,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 34b90ef3-05c5-49a3-afc7-499f4ee88f16 -->

HEAVEN                PLANE
Category Outer Plane
Divinities dwarven pantheon, Easivra, empyreal lords, Erastil, Iomedae, Shizuru, Torag, Tsukiyo
Native Inhabitants archons, shades (the elect)
The great mountain of Heaven is the realm of structured benevolence made manifest. Organized into seven tiers, the mountain’s solid appearance is actually malleable, making way for a vast assemblage of varied environments to accommodate both its own celestials and the souls who migrate there. Devoted to defending the innocent and crusading against the wicked, Heaven’s archons marshal into vast armies, commanded by their empyreal lords. Angels collaborate with the archon legions but typically act in more direct service to Heaven’s resident deities, with Iomedae, Erastil, and Torag the most prominent among them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.072,r=0.515,b=0.325), with ID 6d7960e1-306e-4611-9e6d-a6f2c20ea56c -->

Shades known as the elect manifest at the mountain’s base, and their subsequent climb up the seemingly endless, unreachable heights is both a literal and figurative journey. Progress is about personal growth and spiritual purification as the shades grow more and more attuned to the plane. Likewise, progress from one layer to the next is often impossible without permission from the archons or spiritual alignment with Heaven itself. Most visitors arrive at the city of Heaven’s Shore, a place open to both traders and to pilgrims of good intent. Access beyond its heavily guarded walls is difficult, to say nothing of scaling the mountain. At its pinnacle is the Garden, Heaven’s ultimate layer. Unattended and empty, the Garden is a beautiful, transcendent mystery even to its resident deities and the source of the plane’s call of self-perfection to its shades. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.327,r=0.515,b=0.556), with ID 07ce8360-15a7-4531-9856-184ac0a6923f -->

Native Inhabitants devils, hellhounds, shades (the damned)
Hell is the realm of devils, the multiversal seat of tyranny and malignant laws, and the divine domain of Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Here, every act is authorized, calculated, recorded, and set like perfectly ordered clockwork within a vast machine driven on methodical suffering and greased with pain and purification. The nine inverted layers of Hell violently oppose the surrounding fabric of the Maelstrom, each layer shaped to reflect the nature of its ruling archdevil. Avernus’s volcanic wastes, ruled by Barbatos, are the marshaling place of Hell’s armies and where newly damned souls are shackled and shuffled off to their assigned torment. Dispater’s layer of Dis is a great iron city: brutal, beautiful, and terrible. The layer of Erebus is comprised of both the sewers of Dis and the vaults and treasuries of Hell, ruled by Mammon, a great genius loci embodied by the very wealth locked within Hell’s coffers. Ruled by Belial, the layer of Phlegethon hosts Hell’s forges, while Geryon’s watery realm of Stygia houses Hell’s libraries.

the training site of the infernal armies, and Baalzebul’s frozen
layer of Cocytus torments the imprisoned, starving damned.
Mephistopheles rules the layer of Caina, a realm of cages and

Native Inhabitants proteans, shades (the shapeless)
The Maelstrom, infinite and ancient, spawned the other Outer Planes in cosmological prehistory and surrounds them like a vast metaphorical—and at times literal—ocean of raw, seething quintessence. Where the Maelstrom borders these other planes, its structure takes on their characteristics, albeit in an unpredictable, chaotic fashion. Beyond these so-called Borderlands, however, the Maelstrom reverts to its true nature, the Cerulean Void: a trackless, liquid infinity devoid of stability and permanence where serpentine proteans create and destroy with profound frivolity. The proteans are paradoxically organized into discrete choruses, each with its own philosophy and goals in service to the Maelstrom. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.281,r=0.905,b=0.478), with ID 5cd32989-4698-4a38-aa24-da85c4af80da -->

Swirling with oddities and wild magic, bereft of laws and
structure, the Maelstrom also serves as a conduit between the
other Outer Planes utilized by armies of extraplanar beings,
hordes of demons spilling forth from the Outer Rifts, and the
innumerable protean choruses seeking to return the rest of
the planes to the true freedom of the chaos from which they
emerged. Sufficiently powerful magic can stabilize the chaos
for a time, allowing for the creation of demiplanes and stable
islands. The massive planar trade city of Galisemni is most
prominent among them, drifting through the chaos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.480,r=0.904,b=0.633), with ID 9c26493f-9e4b-4dbc-a2a1-cb06935d28e4 -->

The pastoral paradise of Nirvana is the realm of purest benevolence, a plane that promises sanctuary to the weary and enlightenment and transcendence to those who seek it out. Filled with beautiful wilderness of all types in perfect harmony with its occupants, Nirvana’s wilds are home to angels and others. The plane’s shades, known as the cleansed, most often take the forms of glorified, sapient wild animals, though many eventually leave their carefree existence to aid others, ascending to assist the benevolent works of angels. Devoted to guiding and assisting mortals, angels are often charged with delivering important messages that reflect the will of benevolent deities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.725,r=0.904,b=0.907), with ID 0cbb08e8-71ff-4a95-bdb2-247e49efbcd8 -->

Sarenrae and Shelyn. While the great cities of High Ninshabur and Llourith welcome visitors, most mortals visiting Nirvana witness the plane’s beauty and supernatural feeling of peace but rarely encounter many of its residents, as the plane protectively hides much of its contents from any but the most selfless and pure of heart. The plane’s hinterlands hint at hidden mysteries, including legends that the plane shelters the vanished heroes of innumerable mortal worlds, peacefully sleeping until their peoples’ times of greatest need. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.220), with ID 7e2b716e-c2c8-4e61-8fbd-76ee053eb5be -->

Native Inhabitants demons, shades (larvae), qlippoth
Like a corrosive rot in the roots of the Outer Sphere, or an antithetical, rival reality run aground into the Maelstrom at the dawn of time, the Outer Rifts is a place of horror and destruction fed by mortal sin. Each of its innumerable regions is a unique iteration of chaos and malice, each with its own terrible and twisted environment, with one driving maxim: the strong survive, while the weak suffer and are destroyed. Ruled by demons, and before them by the alien, nightmarish qlippoth, the Outer Rifts and its native beings seek only to ruin and destroy. Though demons routinely rampage out into other planes when the Outer Rifts manifests a great planar rift, the denizens of the Outer Rifts are fractured and self-destructive. Demon lords such as Dagon, Pazuzu, and Zura, and even gods including the ascended demon lord Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters, fight for dominion over the Outer Rifts as much or more than they threaten the other planes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.311,r=0.471,b=0.570), with ID b1a186af-5568-4d84-84a0-6aec020f15d6 -->

Though dangerous, not every realm of the Outer Rifts is immediately hostile to the prepared traveler. Shamira’s city of Alushinyrra in the Midnight Isles and Abraxas’s library-city of Diovengia in the realm of Pleroma are each welcoming in their own dark ways. Even those who survive a journey through the Outer Rifts, however, inevitably must resist being deeply corrupted by the experience. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.571,r=0.471,b=0.679), with ID e7fa96ce-8a77-4565-8e51-e810835321c1 -->

Dimensions  
Existing in the metaphorical space between the Transitive Planes and smaller, finite demiplanes, dimensions are a category unto themselves, defying the neat categorization of planar scholars and adventurers. Seemingly infinite in scale, not necessarily spatial in the same way as a plane, and overlaying every other plane at once—including one another—dimensions and planes are most significantly differentiated in how each of them breaks the commonly held rules of the other. Although some scholars include other extraplanar realms within the ranks of dimensions, only two such realms are uniformly agreed upon and classified as such. The Dreamlands are readily accessed by mortal dreamers, while the Dimension of Time is notorious for the near impossibility of accessing it as well as the bizarre, often deadly restrictions upon travel to and within its bounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.690,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 3cc3f114-488d-41d1-be33-4461f2463f5b -->

DIMENSION OF TIME                DIMENSION

ERRATIC  STATIC
Category dimension
Divinities unknown
Native Inhabitants shades (the unbound)
Among the most obscure planes of existence, the Dimension of Time is virtually impossible to access by conventional methods of planar travel. Instead, travelers must perform complex and difficult rituals described within the pages of monstrously rare tomes. Compounding the plane’s obscurity, each traveler’s experience seems to be unique, and most who attempt the journey never return. Every manner of magic that interacts with the plane invariably draws the attention of creatures native to the dimension. The proper flow and continuity of time seems to self-correct for any attempted meddling, often with violence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.076,r=0.861,b=0.311), with ID 1216d4af-36a1-4466-a95b-4b8c8891b6ed -->

Those few who have gained entry and returned describe
the plane as a swirling storm of blurred images, the composite
of millions of interwoven timelines around their own, with a
single doorway allowing access to one's own past. Travelers
appear as transparent images of themselves, but the plane
seems averse to any attempt to alter the past, no matter
the means or the intention. Such attempts often end in the
offending individual erased from existence or trapped within
closed time loops to limit the damage they inflict upon the
overall flow of time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.311,r=0.862,b=0.463), with ID 3adfc084-a04e-4c0a-b0e7-7842cac1b0c8 -->

Supposedly, like an eye in a storm, at the dimension’s heart is a legendary realm.

**Native Inhabitants** animate dreams, shades (dreamers)  
Created and sustained by the collective dreams of sleeping mortals, the Dreamlands (also called the Dimension of Dreams) overlays the Ethereal Plane. When a creature dreams, regardless of the location of their physical body, they interact directly with the Dreamlands. Sleeping creatures cast themselves into the plane in idealized avatars known as lucid bodies, and their dreamscapes are immune to outside entry by standard magic, such as *interplanar teleport*, requiring obscure, more specialized spells to access. The dreamers of each mortal world generate a cluster of dreamscapes, like drifting bubbles atop a deeper ocean of permanent dreams formed from the collective mass of slumbering desires, dreams of especially powerful dreamers, and the dreams of ancient, obscure entities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.603,r=0.861,b=0.816), with ID e763ee3e-651a-4ff3-ae17-828662cde399 -->

While most dreamscapes are safe, travelers in the deep, permanent Dreamlands face living, animate dreams and the predation of hags from the Ethereal Plane as well as stranger beings spawned within the core itself. Some scholars postulate a distinct region within the dimension for nightmares, much as the more stable inner portions of the dimension exist separately from the transient, ever-forming and evaporating mortal dreamscapes at its edges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.816,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 81b1a41b-92cc-41cd-8ae3-380dfca49383 -->

  • The ship’s sails are red and white, partially torn, and the vessel is equipped with a front propeller and side-mounted mechanical elements.
  • The background features dramatic clouds, distant mountains, and multiple fiery projectiles streaking through the sky.
  • An explosion is occurring at the bottom right of the ship, with debris and fire bursting outward.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm oranges, reds, and browns, with contrasting cool purples and blues in the sky and mountains.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • No visible text or user interface elements, except for some small, stylized markings near the ship’s bow.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with strong highlights and shadows emphasizing the action and destruction.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The ship is angled upward, occupying the lower and central portions of the image, with the bow in the foreground and the stern receding into the background.
  • The attacking armored figure is airborne, descending from above toward the central defender.
  • The pilot is positioned at the rear, gripping the ship’s wheel.
  • Explosions and debris are concentrated on the lower right, suggesting the ship is under heavy attack from below.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of high-stakes action and peril, with the ship sustaining visible damage and its crew under direct assault.
  • The composition uses diagonal lines and dynamic poses to heighten the sense of movement and chaos.
  • The contrast between the warm explosion and the cool background draws attention to the ship’s imminent danger. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.001,r=0.999,b=0.999), with ID 1f7e0090-7b57-4b45-87f9-d515cc53b5ff -->

# CHAPTER 4:
## SUBSYSTEMS

*When your game goes into uncharted territory or you want to emphasize an element of gameplay that usually gets overlooked or condensed into a single check, you can use a subsystem. As the name implies, subsystems are extensions of the main rules system that allow you to explore a particular topic or style of play at your table.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.071,r=0.867,b=0.202), with ID d129325d-0417-46ef-a23f-f6f9335375ed -->

Subsystems are a great way to add depth to aspects of your game that don’t occur in combat but still have high stakes. This chapter begins with Victory Points, a structure that underlies much of the chapter, to help you build your own subsystems. Next are some of the most common subsystems you might need in your game, with advice on how to use and modify them. This chapter is organized into the following sections. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.232,r=0.473,b=0.356), with ID 8fa91744-6bd5-4eaa-8d12-59f33b78198a -->

- • Victory Points (page 184) provides a framework with which to build your own subsystems, detailing the fundamental structure that Pathfinder uses for its subsystems.
- • Influence (page 187) gives rules for more in-depth social encounters involving influencing NPCs.
- • Research (page 190) shows you how to build an interesting structure for scenes where PCs research topics and seek information.
- • Chases (page 192) are designed to represent the fast-paced feel of movie chase scenes.
- • Infiltration (page 196) allows you to build infiltrations and heists where careful planning helps the PCs maintain an edge against their adversaries and pull off incredible capers.
- • Reputation (page 200) breathes life into the world around the PCs, as various groups of NPCs react favorably or unfavorably to the PCs’ actions, and the PCs’ status with those groups changes.
- • Duels (page 202) provides a simple architecture for one-on-one showdowns between adversaries.
- • Leadership (page 204) allows PCs to attract people to a cause, giving them cohorts and organizations to look after.
- • Hexploration (page 206) teaches you how to build exploration maps on a hexagonal grid to give your PCs the thrill of discovering secrets within uncharted or unfamiliar territory.
- • Vehicles (page 210) allows you to run encounters involving vehicles and capitalize on their potential to help PCs explore on a larger scale and at a faster pace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.356,r=0.475,b=0.836), with ID 56d7d814-37d5-4542-a2d1-291d1dd4b79c -->

## DECIDING TO USE A SUBSYSTEM
When you have an exciting subsystem available, it can be tempting to use it anytime it can possibly come up (for instance, replacing every social scene with the influence subsystem). However, subsystems are most effective <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.842,r=0.474,b=0.943), with ID 9ffceb81-353d-42c0-a6af-873d9be5631a -->

COMBINING SUBSYSTEMS

Some of the subsystems in this chapter could interact in interesting ways when combined. For instance, the influence subsystem could be part of how you build up reputation, or a piece of the plan in an infiltration. Or you could have a hexploration chase with a rival adventuring group, encountering obstacles in each hex as you race for the prize—while using vehicles to travel faster! Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide how two combined subsystems should interact to tell your group’s particular story, though it’s generally good to have a backdrop subsystem that you’re tracking on a longer term to which the shorter-term subsystem contributes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.228,r=0.862,b=0.462), with ID 53a74531-b0cb-4a32-9d9d-cc0349afbe4d -->

when used with intention. They’re best when used for
a component of the game that’s meant to be at least a
significant portion of a single session, when you want
a different style of play than normal. You should avoid
using a particular subsystem if many members of your
group don’t like it, or if use of a subsystem during play
devolves into the PCs making a series of rolls that don’t
contribute to telling an interesting story. You should also
be careful to ensure that whatever subsystem you use
doesn’t predominantly favor a specific player character or
class, since this can result in one person dominating the
scene while the other players have nothing useful to do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.477,r=0.863,b=0.663), with ID 52e3a84a-b3f1-4989-be86-fb7c14e192fa -->

It’s important to leave enough time and mental energy
to make the subsystem feel special and to bring all the
components and elements of the subsystem to life in
the game world. Subsystems often require strategic
thinking for players to succeed, but also require
roleplaying to glue together in a satisfying way. When
presented with a specific structure on how to complete
a challenge or obstacle, it can be natural for players to
focus on that structure rather than the story that the
mechanics are trying to tell. A subsystem stripped of all
its life and narrative depth can become nothing more
than a large number of die rolls, however, and the last
thing you want is to lose the magic, especially with a
subsystem the PCs enjoy. Sometimes, a simple check is
the right way to handle the scene, and that’s okay! The
subsystems will be there when you need them to spice
up an adventure or really dive deep into a particular
element or scene. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.664,r=0.864,b=0.939), with ID 8caa7216-cde4-4356-b343-f225b34f8126 -->

# VICTORY POINTS

*You’ll often find that your games could use a way to track progress toward a goal so that you don’t have to just keep everything in your head. This section explains how to build your own subsystems for tracking success via Victory Points. Many other subsystems throughout the chapter use these as well, though often by a different name.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.076,r=0.908,b=0.186), with ID 12d93b66-e488-4c3c-8ebb-14d4e7a060c7 -->

Victory Points (or VP) are a powerful tool in your GM arsenal, as they allow you to track the PCs’ progress using a subsystem to go beyond the results of a single check. Victory Points are versatile; you could track and resolve them within a single encounter, or you could collect them over the course of an entire campaign to determine the ending of the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.218,r=0.514,b=0.326), with ID 7dc58b53-3c38-41b3-bbef-a3c85b789acb -->

# Naming Your Victory Points
It can be fun to rename your Victory Points, to better reflect the subsystem they track. The term “Victory Points” is unspecific, so you can create a name for your Victory Points that fits the theme of your adventure and helps the players feel more like they are taking part in the type of activity your subsystem represents. Examples of renamed VPs include Influence Points (page 187), Infiltration Points (page 196), Research Points (page 190), and Reputation Points (page 200). The name should be representative, and the PCs should understand what it refers to. You can leave off the word “Points” if you prefer, though this section often retains it while describing how Victory Points can be used. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.336,r=0.531,b=0.665), with ID 7bf9a8f0-1f4c-4df9-8838-3320be977475 -->

# Victory Point Subsystem Structures
There are a few common structures for tracking Victory Points that you might use for your new subsystem. You could come up with a structure based off one of the subsystems below, or you could create your own completely different structure if none of them match the way you’re running your game. The most important thing is to consider how the PCs or their opposition gain or lose various forms of Victory Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.673,r=0.515,b=0.833), with ID c8e43ce7-f75d-4dee-a6d5-ac50970837ab -->

**Accumulating Victory Points**  
The most common structure is to accumulate Victory  
Points toward a total, either stopping after reaching a  
success threshold or collecting as many Victory Points  
as possible in a given time frame and then measuring  
the results against various thresholds. The influence <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.842,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID 94af3e20-cb13-4fe6-a4af-ad7b3087b911 -->

subsystem on page 187 is a great example of this
structure in action: each PC has a certain number of
chances to influence various NPCs, and after reaching a
particular threshold of Victory Points with an NPC, the
PCs have convinced that NPC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.220,r=0.906,b=0.295), with ID 759c0375-a47f-4957-add8-55cd4299633d -->

In a variation of this structure, the PCs’ adversaries can
also accumulate Victory Points, giving the PCs a moving
target—either to reach the goal before the adversary or
to have more Victory Points than the adversary at the
end of a given time frame. This is a great structure for
you to use in a situation where the PCs face opposition
rather than having the PCs accumulate Victory
Points while adversaries decrease the total,
since it’s dynamic and less at risk of
resulting in a stalemate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.297,r=0.905,b=0.450), with ID c2894448-86c2-4649-a81c-8a0bedb102da -->

You can track a subsystem at a larger scale, like over the course of an adventure or campaign, by granting the PCs Victory Points for achieving difficult goals or making particular decisions. Such subsystems usually ask the PCs to compare their accumulated Victory Points against several ranked tiers that each having varying results on the story. Typically these results become more positive for the PCs as they acquire more Victory Points, but sometimes succeeding too fully could have unintended consequences, like convincing the workers to support a rebellion so thoroughly that it riles up a mob. If you’re making your own subsystem, you might not define these ranks in full, but just use your best guess at the end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.449,r=0.905,b=0.723), with ID 308436ad-1f75-4935-aed5-529d15716086 -->

Accumulating Rolls  
In cases where the PCs need to make checks to gain Victory Points, the amount they get for the degrees of success is up to you. The default scale detailed below works in most cases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.737,r=0.903,b=0.815), with ID 415dc005-8210-486d-861f-e8f454a421d6 -->

Critical Success The PCs gain 2 Victory Points.
Success The PCs gain 1 Victory Point.
Critical Failure The PCs lose 1 Victory Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.816,r=0.812,b=0.862), with ID 66712ac7-064e-404e-9d6f-a1bd522f92cc -->

This means that the result of a PC’s check usually
results in the party gaining either 1 or no Victory Points.
However, specialized PCs have a solid chance of earning
the party 2 Victory Points, and hare-brained schemes
have a fair chance of losing the PCs 1 Victory Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.862,r=0.903,b=0.940), with ID bb603a47-31c7-44d3-84d5-5d0dc3fd574e -->

### Diminishing Victory Points
Using this method, the PCs start with a certain number of Victory Points, and rather than accumulating them, they attempt to avoid losing them. Perhaps the PCs are trying to keep dragon eggs from cracking, or are otherwise attempting to minimize damage, loss, or danger. This variant is less common, but it’s great at conveying the urgency of a situation as the PCs lose points. Sometimes it’s necessary to add that sense of tension with this subsystem! Typically, when the PCs lose all their Victory Points, a negative event occurs. If they’re on a timer, the final results might be better the more points they manage to keep before the time runs out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.283), with ID e08cdea7-26a8-4bec-8fb2-18ed8d71f51c -->

Diminishing Rolls
Using this structure, the PCs typically lose Victory Points as a result of failed checks, though they can still lose them for making particularly poor decisions or behaving recklessly. Once again, you can use any scaling consequences that make sense, but the default degrees of success are as follows.
Critical Success If regaining ground is possible, the PCs gain 1 Victory Point. Otherwise, as success.
Success The PCs avoid losing any Victory Points.
Failure The PCs lose 1 Victory Point.
Critical Failure The PCs lose 2 Victory Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.290,r=0.472,b=0.465), with ID 3100bd96-25cb-4f34-bb51-fb27937321cd -->

Multiple Point Subsystems  
In a multiple point subsystem, you have more than one point system, each measuring something different. For example, in a long-distance race, the PCs and their opponents both try to gain their own Marathon Points, and whoever gets to 10 points first wins! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.473,r=0.472,b=0.572), with ID 078221fe-b0d0-492d-b9f6-c22be1e09d70 -->

Infiltration on page 196 offers a different example of
a Victory Point subsystem with multiple types of points.
PCs try to get a certain number of Infiltration Points
to successfully infiltrate a location while avoiding giving
Awareness Points to their enemies through failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.572,r=0.472,b=0.648), with ID 00432c40-2c7f-4808-9d3b-8ebad4e73d69 -->

Consider combining the multiple points with a time
factor, like in infiltrations, where the PCs automatically
accrue Awareness Points over time at a slow rate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.648,r=0.473,b=0.696), with ID 5f453e3a-c511-42e6-834f-32b7b5e0ef69 -->

OBSTACLES AND DCs
When preparing your subsystem, think of the obstacles PCs might face or avenues they can exploit when engaging in your subsystem. Set some DCs for them in advance, using the normal system for setting DCs. Everything else, you can improvise on the spot. If you think your DCs will be higher overall, when you set the number of points needed, choose a value on the lower end (see Setting your Scale below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.704,r=0.472,b=0.832), with ID 2fefde8d-0739-4b7a-b53e-f8dff1ed6f7a -->

Think of some possibilities that are much easier and
some that are harder. Who are your PCs opposing,
and what weak points might that opposition have that
the PCs could exploit? Set those DCs lower or make
overcoming them grant more VP. PCs who do their
research or come up with clever strategies should find it
easier to overcome the challenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.832,r=0.473,b=0.941), with ID 54e3a645-c954-41c8-9c34-fc8ed16c5015 -->

### ENEMY VICTORY POINTS
In addition to giving both the PCs and enemies Victory Points, as mentioned under Multiple Point Subsystems, sometimes it makes more sense to have only the enemies gain or lose Victory Points instead of the PCs. Even though the NPCs are also taking actions, it's usually best to increase or reduce the enemy's Victory Points based on just the PCs' actions, since it maximizes the feeling of player agency. In some rare cases where the foes act directly against the PCs, you might have both PC and foe actions increase the foe's Victory Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.497,t=0.089,r=0.852,b=0.265), with ID 1fd84761-2624-459c-914f-8f4d3430506e -->

Implementing such a subsystem might mean flipping
the normal rolls. For instance, if the PCs were trying to
lower their enemies’ Influence over a faction, a critical
success by a PC would lower the Influence by 2, a
success would lower the Influence by 1, and a critical
failure might give the enemies something to exploit,
raising their Influence by 1. This uses the same effects
as an accumulating roll, but “damages” the enemies’
VP instead of gaining VP for the PCs’ side. While this is
very similar mechanically to the PCs gaining VP, the
thematic connection is much stronger for an intrigue-
based story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.265,r=0.852,b=0.447), with ID 0ba4db49-9a46-44f1-9a01-d1aaeeb6c273 -->

# Setting Your Scale
The number of points it takes to reach a goal will greatly
affect how your subsystem feels during play. If you want
the subsystem to be used for a single scene, such as
one negotiation with a powerful NPC, set the number
lower than if it’s meant to take up most or all of a
game session. The Victory Point Scales table (page 186)
suggests possible values for your Victory Point scale. The
“adventure-wide” scale is for subsystems that are part of
a larger narrative, granting Victory Points when the PCs
overcome entire encounters or dungeons, rather than as
an encounter unfolds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.473,r=0.862,b=0.662), with ID 4e1d0bfd-90a1-4c05-b5a5-0be65c7470e5 -->

This larger scale is intended for subsystems that take a lot of the party’s focus. A subsystem that runs in the background during an adventure should use a smaller scale. This is usually the “adventure-wide, sideline” value. It could be even lower, such as if you have a dungeon-based adventure including several opportunities to interact with a kobold tribe to get some small benefits. Though they appear throughout the adventure, you would use a lower value because attaining the VP is a minor part of the story. In fact, you might choose not to use a VP subsystem at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.663,r=0.862,b=0.832), with ID f9b4f6f5-e319-471b-93e6-006f70d589ab -->

The table also lists numbers for one or more thresholds. These are the point values at which the PCs get a partial benefit (or, for a diminishing subsystem, take a drawback). You should grant partial benefits when the PCs reach a certain threshold or introduce twists to the subsystem to ensure they continue to feel engaged and rewarded over time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.832,r=0.863,b=0.939), with ID e69eaab7-b49d-4ada-852d-2ba72d56b370 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a central figure playing a flute, surrounded by glowing, winged fairies in a lush forest setting with a waterfall in the background. The scene is magical and vibrant, with swirling blue energy effects emanating from the flute.

illustration:  

Scene Overview :  
  • The main subject is a short, humanoid character (possibly a halfling or gnome) standing in the center, playing a silver flute.  
  • The character is dressed in colorful, medieval-style clothing with a red jacket, green kilt, and boots.  
  • Surrounding the central figure are multiple small, humanoid fairies with butterfly-like wings, glowing in yellow and purple hues.  
  • The background features a lush, green forest with a large waterfall cascading down rocks, and a pool of water at the base.  
  • On the left, a satyr-like creature sits on a bench, observing the scene.  
  • The lighting is ethereal, with magical blue swirls and sparkles radiating from the flute, illuminating the fairies and the central figure.  
  • The color palette is dominated by greens, blues, and yellows, creating a mystical atmosphere.

Technical Details :  
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.  
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with careful attention to the magical effects and the fairies’ wings.  
  • No on-image text or UI elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The central figure is in the foreground, occupying the middle of the composition.  
  • Fairies are distributed in a circular pattern around the flute player, some flying and some standing on the ground or rocks.  
  • The satyr-like observer is positioned to the left, partially in shadow, while the waterfall and forest form the background.  
  • The magical energy swirls create a sense of motion and focus attention on the flute and the fairies.

Analysis :  
  • The illustration conveys a sense of enchantment and harmony between the central figure and the magical creatures.  
  • The swirling blue energy visually links the music to the fairies, suggesting the flute playing is summoning or enchanting them.  
  • The composition uses light and color to draw the viewer’s eye to the interaction between the musician and the fairies, emphasizing the magical theme. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.061,r=0.998,b=0.521), with ID 92b3e80c-00b3-45a2-a7c0-1311707ab478 -->

The values also depend on various factors. These might include the DCs, the number of chances the PCs get to gain Victory Points, and the flexibility of how the PCs can deploy themselves (for example, if PCs are all forced to try something they might not be trained in, it could cause critical failures). They might also include the amount of effort the PCs need to spend on tasks that don’t directly earn Victory Points—such as checks to Discover information about NPCs using the Influence subsystem. Keep all these in mind when deciding what end point you want to use. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.662,r=0.513,b=0.817), with ID 02158134-176f-4822-89ca-7ebf70cebc7a -->

RUNNING YOUR SUBSYSTEM  
When running your new subsystem, be sure to keep the  
challenges fresh by using a variety of different skills and  
options to encourage creativity and cooperation, rather  
than just using the same check over and over again, where  
PCs can expect diminishing returns. You can also use  
timers to encourage each PC to participate or even create <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.828,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 0e4ac81a-311c-4a7f-950b-7e0d5cc8ffcf -->

mechanics that directly encourage each PC to participate,
like setting penalties for the same PC attempting checks
repeatedly, or for two PCs attempting the same check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.541,r=0.905,b=0.587), with ID 4e2a3c26-b671-4e9e-a9c3-250b89a069f5 -->

You can even have challenges that require all the PCs to
participate. For instance, if the party’s host is welcoming
every guest individually, each PC might have to make
an impression in their own way, or during infiltration,
each PC might have to test their ability to Impersonate
or Sneak. You’ll likely find that some approaches should
be automatic successes if they’re well-suited to the task,
or automatic failures for ideas that are likely impossible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.587,r=0.905,b=0.709), with ID bb42f2b6-3ad0-4164-a44e-0a27298a69fa -->

REWARDS
How you structure rewards for your subsystem depends greatly on its scope. A subsystem resolved in a single sitting usually gives accomplishment XP unless it is particularly demanding, in which case it could be considered a full-scale encounter. Meanwhile, subsystems that span over the course of multiple sessions or the entire campaign might generate accomplishment XP at meaningful milestones along the way. If you have a long-spanning subsystem that’s fairly low profile and behind the scenes or is not success-oriented, such as a subsystem to track what type of ruler the PCs’ patron will become based on the PCs’ decisions, you might not give XP directly from the subsystem, since in that case “success” is undefined. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.721,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 0afcb93c-bf5f-42b8-9e24-949ab5ffbe22 -->

# INFLUENCE

*When the PCs need to gain favor with or sway over an NPC to achieve their goals, sometimes a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check isn’t enough to get the job done. In these cases, you can implement the influence subsystem in a social encounter.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.077,r=0.863,b=0.166), with ID a6aca0f2-9bc0-4f71-81da-f45f2d1ef607 -->

Influence is a short-term subsystem wherein the PCs accumulate Influence Points during a social encounter with an NPC to represent their increasing influence. These encounters are a race against the clock to reach Influence Point thresholds in order to sway the NPC. It’s perfect for a single social gathering—whether it’s a party, a treaty negotiation, or even an attempt to persuade various members of a panel of judges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.201,r=0.471,b=0.326), with ID 4b64aff8-eeca-46d6-8e5a-6a0c9e79e7e8 -->

Because of the variety of Influence skill options and the
ability to use Perception to uncover more information,
every character has something important to contribute
in the influence subsystem, as opposed to situations
where only one character has Diplomacy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.326,r=0.471,b=0.402), with ID 11651b5b-f913-4a52-b05e-4742c49dcbbc -->

The influence subsystem divides a social encounter
into rounds, with the number of rounds representing the
length of the social event. Rounds last any amount of
time that you determine, depending on the needs of the
narrative, though somewhere between 15 minutes and
an hour is typical. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.403,r=0.471,b=0.494), with ID 1cd61968-906e-45c6-8b72-c96fc52af666 -->

During each round of an influence encounter, each PC
can act once to either Influence or Discover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.494,r=0.470,b=0.526), with ID 55c952fb-0158-4189-a97e-af742ec5565a -->

## Influence Stat Blocks
NPCs in the influence subsystem have little need for many of the statistics you’ll find in an ordinary creature stat block. However, it might help you to prepare for the social encounter by creating an influence stat block for each prominent NPC. These are optional; if you can keep most information straight in your head, you might <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.828,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 8bbe5cf4-b0ef-413d-b32f-997def5d160a -->

skip this step or just write down the first three categories
to keep the numbers straight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.903,b=0.111), with ID 4db56e2f-dbd5-44df-a145-9a5d088616c2 -->

Influence stat blocks are flexible and contain only the
stats that you are essential to running the NPC during
a social encounter, leaving the rest out. The main stats
that matter are the NPC’s Perception and Will modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.112,r=0.904,b=0.173), with ID 720d76bb-c868-4bc0-a911-d09915376a0b -->

NPC NAME

TRAITS
A succinct description of the NPC, such as “Famous musician” or “Popular baron.”
Perception The NPC’s Perception modifier, plus potentially relevant abilities such as scent or truesight.
Will The NPC’s Will modifier, plus any special adjustments.
Discovery The Perception DC to Discover information about the NPC, as well as any skill checks to Discover their DCs.
Influence Skills The skills the PCs can use to Influence the NPC are listed here with their DCs, in order from the lowest DC (the skill that works best) to the highest DC. If a skill isn’t listed but a player gives a strong narrative explanation for using it, you can add it as an appropriate DC (usually the highest listed DC). Diplomacy should usually be on this list, but should rarely be the best skill to Influence an NPC, in order to encourage and reward using Discover to learn and cater to an NPC’s interests. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.184,r=0.905,b=0.462), with ID 6c4fe57a-4a37-46d4-8911-dcabbf22207f -->

Influence Thresholds The number of Influence Points required to Influence the PC, and the benefits for meeting them. Some NPCs might have multiple influence thresholds, granting the PCs additional benefits or favors as they cross more thresholds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.465,r=0.903,b=0.538), with ID 1b11a9e1-819c-4347-a914-443df3d5d485 -->

Resistances Some NPCs are resistant to certain tactics, biased against certain types of people, or may get defensive when a certain topic comes up. Any of these makes it harder for a PC to convince them. For instance, an NPC might find flattery inane, dislike wizards, or bristle at any mention of their ex-spouse. Typically, an NPC's resistance increases the DC of the associated check to Influence by 2 (or 5 for stronger resistances), but it could have farther-ranging consequences, such as losing Influence Points or angering the NPC enough that attempting to Influence them again is impossible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.541,r=0.903,b=0.707), with ID aaf079aa-92a7-4e49-b426-6ed8514bddb6 -->

Weaknesses Most NPCs have at least one weakness that clever and observant PCs can use to their advantage, whether it’s a deep-seated insecurity, a desire for power, a favorite hobby, a bias toward a certain group, or a hidden secret the PCs could threaten to expose. When a PC incorporates an NPC’s weakness, it typically decreases the associated Influence check’s DC by 2 (or 5 for stronger weaknesses), but it could have farther-ranging effects, such as gaining automatic Influence Points or even automatically influencing the NPC regardless of how many Influence Points the PCs have achieved so far. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.710,r=0.904,b=0.876), with ID 0afef977-e473-48af-bbed-0139a17f07b1 -->

After the influence stat block, you might want to list
important information to help you roleplay the NPC
and incorporate the NPC into your influence encounter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.893,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 45d8c89b-360c-4129-bd71-3ee9c8cf793c -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration depicting three characters in a dramatic confrontation or discussion, set in a dimly lit, arched stone environment.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Three characters are the main focus, positioned in the foreground.
  • The left character has long white hair, wears a blue and white robe with a black belt, and is gesturing assertively with a raised finger.
  • The central character is bald, dressed in light brown and white clothing with a utility belt, and stands with one hand on their hip.
  • The right character has pointed ears (suggesting an elf or similar fantasy race), short purple hair, and is dressed in dark, fitted clothing with multiple straps and buckles, raising a fist in a confrontational or passionate gesture.
  • The background features large stone arches and a shadowy, dungeon-like atmosphere with cool, muted colors.

Technical Details :
  • No visible text, scale bars, or UI elements.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with highlights on the characters and deep shadows in the background.
  • The color palette is dominated by blues, purples, and muted earth tones.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The three characters form a loose triangle, with the left and central characters facing the right character.
  • The left character is closest to the viewer, partially turned away, while the right character is further back and to the right.
  • The composition draws attention to the interaction and tension between the characters.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a moment of intense discussion or argument, with body language suggesting disagreement or negotiation.
  • The setting and character designs indicate a fantasy or role-playing game context, emphasizing drama and narrative tension. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.061,r=0.876,b=0.523), with ID 8f171f7c-ec34-4e7c-bc2b-96295f1a3a71 -->

You can list any of the following details that are relevant to your NPC: their background (a brief bio focusing on information relevant to the encounter), appearance, personality (this can just be a list of adjectives), affiliations, public goals, hidden agendas, or the penalty for antagonizing the NPC (or possibly for failing to Influence the NPC, depending on the way you structure the encounter). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.538,r=0.472,b=0.664), with ID 713c2caf-3f48-4577-bb13-74eae180a5b3 -->

Setting DCs  
When setting DCs, it’s often good to start with a noncombat level or “social level” for the NPC and set their DCs accordingly. Use the DC adjustments from page 53 just like you normally would. A good starting place is setting the NPC’s Will modifier, then taking that DC and adjusting it for skills that are more or less likely to work. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.673,r=0.471,b=0.800), with ID 75143daf-48b9-4753-b057-fbe4a7d62f63 -->

For instance, for a 3rd-level challenge, you might give an NPC a +12 Will modifier and use 22 as the base DC. You might say that's the DC for Diplomacy but then determine that the NPC is difficult to intimidate, and so you apply the hard DC adjustment to make the Intimidation DC 24. Maybe you also determine that she loves different varieties of wine, resulting in an incredibly easy DC adjustment to get DC 12 for Alcohol Lore. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.801,r=0.471,b=0.939), with ID e1f478e3-ab10-4d48-93fe-09845e6876a2 -->

# RUNNING AN INFLUENCE ENCOUNTER
When running an influence encounter, let the PCs be creative and use a diverse set of skills whenever possible. Be open to improvisation, and change the structure of the encounter if something interesting presents itself. The PCs set the pace and choose with whom they interact. It’s up to you to make sure every NPC is distinct, react to the PCs’ interactions with the NPCs, and lend overall structure to the encounter by making sure it feels like a living, breathing event rather than just a series of skill checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.537,r=0.862,b=0.708), with ID 8c415e24-95e5-4021-8126-6abebe69b5b0 -->

Think about how the number of rounds of a social
encounter relate to the overall event. For instance, if you
have a four-course banquet and 6 rounds, you could have
1 round for introductions before the food arrives, 1 round
for each of the courses, and 1 last round of conversations
after the final course. NPCs might filter in and out or
become unavailable for conversations as they are occupied
by various tasks, or become particularly eager to engage a
PC. That sort of change help makes the NPC feel a bit more

# RESEARCH

*When the PCs are trying to discover important information while challenged by a time limit or other interesting twist, the research subsystem is just the thing to lend their efforts more urgency and weight.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.081,r=0.906,b=0.165), with ID 33979529-f2d1-4e4f-bb34-a2f9ef1d9ccc -->

In the research subsystem, PCs accumulate Research
Points and learn new information or gain other benefits
upon reaching specific thresholds. This subsystem is great
for granting PCs more in-depth pieces of information as
they continue to explore an area at large. Here, time passes
in rounds spanning anywhere from 10 or so minutes to a
full day. Each round, the characters use the Research
exploration activity to gain Research Points (RP). As time
passes and the party earns more RP, they gain knowledge
and rewards, but also might face consequences or events.
Some of these events might interrupt the round with
a different kind of encounter (disrupting the Research
activity), such as a social encounter with an intelligent
book or a combat encounter with a guardian. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.203,r=0.514,b=0.418), with ID d84e1fae-763d-4baa-80cb-acdb8f13de47 -->

Research challenges work best when the PCs face
a time constraint, rival research group, or other
form of external condition that presents
additional pressures—if the PCs have all the
time in the world to safely peruse a library
or ruin, you can usually simplify things
to a simple skill check, since the PCs
are free to keep rolling until they
uncover everything there is to find. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.419,r=0.467,b=0.556), with ID b5e659d3-36c0-4d1a-a7c4-6d0e6497594d -->

# BUILDING A RESEARCH CHALLENGE
A research challenge has two components: the library, which is an area containing the various research checks PCs need to attempt to learn about the topic (as well as obstacles that the PCs face while doing so); and a research stat block, which details the topic being researched and contains the information, rewards, and additional complications that happen when the PCs reach certain thresholds of RP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.564,r=0.384,b=0.803), with ID d4a68a08-fc87-454e-b336-36233be51cc4 -->

Designing the Library
“Library” is the general term to designate the setting of the PCs’ research. Despite the name, it doesn’t necessarily consist of a quiet hall full of books. It could be an Astral memory palace, a gallery of iconographic artwork, or even <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.812,r=0.386,b=0.941), with ID c9cc5ee7-a49d-4344-985d-0cbd835a032c -->

a mansion where the party is questioning the guests. In
many ways, designing a library is similar to designing any
other dungeon, castle, or adventure locale, with various
rooms or other areas, each with its own complications for
the PCs to overcome. If your library is closer to a dungeon
crawl on a tactical map, these are likely hazards or
encounters with hostile creatures; if your library is meant
to be meandered through more narratively, these might
instead be skill-based or social encounters with NPCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.205,r=0.904,b=0.340), with ID 18c8b809-1a2c-4677-8981-b178667a2338 -->

Throughout the library, you’ll place research checks.
These describe the task that the party is doing to Research—
perusing books, alchemically testing samples, or talking to
a stubborn librarian—and a number of skills and DCs the
party can use with the Research activity, in order from the
lowest DC (the skill that works best) to the highest DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.341,r=0.904,b=0.434), with ID b5f2a16f-d3c6-439b-8b05-7d618ee557d7 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration showing a person carrying a large stack of books, accompanied by a block of text describing the "Research" activity in a tabletop roleplaying game, including rules for skill checks and outcomes.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a person in medieval or fantasy attire, holding a large stack of books in both arms.
  • The setting suggests a library or scholarly environment, implied by the books and the context of the text.
  • The perspective is a three-quarter view, showing the subject from the knees up.
  • The colour palette is muted, with earth tones dominating the clothing and books.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The image is integrated with a text box describing game mechanics for research activities.
  • The text includes headers ("RESEARCH", "CONCENTRATION", "EXPLORATION") and details about skill checks, outcomes (Critical Success, Success, Critical Failure), and advice for game masters.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The stack of books is held in front of the subject, obscuring part of their torso.
  • The subject stands slightly off-centre, with the books forming a vertical visual anchor.
  • The text box is positioned to the right of the subject, occupying a significant portion of the image.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually reinforces the theme of research and scholarship, matching the adjacent game rules text.
  • The composition draws attention to the burden and effort of research, as symbolised by the heavy stack of books. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.357,t=0.442,r=0.907,b=0.941), with ID c9c64aaf-edf5-4b38-b24c-1c359c477d27 -->

Each research check also has a maximum RP value.
After reaching this value, the PCs can’t gain any more RP
from that research check (they don’t gain more information
by reading the same book over and over!) so they’ll need
to continue exploring to find more locations for further
research. You can use this to guide your PCs through your
library by placing research checks in various sections you
know you want them to explore—an easy check near the
entrance to introduce them to the topic is usually helpful
as well! Be sure that your library provides enough RP for
players to meet all the research thresholds in the stat block. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.253), with ID 5c3d7d3c-201a-4935-9ff7-9cd6dfe6324d -->

Designing the Stat Block
Once you’ve decided what your library looks like and how the areas and research options are structured, it’s time to build the stat block and set research thresholds for each topic. Thresholds are your opportunity to reward your PCs with intriguing new information (like the history of the town they’re in), tactical intel (such as a legendary monster’s only weakness), uncommon or rare options (like a lost spell in the library’s depths), or anything else. A mix of rewards is best! Backstory can be interesting, but isn’t much of a reward on its own. Research that uncovers only backstory should appear only at the lowest thresholds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.259,r=0.473,b=0.449), with ID 68a47047-f396-44c1-a282-9ecb0080e917 -->

Reaching thresholds can also change the state of the
library, in the PCs’ favor or otherwise. In a dusty room,
the first threshold might simply be cleaning and organizing
the library to lower subsequent checks, but in a haunted
library, ghosts might start appearing as their resting place is
increasingly disturbed. Reaching a research threshold can
do just about anything, but it should always do something.

Think about the constraints preventing the PCs from
researching freely, and use those constraints to determine
how many Research Points they must earn to reach each
threshold. You don’t need to evenly space thresholds—you
could require very few Research Points for crucial clues you
want to ensure the PCs receive and a much larger number to
reach the final threshold that grants a special reward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.448,r=0.474,b=0.662), with ID 19c4e12c-a6f3-4a13-a4af-a82bb207a6c5 -->

In a published adventure, you'll find stat blocks presented
in the format below. In some cases, this information appears
in a single stat block instead, but the rules function the same. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.663,r=0.473,b=0.711), with ID 52380a11-0b7f-4a0e-bbdc-3120b151185f -->

any other important details. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.876,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 11c6655b-d8e8-44e1-992e-0970e9cb71b7 -->

SAMPLE RESEARCH CHECKS AND STAT BLOCK

5  Research Points The PCs learn of apocryphal fey
legends that say the coven members were once cruel
fey queens now twisted by inner corruption. They learn
basic details about hags and the hag mother’s Call. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.479,r=0.850,b=0.540), with ID 23c05c4e-c2e4-4241-b1ce-c266025dddff -->

10  Research Points The PCs learn that the coven gathers
on a nearby mountaintop every full moon. Attaining
this knowledge comes at a cost: hag malice solidifies
into two will-o'-wisps, which attack the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.540,r=0.850,b=0.601), with ID 8fd8896c-e53d-47d9-92d3-0eb1aa5bfbb0 -->

15  Research Points The PCs learn that a specific magical
incantation is needed to reach the hag’s mountaintop.
Though they don’t quite discover the incantation, they
discover among magical writings a page containing
the uncommon spell *read omens*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.601,r=0.851,b=0.678), with ID c10d512b-f631-44b7-933d-040f2e6f0d1e -->

20  Research Points The Loremother Tree awakens long
enough to tell the PCs the incantation, but warns them
that the hags possess powerful magic that has struck
down many heroes. The tree then returns to slumber.
Replace the Loremother Tree’s Performance Research
check with a DC 28 Diplomacy check to convince the
tree to share further knowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.678,r=0.851,b=0.785), with ID 9c5b00fd-dffe-4f38-8058-1917a1acff43 -->

30  Research Points A dryad emerges from the trunk of the Loremother Tree and tells the PCs about the hags’ spell—a unique polymorph ability that turns people into toads. She also gives each PC a small flower charm for protection that grants each PC a +3 status bonus to their saving throws against the hags’ Toad Form ability. Unfortunately, this draws the hags’ attention, who send two living wildfires to burn the glade down. If the PCs don’t defeat the fire elementals, the creatures destroy any remaining information in the glade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.785,r=0.851,b=0.941), with ID 9c6d040d-cb55-4ac6-bc33-8976bd335a6c -->

Summary : This image shows a stylized, symmetrical decorative motif with two abstract human-like figures and a central diamond shape, rendered in gold and green on a dark background.
illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a decorative border or emblem featuring two abstract, circular-headed figures with raised arms on either side of a central diamond.
  • The color palette consists of dark green, gold, and brown.
  • The composition is symmetrical, with the diamond shape in the center and the figures mirrored on each side.
Technical Details :
  • No text, scale bar, or UI elements are present.
  • The lines are outlined in gold, with the background split between dark green (top) and dark brown (bottom).
Spatial Relationships :
  • The diamond is centrally placed, with the two figures flanking it symmetrically.
  • The figures' arms curve upward and outward, framing the diamond.
Analysis :
  • The design suggests a heraldic or ornamental purpose, possibly for a logo, banner, or decorative border, emphasizing symmetry and stylized human forms. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.893,t=0.521,r=0.999,b=0.562), with ID eb1d2f0a-d844-404c-9c04-914fb96b142e -->

# CHASES

*When the PCs pursue a fleeing adversary or quarry—or someone chases them instead—adding twists and turns to the pursuit builds suspense and makes the outcome more uncertain than if it were based on Speed alone. The chases subsystem helps you create cinematic scenes where the PCs must quickly overcome obstacles, from following someone through a crowded market to carrying a desperately urgent message over a dangerous mountain pass.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.078,r=0.910,b=0.204), with ID ef3a949f-bfc1-4623-8e6c-6e435c26f3f0 -->

The Speed rules in *Player Core* work well for short sprints
through fairly clear terrain. Over longer distances and
through more complex environments, though, the path is
rarely so straightforward. The chase subsystem shifts the
emphasis from raw Speed to facing down the kinds of
unpredictable obstacles that characters might encounter in
a longer pursuit, so you can create a thrilling chase scene. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.247,r=0.515,b=0.356), with ID 9570c39b-633f-4a0c-b190-dd3a0e5d4bec -->

Chases are a special type of encounter. Each round, the pursued character or characters act first, then the pursuing characters act. Typically, to reduce variance, the PCs roll checks to progress while their opponents proceed at a steady pace, but if you want to emphasize the back-and-forth nature of a particular chase, you could have both sides roll instead. Characters in the same group can act in whatever order they prefer, each taking a turn. A character must act on their turn. If they pass their turn or are unable to act, they're unable to help the group and automatically cause the group to lose 1 Chase Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.356,r=0.515,b=0.525), with ID b060321e-2a7d-48e0-aae7-e2a5514c9b0e -->

Depending on the scale of your chase, establish at the
beginning how long each round lasts so the PCs understand
how much they can accomplish in that time. Is it essentially
a 3-action turn, or does it take minutes, hours, or days? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.525,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID 9fe92b6d-7a04-45a4-a4e6-4f964c943eb0 -->

OBSTACLES
During a chase, all the characters must overcome a series of obstacles that represent challenges—from locked doors to deceptive bogs—during the different legs of the pursuit. These obstacles aren’t separated by specific distances; rather, the distance is narrative and can vary between obstacles as needed for the story you’re telling. Travel times between obstacles can vary, too. The time scale you choose determines how PCs can act when dealing with an obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.598,r=0.513,b=0.739), with ID e69fea6a-436e-4f76-9a86-4ee3537761b2 -->

Each obstacle requires a certain number of Chase Points
to overcome. Typically, half the obstacles require 1 point
fewer than the number of party members, and half require
2 points fewer (with a minimum of 1 Chase Point per
obstacle). Particularly challenging obstacles might require
more. Typically, there are multiple ways to overcome an
obstacle; for example, characters could evade a guard or
bribe them to look away. Each approach usually requires
a skill check or Perception check, but sometimes a saving
throw, an attack roll, or something even more unusual, like
casting a certain spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.741,r=0.514,b=0.907), with ID ab8e5329-171d-412d-92b0-2ad3487fcb51 -->

On a character’s turn, they describe what they do to
help the group get past the obstacle. They then attempt <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.909,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID 48bb5a34-501a-463f-86db-1e07a57845b2 -->

any required roll, or perform the required action for a
choice without a check. If they attempt a roll, the result
determines how many Chase Points the character gains.
Critical Success The PCs gain 2 Chase Points.
Success The PCs gain 1 Chase Point.
Critical Failure The PCs lose 1 Chase Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.250,r=0.905,b=0.342), with ID f9d13636-d4bd-4655-a30b-cc506ef1a623 -->

If the means of bypassing the obstacle helps automatically  
without requiring a check—such as using a certain spell  
to assist—the PCs typically get 1 Chase Point. You can  
increase that to 2 if you feel the action is extremely helpful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.357,r=0.903,b=0.417), with ID 446dad4c-9dd8-4926-b96e-93f2d4876d51 -->

Chase Points represent the ability of the whole group to bypass the obstacle. A character who critically succeeds is able to help the other characters continue onward, while one who critically fails needs extra assistance. Players often have ideas for ways to overcome the obstacle beyond the choices you created for the obstacle. If their idea is applicable, you’ll need to determine the DC and skill, or other statistic being used for that approach. This is great as long as it’s creative, but be wary of a situation where a character who is legendary at a skill tries to justify how they can bypass every obstacle with that skill, such as using Acrobatics to tumble around them all, or the like. You can determine that some tactics just won’t work against certain obstacles, or would help only one character without benefiting the rest and therefore aren’t all that useful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.418,r=0.903,b=0.661), with ID 989d9f33-7b0f-4093-8c87-7f4319a21538 -->

Once the PCs accumulate enough Chase Points to overcome the obstacle, they move on to the next. Extra Chase Points don’t carry over to the next obstacle. However, anyone who hasn’t already taken their turn that round can still take it against the new obstacle. Consequently, the characters best suited to overcoming the current obstacle might act first, since the remaining characters might be better suited against the next one. The number of Chase Points the PCs have can never fall below 0. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.664,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID efc28dec-67b2-4224-b8e0-681520386a8f -->

It might help to put your obstacles in a stat block for easy reference. Inside published adventures, chase obstacles are likely to be presented in stat block form, as follows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.802,r=0.903,b=0.846), with ID 9691e8ad-8fb0-4ceb-b368-dad35e5db1dc -->

When building a chase, first build your obstacles, and then decide how far ahead the pursued character or characters begin and at what pace the NPCs will move. Having the NPCs clear one obstacle per round is a good rule of thumb, but it could vary depending on the situation, and should especially be slower against obstacles that require more than the typical number of Chase Points to overcome. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.203), with ID 7beb042a-bc39-4edd-8a53-8d1fbdf06774 -->

Select or build obstacles highlighting a variety of
different skills and other options so everyone in the party
has a moment to shine. When choosing what skills can
bypass a given obstacle, ensure a variety of approaches
can work. If you’ve already decided that an obstacle uses
Stealth, selecting Thievery as the other option doesn’t
really offer opportunities for different types of characters,
since those who are good at Thievery are very likely the
same ones who are good at Stealth. On the other hand,
offering Athletics as an alternative gives a champion
who’s terrible at Stealth a way to help. The group can help
cover for a character who is less capable at a particular
obstacle, but it’s more fun for players when you present
substantially different options for each obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.203,r=0.473,b=0.419), with ID b94295ac-2799-4f70-a5a4-502784ff3188 -->

Use the following guidelines to determine how many
obstacles you need for your chase. These numbers assume
that the pursued party can reach a certain location to end
the chase (as described in Ending Chases). If there’s no
such escape, you might need more obstacles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.418,r=0.474,b=0.495), with ID d13653f0-2276-482d-ba1c-b021bfec07d3 -->

**Short:** 6 obstacles, about 10–20 minutes of game time  
**Medium:** 8 obstacles, about 15–25 minutes of game time  
**Long:** 10 obstacles, about 20–30 minutes of game time <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.100,t=0.495,r=0.472,b=0.544), with ID ae03f632-b587-4dc7-b24a-a5652dd902cf -->

Setting Obstacle DCs  
When you set the DCs for an obstacle, you’ll typically be using simple DCs. Use a proficiency rank that’s generally appropriate for the PCs’ level if you want the obstacle to be a significant obstacle. As noted earlier, you’ll typically want to select a couple different ways the group can get past an obstacle. At least one check should have an easy or very easy adjustment, while the other check should have a standard or hard DC. In some cases, you might use something other than a simple DC; for example, if a specific NPC has put up a magical barrier, you would use their spell DC. This might result in some pretty tough DCs or even impassable obstacles, so use this carefully!

If a PC improvises a different way to get around an obstacle from what you planned, set the DC just like you would normally when picking a DC on the fly. Don’t worry about adjusting the DC to be easy or very easy, because the PC is likely to be good at the skill they’ve chosen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.550,r=0.473,b=0.833), with ID 7a72a574-b2b1-4f02-9e0c-0056afb6b544 -->

Shortcuts and Split Paths  
You might want to build a chase with multiple paths that split and rejoin so you can have a shortcut (with easier DCs or fewer obstacles) or paths that appeal to different types of characters. For instance, one obstacle might allow a PC who critically succeeds at a Perception check to find <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.841,r=0.473,b=0.943), with ID d8ac39b9-475e-42c2-9fe8-08389da671a4 -->

## SOLO CHASES
Sometimes circumstances might require you to run a chase where the PCs are each progressing individually, rather than as a group, such as if they get split up. The danger therein is that a player can easily become frustrated if their character is stuck at an obstacle where it’s extremely difficult to succeed at either choice, and no allies can help them. In these chases, it’s best to allow even a single success to be enough for a character to progress to the next obstacle, and have a critical success give the character a +2 circumstance bonus on their first check against the next obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.073,r=0.863,b=0.297), with ID 9eca6ea1-a611-4580-b40f-72a2f7005971 -->

a faster path along a canal, without the obstacles of a
busy street. This can be fun, but it can also split up the
group. Familiarize yourself with the Solo Chases sidebar
above to make similar adjustments for a divided group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.308,r=0.863,b=0.376), with ID 58400b9d-bc36-44ec-bba8-715d946af0c3 -->

Ending Chases
Once you have the obstacles, decide the end conditions. Chases often end when the pursuer reaches the same obstacle as the pursued, leading to a combat encounter or other scene. However, it’s less clear when to end a chase otherwise. It’s typically best to have an obstacle that ends the chase with the pursued character getting away, as long as they overcome the obstacle before being captured. This is usually better than ending the chase after a certain number of rounds, because reaching a hideaway makes more narrative sense and because you might not be able to predict how far the pursued characters move in those rounds, making you run out of obstacles. You can also end the chase in favor of the pursued characters if they ever get a certain number of obstacles ahead of the pursuers (typically three), as the pursuers simply lose the trail. You should still have an end point to the chase, though, in case that never happens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.382,r=0.864,b=0.667), with ID ce1608e7-e715-4eb2-8213-b0630c092324 -->

- **Chase Down:** The PCs pursue adversaries. The PCs go second in initiative since they’re the pursuers. Start the enemies one obstacle ahead of the PCs (or at the same location for a short chase), and end the chase if the PCs catch up to the enemies, or if the enemies reach a certain location that represents their safety or escape.
- **Run Away:** The PCs attempt to escape. They’ll go first in initiative since they’re being pursued. It’s usually best to start them one obstacle ahead of their foes and end the chase if they reach a certain location or are three obstacles ahead of the foes at the end of a round.
- **Beat the Clock:** The PCs try to get through all the obstacles before a certain number of rounds pass, such as if the PCs are trying to outrun a natural disaster or race in a timed challenge. The number of obstacles should usually equal the number of rounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.672,r=0.865,b=0.943), with ID d3993d75-1bcb-4a20-8f02-965cfdd3ca37 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting a dynamic action scene between a humanoid martial artist and a dragon-like creature in a ruined, rocky environment.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid figure in ornate blue and gold martial arts attire, leaping or flying through the air with one leg extended in a kick.
  • The setting is a chaotic, partially collapsed stone structure with large debris and jagged rebar or roots.
  • The perspective is dynamic, with the viewer positioned slightly above and behind the martial artist, emphasizing the action.
  • The lighting is dramatic, with a strong glow emanating from the dragon's mouth, casting warm highlights and deep shadows.
  • The color palette features cool blues and greys for the environment and figure, contrasted by the fiery orange and yellow of the dragon's breath.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The image includes the "Pathfinder GM Core" branding at the top.
  • Decorative dragon artwork is visible in the upper left margin.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The martial artist is in the foreground, mid-air, facing the dragon.
  • The dragon's head is emerging from the left side, mouth open and emitting fire or magical energy toward the martial artist.
  • The background consists of broken stone walls and debris, suggesting a collapsed or ruined building.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the martial artist and dragon positioned off-center to create a sense of movement and tension.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a moment of high action and danger, emphasizing the martial artist's agility and bravery in the face of a powerful, fire-breathing adversary.
  • The use of lighting and color draws attention to the conflict between the two figures, highlighting the fantasy and adventure themes typical of Pathfinder roleplaying game art. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.005,r=0.996,b=0.518), with ID 0abcde4d-285a-476f-8597-22738c3ff5d8 -->

**Competitive Chase:** The PCs and their adversaries are both chasing the same thing or trying to reach the same location, and whoever gets there first wins. This works like chase down, except that either party could win. Because there is more than one set of pursuers, you might have the PCs and their competitors roll initiative to see who goes first each round (while still moving all NPCs at a steady rate). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.150,t=0.539,r=0.514,b=0.664), with ID 1e8fba1e-0f26-4a77-ae83-404a34abda8a -->

RUNNING A CHASE  
When running a chase, narrate the scene and give vivid  
descriptions of the obstacles the PCs face, rather than  
just reading off a list of skills and immediately having the  
players start rolling dice and making checks. A chase is a  
framework for roleplaying, not just a dice game. Encourage  
the PCs to describe what they’re doing, and how they’re  
helping their comrades overcome each obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.674,r=0.514,b=0.800), with ID 231fb4e1-01b3-480d-945a-92287dc3ee04 -->

Typically, it’s best to tell the players the DCs of the
default options, so they can make informed decisions. At
the very least, you should indicate the relative difficulty of
the clear paths. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.801,r=0.513,b=0.861), with ID 792e37f1-345d-4f83-b6c2-d8019b3f0b3b -->

Try to make it feel like the PCs are really part of a chase
scene, like in a movie. As each side makes progress, describe
how they pull ahead or close the gap. PCs far from their
foes might hear shouts in the distance. As they get closer,
they catch glimpses, and then finally see their quarry in <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.863,r=0.512,b=0.940), with ID 684097f0-276c-43f1-9398-ee76830f10d2 -->

full view once they’re on the enemies’ heels. Think about
how the events of the chase affect the environment as
well. For instance, if a kaiju is chasing after the PCs, after
the PCs overcome an obstacle consisting of a thick copse
of trees, you could describe how the kaiju flattens the
trees beneath its feet as it stomps after them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.540,r=0.905,b=0.633), with ID b99bca57-e301-4897-83a8-e201d7e34acf -->

Visual Aids  
It can help your players visualize the chase to use a series of cards or a rough map (such as a large-scale city map rather than a 5-foot grid) to show locations. Use one miniature or token to represent each side of the chase. You might place cards with obstacle names on them face down, revealing them as PCs reach them, and letting a PC peek at an upcoming card if they scout it from a distance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.644,r=0.905,b=0.771), with ID d010e307-25d0-414e-9580-5a6821c8e0d8 -->

If the PCs Get Stuck  
Sometimes, despite their best efforts, an obstacle will stymie the PCs over and over again. In most cases, after 3 rounds of the PCs struggling with an obstacle that requires the standard number of Chase Points, it’s a good idea to just say they found another way around it. If presenting another way around the obstacle just doesn’t make sense, such as if a spherical barrier completely blocks the PCs, you might introduce an NPC or other outside force that can help them bypass it, but at a high cost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.782,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 6828701f-cfc0-457a-ad49-f420a83a1909 -->

# INFILTRATION

_Not all elements of an adventure can be resolved with force of arms and the sizzle of deadly magic. Sometimes subtlety is required to circumvent foes or accomplish a goal. When the characters need to rely on improvisation and fast thinking to infiltrate a stronghold or organization to save the day, the infiltration subsystem provides a framework for those adventures._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.079,r=0.908,b=0.186), with ID 0204f363-aaa8-4440-bd59-85f7353c15f9 -->

An infiltration requires the heroes to employ guile and
subtlety to achieve one or more objectives without
directly confronting their enemies. The PCs’ goal might be
sneaking into a den of thieves to relieve them of ill-gotten
gains, navigating the winding passages of the city watch
headquarters to break a friend out of prison, or putting
themselves in just the right spot to snatch up the right
person or the correct item at just the right time. Whatever
the case, the heroes are working to avoid drawing the
attention of an opposing party, such as the members of
a thieves’ guild, the prison guards, or the invited guests
at an upscale gala. Should the heroes draw too much
attention, they might be attacked, arrested, or thrown
out—in any case, blocked from accomplishing their goal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.218,r=0.514,b=0.433), with ID f10ce601-e3ca-41a2-b4cf-40b190dda701 -->

An infiltration is fundamentally a roleplaying activity. The players narrate their characters’ actions in response to the situations around them, and the infiltration subsystem provides a framework to measure incremental success within the overall endeavor. An infiltration takes place over the course of multiple rounds, though it’s up to you to determine how long a round is. One round might encompass 10 minutes or 1 hour of in-world time, or something completely different, depending on the story and your group’s preferences. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.434,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID a13ec3b4-3527-434c-afae-7b8995336ff7 -->

# BUILDING AN INFILTRATION
When creating an infiltration, you’ll want to start with the party’s broad goals and an idea of how much time you and your players want to spend. The more complex an infiltration, the longer it will take to play out at the table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.597,r=0.513,b=0.680), with ID 9cafac09-3b61-4dce-bbc2-25c0d09d267f -->

**Objective**  
The first thing you’ll need to determine is the party’s objective, or broad goal. Maybe the PCs need to find their way into some hidden sanctum, find a particular person within an organization, locate and get away with a bit of treasure, or plant a piece of evidence. An infiltration can consist of a single objective, but a more complex one might include two or more objectives in sequence—the PCs might first need to find a way to enter the cult’s sanctum, then open the vault, and then escape with the relic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.690,r=0.513,b=0.846), with ID 06fb07c0-34f5-492e-8d00-9a5544eeec64 -->

To achieve an objective, the PCs must overcome a
certain number of obstacles—specific challenges the PCs
face, such as getting across a moat or past a nosy butler.
For a simple objective, they might need to overcome only
one or two obstacles, while a more complex one might
require several. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.848,r=0.514,b=0.939), with ID 413e108f-64cb-47be-8c56-e31f2be11003 -->

It’s a good idea to offer more obstacles as options than
the characters need to overcome, and the PCs don’t all
have to choose the same ones. This represents the fact
that there’s more than one way into a castle, and allows
PCs to choose obstacles that play to their strengths. It
also means you have more options you can adapt if the
PCs decide on a truly novel way to tackle their objective. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.220,r=0.904,b=0.325), with ID dabce8f7-42c6-42e4-889a-12fa00dc4282 -->

Once a character has overcome the required number of obstacles to reach the objective, they move on to the next objective. This might mean that some characters move on to a second objective and start making progress toward it while other characters are still completing obstacles from the first objective. When all characters have completed the final objective, the infiltration is a success! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.326,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID 7ce11518-cd9e-42de-a3ac-aff19392ded4 -->

While the characters are pursuing their objectives,
however, they need to avoid notice. Awareness Points (AP)
measure the extent to which an opposing party is aware
of the PCs’ actions, and apply to the party as a whole.
As the PCs’ Awareness Points increase, the infiltration
becomes more difficult as the opposition shores up its
defenses. If the PCs generate too many Awareness Points,
they are found out, and their infiltration fails altogether! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.434,r=0.903,b=0.556), with ID 2379b08c-ae09-4504-9f97-2627befb3f3d -->

Obstacles
Each obstacle has certain statistics that define how it works in play. Infiltration Points (IP) represent a character’s progress toward overcoming an obstacle. Each obstacle requires gaining a certain number of Infiltration Points to overcome—typically 1 or 2, but some challenging obstacles might require more. PCs can gain Infiltration Points in multiple ways—usually through a skill or Perception check, but sometimes another roll or even the use of a spell or item. These methods are listed in the obstacle’s Overcome entry. Unlike obstacles for chases, these use a difficulty range for the PCs’ level instead of set DCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.568,r=0.903,b=0.754), with ID 1dd49fd9-e082-4d45-a05b-f41a84d57160 -->

The Overcome entry also lists whether the PCs need
to overcome an object individually or as a group. For
individual obstacles, each PC needs to earn the required
number of Infiltration Points themself, while for group
obstacles, all PCs working toward that obstacle pool their
Infiltration Points toward it together. For example, each PC
trying to scale a wall needs to earn points on their own, but
the PCs could work together to search a guildhall for clues,
and once one PC has picked a lock, everyone can enter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.756,r=0.903,b=0.892), with ID ef24a759-03e8-4a21-8669-b7b7027c1ace -->

A particular PC can overcome an individual obstacle
only once during an objective; likewise, the party can
overcome a group obstacle only once. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.893,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID 12fea5bd-62c0-444f-86e3-4f26951c92e9 -->

Summary : This image shows a large, dark brown number "4" with a light outline, centered on a textured, mottled yellow-brown background.

logo: 
  Scene Overview : 
    • Main subject is a bold, dark brown number "4" with a thin, light-colored outline.
    • The background is a textured, mottled yellow-brown, giving a parchment or stone-like appearance.
    • The number "4" is centered and occupies most of the image area.
  Technical Details : 
    • No visible company name, tagline, or additional text.
    • No other graphic elements, icons, or symbols present.
    • No scale bar or UI elements.
  Spatial Relationships : 
    • The number "4" is centrally placed, with even margins on all sides.
    • No foreground or background separation; the number sits directly on the textured field.
  Analysis : 
    • The image is likely intended as a logo, icon, or marker, with the number "4" as the sole focus. The color palette and texture may suggest a thematic or stylistic association (e.g., vintage, game, or educational context), but no explicit branding is present. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.914,t=0.015,r=0.965,b=0.054), with ID 30813d9a-c7e9-4fef-b395-990c0bd8612c -->

Obstacles in Play
On a character’s turn, the character describes what they do to get past the obstacle. They then attempt any required check (or perform the required action, if their choice doesn’t require a check). The result of the check determines how many Infiltration Points the character gains toward overcoming that obstacle—or whether they instead raise suspicions and accrue Awareness Points!
Critical Success The PC gains 2 Infiltration Points.
Success The PC gains 1 Infiltration Point.
Failure The PCs accrue 1 Awareness Point.
Critical Failure The PCs accrue 2 Awareness Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.472,b=0.265), with ID d66f6ce5-5b2b-4e88-9105-653590ae026c -->

If the character’s actions automatically help without
requiring a check, like using a spell, they usually gain 1
IP, but you can award 2 for particularly helpful actions.

Sometimes a PC might become stuck on an individual
obstacle. Some opportunities (page 198) allow PCs to
spend their turn helping others overcome a tricky obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.278,r=0.472,b=0.376), with ID ebcea052-87d5-4b4f-9db6-835e9d32c806 -->

Pacing  
The number of obstacles you require the PCs to overcome for an objective depends partly on the complexity of the infiltration. For shorter infiltrations, use fewer and lower-IP obstacles; for a longer, more complex heist, you can add more obstacles with greater complexity. Also, bear in mind how many checks the PCs will need to attempt to complete their obstacles. An objective with mostly low-IP group obstacles will move quickly because only a few rolls are required, compared to one with mostly individual obstacles that each PC needs to roll separately for. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.383,r=0.473,b=0.560), with ID d9fbd0df-2def-420b-aa86-8e40a06e27d1 -->

Sample Obstacles  
While you’ll want to create custom obstacles to suit the details of your infiltration, the following examples can be used directly in many infiltrations, or as inspiration for your own creations. You can also use the sample chase obstacles on page 195 as starting points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.566,r=0.473,b=0.666), with ID 41c3567b-cc7d-4757-ba4e-a29b7e59d75f -->

TRAP                                                      OBSTACLE
Infiltration Points 3 (group). Overcome hard or very hard Thievery
A trap bars the characters’ passage. This obstacle follows the normal degrees of success for an obstacle, with the following modification for critical failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.825,r=0.473,b=0.908), with ID 8114af83-ca16-4c99-8fd5-8b5eccae5e4c -->

**Critical Failure** The PCs accrue 2 AP as normal, and the PC who critically fails the Thievery check also triggers the trap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.907,r=0.473,b=0.943), with ID 6d474cb5-8129-459f-a10f-136b16720c5a -->

SETTING INFILTRATION SKILLS AND DCS  
Many of the sample infiltration activities and events give a DC range instead of a fixed DC. Set the DCs based on the standard DC of the party level using the table on page 53, and adjust them using the DC Adjustments on page 53. When given a range of skills for an activity or event, you should vary the difficulty based on the needs of the story. For instance, if a PC is Scouting a Location, you might want to use a low DC for Stealth (because it’s easier to scout when unnoticed), a hard one for Perception (because while the PC might see the enemy, the enemy might also see them), and a very hard DC for Society (because walking in like you belong is difficult if you don’t have an invitation or the right uniform). This not only adds a certain degree of plausibility, but by planning for and allowing a broad range of skills as a means to complete the activity, you also become better prepared for when your players improvise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.074,r=0.861,b=0.385), with ID 091995ba-45b6-4556-8f38-dd3ece9d122b -->

Awareness Points
The trick to any infiltration is to get it done before anyone notices. Awareness Points measure the opposition’s awareness of the PCs’ efforts, helping you keep the pressure on and ramp up the urgency. While Infiltration Points are specific to a given obstacle, Awareness Points are a single pool spanning the entire infiltration and all participants. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.397,r=0.863,b=0.511), with ID ddf25077-defd-49ca-a9a1-88dab69b29f7 -->

Awareness Points increase in three different ways. When
a PC fails a check to overcome an obstacle, they incur 1
Awareness Point (or 2 on a critical failure). Other failed
checks during the infiltration typically don’t increase the
Awareness Point total unless the failure would reasonably
cause a disruption. Awareness Points also increase by 1 at
the end of each round of the infiltration, as the passage of
time makes it more likely that the PCs will be discovered.
Finally, the PCs earn Awareness Points whenever their
activities are disruptive enough to draw attention to the
infiltration, subject to GM discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.510,r=0.864,b=0.678), with ID 100ec723-3ff8-45c8-b588-b38f59e3dad7 -->

The effects of Awareness Points occur when the PCs reach
certain thresholds. The specific effects and thresholds are up
to you and your story, but typically for every 5 AP the PCs
accrue, the challenges become harder, and if the PCs accrue
enough Awareness Points (usually equal to twice the number
of Infiltration Points necessary for the party as a whole to
overcome all necessary obstacles), the infiltration fails. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.678,r=0.864,b=0.786), with ID 7d4b26a5-21ec-4abe-b87d-8c10034c38f5 -->

Each threshold should have an effect. It might increase
the DCs for obstacles, introduce a complication, spark
a combat encounter, or have other effects. Reaching
the highest tier of Awareness Points means that the PCs
fail, but that doesn’t have to be the end of the story!
Failed infiltrations are an opportunity to introduce new
challenges and move the story forward in a different way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.786,r=0.864,b=0.894), with ID 8237e627-8cc2-4fc2-a436-98d6272e6e1d -->

This basic Awareness Point scheme for an infiltration
requiring the PCs to earn 10 IP can be used as is or
tailored to your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.893,r=0.863,b=0.939), with ID cf30e635-7145-443c-9345-f13114c179af -->

Complications  
Sometimes, when a plan goes sour and seems like it can’t get worse, it does. Complications are unexpected problems that compound the difficulty of a challenge. The party might trigger a complication by critically failing a check to overcome a challenge, by reaching a certain threshold of Awareness Points, if you need to spice up the infiltration, or through their own decisions—maybe the wizard’s castle has various wards, each triggered when a PC attempts to use a different kind of magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.229,r=0.515,b=0.387), with ID 66d95805-6b1d-4f22-b3b5-256573842b31 -->

Many complications increase Awareness Points or otherwise make infiltration more difficult. A common form of complication is attracting the attention of guards who try to stop, capture, or even kill the PCs. When this happens, the infiltration may briefly shift into encounter mode as the PCs attempt to defeat their assailants. The sounds of battle are loud, so unless combat occurs in an isolated area or the PCs take precautions, each round of unmitigated combat noise causes them to gain Awareness Points, at the very least. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.388,r=0.514,b=0.540), with ID f3ee52f6-274c-447a-b896-35f2ba3e5024 -->

When you create a complication, decide on the details of
how it will play out. Each complication has a trigger that
determines when it occurs. It might affect only a single
character, or it might affect everyone in a certain area,
and you’ll need to determine whether multiple PCs can
work together to overcome it or whether only one can.
Complications must be overcome before the characters
involved can overcome other obstacles, and attempting
to overcome a complication takes a character’s turn just
like trying to overcome an obstacle. Many complications
are one-off events and are overcome automatically, even
on a failure, though not without a cost. If a complication
requires PCs to gain Infiltration Points to clear it, it has an
Infiltration Points entry, just like an obstacle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.541,r=0.513,b=0.754), with ID 24afebdf-36fa-4992-b6fc-66a9a200fe3a -->

Don’t overwhelm the characters with complications. Typically, you’ll want to aim for two complications per AP threshold. Otherwise, the PCs may end up spending more time on the complications than on the heist itself, and the chance of failure may be too high. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.755,r=0.513,b=0.831), with ID 6b1a534e-4f12-4ed6-853b-ef7b6eed7e74 -->

The following example is a common complication that
could occur in almost any infiltration. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.832,r=0.512,b=0.862), with ID fbdd4af8-10d9-4748-8b91-c695e12ceeab -->

Someone thinks they recognize you, and you must either
convince them otherwise before slipping away or find a way to
dodge the person entirely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.126), with ID 24025755-c59f-4b21-89ce-6bd28c9f82c8 -->

**Success** You convince or otherwise dodge the person.  
**Failure** You are recognized, and the party accrues 1 AP.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the party accrues 2 AP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.127,r=0.860,b=0.172), with ID 4ec6f799-6231-46eb-9975-4cd593e96517 -->

Opportunities  
Not everything that happens during an infiltration is a challenge that must be solved—sometimes PCs can use their turns to aid the group in some way. Opportunities are very similar to obstacles, but they don’t provide Infiltration Points or count toward the objective. They instead provide some kind of benefit, such as a magical password to disable security features further along, reducing the party’s Awareness Points, or lowering the DC for a later challenge. But opportunities sometimes come with risks—failing can increase the PCs’ Awareness Points or trigger complications. You’ll need to decide what opportunities are available and when, and whether they can be completed multiple times or only once. For example, the PCs can steal the guard’s keys only once, but can cause a distraction several times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.184,r=0.904,b=0.418), with ID 6e78730d-5b6a-4d73-b38f-e52d6f234ab5 -->

Some opportunities might be available at almost any
time in any infiltration, like this example. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.419,r=0.904,b=0.449), with ID b73ab8d5-1cd6-42fe-8753-c91415dd7179 -->

SMOOTH THE PATH                        OPPORTUNITY
Requirements The PC has successfully completed an individual objective and some other PCs have not.
Having completed your objective, you help an ally who is still trying to reach that goal. Describe how you are helping. This gives the ally the benefits of Following the Expert (Player Core 438). In unusual cases, the GM might allow you to attempt a relevant skill check to overcome the obstacle on behalf of the other PC instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.459,r=0.905,b=0.601), with ID 76d63224-95a9-4245-a703-4b59e4415bd0 -->

## PC Preparations
Sometimes the party has a chance to prepare before conducting their infiltration, by scouting a location, bribing officials, and so on. This takes the form of special downtime activities that can give the PCs Edge Points (EP): resources and advantages they can bring to bear during their infiltration, such as stolen uniforms, forged documents, and the like. As with infiltration opportunities, careless work runs the risk of increasing Awareness Points—but in this case, before the infiltration even begins! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.612,r=0.903,b=0.769), with ID 6eb59a1c-b132-416a-ad58-13a4facdc87d -->

Typically, you’ll limit the preparation phase in some way,
such as by setting a number of days the PCs have to prepare
and by constraining how many preparation activities
are available to make sure the PCs aren’t entering the
infiltration with so many Edge Points that the infiltration
is no longer suspenseful. The more opportunities for Edge
Points you give, the lower you should set the Awareness
Point thresholds for complications and failure. Also
decide how many times the characters can benefit from
each preparation activity—most activities should grant
their benefits only once. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.771,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 38c626ab-8b57-42eb-8146-a74ac178c892 -->

Edge Points
Edge Points (EP) represent advantages the party gains by proper planning, quick thinking, the intervention of an ally, or some other benefit. They are typically gained by pursuing opportunities in previous infiltrations or through preparation before the infiltration. When a PC fails or critically fails a check to overcome an obstacle or a complication, they can spend an Edge Point to succeed instead. Some Edge Points can be spent only during particular circumstances—for instance, no matter how well you forge documents, it won’t help you unlock a door—so consider using unique tokens to represent such Edge Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.136,r=0.474,b=0.330), with ID a959179f-6ea3-41c5-b7ce-ff2ca7c2cbc0 -->

BRIBE CONTACT

DOWNTIME   SECRET

Cost A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Party Treasure by Level (page 59). Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.364,r=0.474,b=0.464), with ID 7fede85e-14ab-4b86-b462-f85e35bd5ee3 -->

Requirements You’ve successfully Gained a Contact (see below).
You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.
Success The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.
Failure You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.
Critical Failure As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.464,r=0.474,b=0.620), with ID 439da20e-1c84-40e8-8a6b-dfad85b10c78 -->

FORGE DOCUMENTS

DOWNTIME   SECRET

You prepare forgeries that might serve as convincing props. Attempt a hard or very hard Society check.

Success You create convincing forgeries and gain 1 EP you can use only when presenting some form of paperwork.

Failure You create unconvincing documents. You gain 1 EP that (unknown to you) grants no benefit when used.

Critical Failure As a failure, but a PC who tries to use the Edge Point gets a critical failure, even if they use the Edge Point after rolling a failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.626,r=0.474,b=0.804), with ID 0fa3829e-d7bf-4b84-b522-d3545efe86a6 -->

GAIN CONTACT

DOWNTIME
You try to make contact with an individual who can aid you in the infiltration. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC Diplomacy or Society check, or a check using a Lore skill appropriate to your prospective contact.
Success You make contact and gain 1 EP.
Failure You fail to make contact. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.810,r=0.473,b=0.942), with ID f8cdf134-5db6-4893-a713-18b0e40709b6 -->

## INFILTRATION PREPARATION
For most infiltrations, you’ll want to detail the site or group the PCs are trying to infiltrate. This might involve mapping a building or fleshing out NPCs within the organization—or, most likely, both. You likely need to know the party’s objectives before you can decide on these details, but knowing this information can help you brainstorm the obstacles, opportunities, and complications of the infiltration itself. Also, with details on the site and its adversaries, you can more confidently improvise when the PCs do something unexpected! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.071,r=0.864,b=0.284), with ID f7b8e54e-7f88-4ac9-81c8-e341a747a660 -->

Critical Failure You insult or spook the contact in some way.
  Future attempts take a –2 circumstance penalty.
Special Multiple critical failures might cause the contact to work
  against the PCs in some way, likely increasing the party’s
  Awareness Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.292,r=0.865,b=0.375), with ID 77218a44-2bff-43d2-a617-d3e0faed74b7 -->

GOSSIP

DOWNTIME   SECRET

You seek out rumors about the infiltration’s target. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard Diplomacy check.
Critical Success You gain inside information about the location or group you’re trying to infiltrate. This grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to future checks you attempt for preparation activities for this infiltration. If you share this information, those you share it with also gain this bonus.
Success You gain inside information about the place or group you’re attempting to infiltrate that aids your planning.

# REPUTATION

*Sometimes it’s crucial to know how groups of people feel about the PCs. That’s where reputation comes into play. The reputation subsystem is a simple way to use Victory Points to determine how the PCs stand with such groups.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.080,r=0.909,b=0.168), with ID 80eb89ad-7fff-487a-ab2c-e1064f3c24a4 -->

Reputation is a mid- to long-term subsystem wherein the PCs accumulate or lose Reputation Points with a particular group of people, such as a guild, a government, a church, or a village. The PCs gain Reputation Points by performing favors for the organization, to a maximum of 50 Reputation Points, and lose Reputation Points by doing disservices, to a minimum of –50 Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.202,r=0.515,b=0.312), with ID 2c313268-2201-4343-9c24-7f3809572e57 -->

- Minor favors are simple, basic tasks that don’t take too much effort for a PC to perform or much time at the table. Minor favors grant 1 Reputation Point.
- Moderate favors require a significant amount of effort and often take up a session or a noticeable chunk of a single session to complete. Moderate favors grant 2 Reputation Points.
- Major favors are a sizable endeavor, typically an entire quest involving several sessions. Major favors grant 5 Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.322,r=0.516,b=0.527), with ID 38b30337-8665-4d1b-959a-031fa8c8a90c -->

DISSERVICES
On the flip side, disservices are a catchall for ways the PCs might make a group angry, whether it’s through actual malice and planning on the PCs’ part or simply by accident. Unlike favors, disservices don’t have as easy a correspondence with in-game time; a quick but particularly egregious action could easily still be a major disservice. Disservices normally lose the PCs Reputation Points.
• Minor disservices could be small but significant missteps, or accumulated slights and inconveniences. Minor disservices take away 1 Reputation Point.
• Moderate disservices are more than just a nuisance or annoyance, generally significantly hindering the group’s efforts or violating a fundamental tenet of the group’s beliefs in a significant but not egregious way. Moderate disservices take away 2 Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.537,r=0.515,b=0.786), with ID f2fd1d88-3128-49c7-bc85-cda571443a0b -->

- • Major disservices are incredibly antagonistic to a group, usually a single brazen act, such as thwarting a cult’s apocalyptic doomsday plan. Major disservices take away at least 5 Reputation Points, or more if they are particularly egregious. They might be so terrible that the PCs immediately lose all their Reputation Points and *then* lose 5 more Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.202,r=0.906,b=0.312), with ID 68a14017-4087-413f-b994-8eabe0fe4f68 -->

REPUTATIONS
PCs generally start with a reputation of “ignored” with most groups, as most groups have never heard of them. If they are particularly famous or infamous among related groups, the PCs might start with a different reputation of your choice. The reputation is generalized to the whole group—an individual NPC can hold a different opinion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.322,r=0.905,b=0.436), with ID 82a6252f-3be5-4d6e-a479-05a87d0032f4 -->

Ignored  
The PCs either aren’t on this group’s radar or the group knows about the PCs but is generally ambivalent toward them. This carries no special benefits or detriments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.445,r=0.905,b=0.511), with ID 44ccde3c-ee0e-4377-8114-173f16cfdabb -->

Liked
The PCs have gained this group’s favor. Many members of the group know about the PCs, and those who do are usually friendly to them. At this reputation, only moderate and major favors accrue Reputation Points; it takes more to impress the group further. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.521,r=0.905,b=0.618), with ID e1f95f92-00a2-4f2d-87be-99142abe76c1 -->

Admired  
The PCs have earned this group’s admiration. The majority of the group knows about the PCs and have an extremely favorable opinion toward them.

Summary : This is a dark, atmospheric illustration depicting two individuals restrained in a medieval pillory in a rain-soaked town square.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are two figures locked in a wooden pillory, positioned on a raised stone platform.
  • The setting is an old town square, with timber-framed buildings in the background under a stormy, overcast sky.
  • The composition centers the pillory and its occupants, with heavy rain and puddles on the ground, enhancing the somber mood.
  • The color palette is dominated by greys, browns, and muted reds, contributing to a grim, oppressive atmosphere.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The illustration uses dramatic lighting and shadow to emphasize the wetness and misery of the scene.
  • Blood stains and grime are visible on the pillory and the individuals' clothing, suggesting recent violence or public humiliation.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The pillory is centrally placed in the foreground, with the two figures side by side.
  • Chains are attached to the pillory, extending out of the frame, indicating secure restraint.
  • The background buildings are blurred and recede into the distance, focusing attention on the pillory.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a strong sense of punishment, suffering, and public shaming in a medieval or fantasy setting.
  • The use of rain, dark clouds, and muted colors heightens the feeling of despair and isolation.
  • The detailed depiction of the pillory and the figures' postures emphasizes their vulnerability and the harshness of their predicament. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.060,r=0.877,b=0.520), with ID d0f22949-1fc0-49f6-8383-1d2ec70e2cc0 -->

**Disliked**
The PCs have a poor reputation among members of this group. Many members of the group know about the PCs, and are usually unfriendly to them. At this reputation, only moderate and major disservices reduce Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.596,r=0.471,b=0.682), with ID 00b4ce5d-13bd-4f0a-ab05-3e3010ee1f8a -->

### Hated
The PCs have earned this group’s ire. The vast majority of the group knows about the PCs and have an extremely unfavorable opinion toward them. Many members of the group are hostile toward the PCs, and those who aren’t are unfriendly. When presented an easy opportunity to hurt the PCs, the group will jump at the chance. Only major disservices can still reduce Reputation Points. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.689,r=0.472,b=0.819), with ID 21553415-05ca-4974-914f-4b09cbf3d0c2 -->

**Hunted**  
The group actively hunts the PCs as scapegoats or nemeses, even at significant cost to itself. Every member has heard of the PCs, is hostile toward them, and would take major risks to thwart or destroy them. Only major disservices can still reduce Reputation Points, and only moderate or major favors can increase them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.827,r=0.472,b=0.942), with ID 984c5346-6211-4578-b2cb-0bcb5953c71f -->

REPUTATION IN
PATHFINDER SOCIETY ORGANIZED PLAY
Pathfinder Society Organized Play uses a version of the reputation subsystem with various factions to offer unique benefits for different characters, with different Reputation Point thresholds that are adapted to the Organized Play structure. Check it out for inspiration for reputation in your own game! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.532,r=0.862,b=0.693), with ID ea1ba1ba-fd81-4cc4-90e3-523514a55442 -->

# Running Reputation
Using Reputation Points in the background allows you to track the PCs’ status with a variety of groups or factions based on the PCs’ actions and choices. This is especially useful for a sandbox campaign or other structure with numerous possibilities, helping you build a reactive structure and track how PCs are doing with groups they interact with only occasionally. When the point totals don’t fit the story, use common sense. For instance, if the PCs are hunted by the town guard due to a corrupt mayor, but then perform a major quest revealing the mayor’s wrongdoing and saving the town, that might jump them from the worst negative reputation to a much more positive reputation. Similarly, the PCs’ foes could frame them, harming the PCs’ reputation even though they’ve done no disservice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.703,r=0.864,b=0.943), with ID 0ab4349a-7dc7-4fc8-b646-11861d5bd08a -->

# DUELS

*Sometimes conflicts become personal. It’s not the entire group against a challenge, but one character struggling against the skills of a single adversary. In many societies, duels are considered a reasonable way to resolve individual differences, though others consider such practices—especially the more deadly varieties—to be an affront to law and order. Duels can come in several forms, and this section gives you rules to run them.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.076,r=0.914,b=0.203), with ID b47744ba-9c29-4d3b-9dd2-9371bcb17266 -->

Setting Up a Duel
Participants must willingly agree to the duel and to abide by its rules. If one of the duelists breaks the duel’s rules (and, more importantly, is caught doing so), that duelist loses, taking any penalties agreed upon when the challenge was accepted. Here are some sample dueling rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.227,r=0.516,b=0.342), with ID 74c027c4-4ce9-4c22-a2e6-7249a47bc3dc -->

Summary : This is a full-body character illustration of a swashbuckler or duelist, depicted in a dynamic fencing pose with period-appropriate clothing and weaponry.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a single human figure in a dramatic, action-oriented stance, holding a rapier in the right hand and a small buckler (round shield) in the left.
  • The character wears a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a large, colorful feather (green, orange, and yellow).
  • Clothing includes a loose, cream-colored shirt with billowy sleeves, a brown vest, blue fitted pants with visible stitching, and brown boots.
  • A red-orange sash or cloak is draped over the left shoulder and flows behind the figure.
  • The background is plain white, focusing all attention on the character.
  • The color palette is naturalistic, with earth tones and a splash of color from the feather and sash.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The illustration is rendered in a semi-realistic, painterly style with clear outlines and shading to suggest volume and movement.
  • No text, labels, or UI elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The figure is oriented facing forward and slightly to the left, with the right leg forward and left leg back, suggesting motion or readiness to lunge.
  • The rapier is extended upward and forward, while the buckler is held defensively to the left.
  • The feather on the hat curves upward and to the right, adding a sense of flair and movement.
  • The red sash flows behind the figure, enhancing the sense of action and direction.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys agility, confidence, and readiness for combat, typical of a swashbuckler or duelist archetype.
  • The dynamic pose, flowing garments, and detailed accessories emphasize the character’s flamboyant and skilled nature.
  • The plain background ensures the viewer’s focus remains entirely on the character and their equipment. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.128,t=0.347,r=0.520,b=0.985), with ID 52686e1f-0eb9-4286-a3a4-f0570c907f0c -->

**Compete Alone**  
It’s customary that each participant must compete alone  
and may receive no help from outside sources. However,  
some duels pit pairs of combatants against one another  
(either all together or as tag teams). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.230,r=0.907,b=0.313), with ID 2cfd7cf1-36f4-470d-abc0-b6c5f0b3fed3 -->

Limited Tools  
The participants agree to the tools, including weapons and magic items, before the duel starts. Most combat duels that don’t involve magic limit participants to melee weapons and prohibit the use of poison. Some duels forbid the use of polearms and other reach weapons. A spellcasting duel might agree upon a roughly equal number of magic items, and a cap on the power (in game terms, the level) of the items. Some spellcasting duels might prohibit certain types of spells, such as summoning or healing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.322,r=0.907,b=0.496), with ID 8d422f99-d4ae-4240-ba1d-b47b8b777257 -->

Duration  
Combat duels typically last either until first blood (hitting and dealing damage) or until one of the duelists is knocked out. Most duels allow a participant to yield, which means they concede victory to their opponent, though sometimes this could diminish their social standing. Duels of talent usually involve several equal turns in which the duelists display their ability. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.505,r=0.906,b=0.634), with ID 7a886bcc-dfe3-43e6-a5a5-31294c672e5c -->

Adjudication  
Most duels are overseen by a third party who ensures the duelists don’t break the duel’s rules—inadvertently or by cheating. Where duels are legal, this is typically a constable or magistrate. In other places, a cleric or other respected figure serves as judge. Typically the GM plays the judge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.643,r=0.905,b=0.757), with ID 14c7511c-0a0b-474f-ac41-876da585231c -->

## COMBAT DUELS
Unlike the other subsystems in this chapter, a combat duel
works almost the same as a normal combat encounter,
with a few exceptions. These rules require exceptional
focus between two duelists and a third-party arbiter, and
thus are not available in a normal combat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.766,r=0.904,b=0.863), with ID 2c8e989a-5b2d-4124-8345-eff2a776ad4a -->

## Initiative and Dueling Actions
Unlike in typical combat, the duelists roll initiative
checks at the beginning of each round of combat. Each
round the combatant can choose to use Deception, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.874,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID fdf079fb-7ccd-4f16-98a5-6ce82c053512 -->
