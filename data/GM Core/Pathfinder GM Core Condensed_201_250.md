Intimidation, or Perception when they roll initiative.
Because a duelist might act twice in a row, durations
that last until the beginning of a duelist’s next turn
might function oddly. A duelist acting second can choose
to avoid such abilities that turn, or can choose to act
second if they win initiative on the next round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.173), with ID 072a0d8a-2ab6-45d4-8309-9099931c2a41 -->

If the duelist is at least trained in whichever initiative
choice they pick, they gain the corresponding dueling
reaction that round: Bullying Press for Intimidation,
Deceptive Sidestep for Deception, or Sense Weakness
for Perception. Neither duelist is aware of what type of
roll the other used for initiative—surprise and the use of
dueling actions are a part of dueling strategies. Familiars
and companions, even when allowed in the duel, can’t
use these actions, nor can bystanders. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.173,r=0.473,b=0.312), with ID 53e836e1-11f4-4c80-a87b-98f9fcc7e283 -->

# SPELLCASTING DUELS
Like combat duels, spellcasting duels take place in encounter mode, but their rules are not available during normal combat. They are typically more organized affairs than combat duels. Many spellcasting duels prohibit any sort of combat but spellcasting. They typically have the duelists take turns casting a turn’s worth of spells, giving their rivals a chance to counter the spells if they can. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.075,r=0.863,b=0.206), with ID 76e4ad5e-124c-4215-833a-ae44a6cbdba0 -->

Initiative and Dueling Actions  
In most cases, each duelist rolls initiative normally and proceeds in that initiative order throughout the duel, unlike in a combat duel. Each duelist can roll an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check instead of Perception. If they are trained at that skill, they gain the tradition focus of that skill, which allows them to hone in on a magical tradition corresponding to the check they made for their initiative roll. They also gain the Dueling Counter reaction, which enables a duelist to counter their opponent’s spell if their tradition focus matches the tradition of that spell. They also gain the Change Tradition Focus action, which changes the duelist’s tradition focus to a different tradition. Familiars and companions, even when allowed in the duel, can’t use these actions, nor can bystanders. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.213,r=0.864,b=0.464), with ID 24353945-912b-4007-8d17-1392b3d4b66a -->

When mixing a spellcasting duel and a combat duel, use the initiative rules for combat dueling, but allow the duelist to roll Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion for their initiative checks. They still gain the Dueling Counter reaction and Change Tradition Focus action, though Change Tradition Focus is less useful in combat duels. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.464,r=0.863,b=0.573), with ID 37703cfb-6ce7-4c86-8fd4-c27658bf9ca2 -->

  • The soldiers’ armor and banners are consistent in style, suggesting a unified army.
  • The image is bordered by a green and gold frame, with the "Pathfinder GM Core" title at the top.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The knight is positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center, and is the focal point of the composition.
  • The army forms a dense line behind the knight, receding into the background and creating a sense of depth and scale.
  • Red banners wave above the soldiers, adding movement and visual interest.
  • The rocky ground in the foreground leads the viewer’s eye toward the central figure.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys themes of leadership, valor, and unity, with the knight as the heroic leader rallying the troops.
  • The use of perspective and lighting emphasizes the knight’s prominence and the scale of the army.
  • The consistent armor and banners reinforce the idea of an organized, disciplined force.
  • The dramatic sky and dynamic banners add energy and tension to the scene. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.005,r=0.996,b=0.520), with ID df12ab63-39d0-45a3-98bc-33b6f6c52b28 -->

# LEADERSHIP

*While many groups of PCs are isolated heroes who get the job done on their own, other groups enjoy gathering allies and building new organizations of their own. The leadership subsystem allows your PCs to do just that!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.131,t=0.537,r=0.910,b=0.627), with ID 6327af11-1cc8-4dc7-8649-22d4a93b9523 -->

Leadership is a long-term subsystem wherein one or more
PCs establish a fledgling organization and accumulate
followers over time. This subsystem provides a flexible way
to reflect the party’s growing influence in and connection
to the world around them through downtime events and
periodic benefits similar to those gained from joining
an existing in-world organization. The organization can
come into play only during downtime, or it can provide
adventure seeds or even play a major role in a campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.662,r=0.515,b=0.804), with ID 688ca74e-2c19-447b-94fd-28cd55eba1cb -->

## ORGANIZATION LEVELS
Every organization has a level from 1 to 20. Any organization below level 1 has no followers; it’s just an ordinary group of PCs. Unlike many other subsystems in this chapter, leveling up an organization in the leadership subsystem does not involve accumulating points. Instead, the process of growing the organization itself is what causes it to level up! As a reward for quests, roleplaying <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.811,r=0.515,b=0.942), with ID debb063a-031b-4dbb-a218-add6cb109027 -->

scenes, or succeeding at other subsystems (particularly
influence or reputation), the PCs can add an NPC follower
to their organization. At first, only a few level 0 NPCs
follow the PCs, but as the party builds up more followers,
they can also gain followers of higher and higher level, as
well as a small number of higher-level lieutenants to lead
groups of followers. Once an organization has recruited
enough followers, the organization itself levels up, which
increases the maximum level of followers, the number of
lieutenants, and the level range of those lieutenants. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.663,r=0.907,b=0.818), with ID af0aac71-19c1-4f79-931f-6cf668a1e367 -->

## BASE OF OPERATIONS
Beyond the very smallest organizations, PCs need some kind of base of operations the organization calls home. This allows the organization to function and grow in its intended role. For instance, if the PCs run a mercenary army, it might have a keep for training and as a base for defending the nearby area. While organizations <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.827,r=0.907,b=0.941), with ID 74e6f92e-b188-45c6-b197-52edb7315ad6 -->

Summary : This image displays a large, bold numeral "4" with a dark brown fill and a light outline, set against a textured, mottled tan background.

logo:
Main Elements :
  • The central feature is the number "4" in a thick, sans-serif style.
  • The "4" is filled with a solid dark brown color and outlined with a thin, light tan or cream border.
  • The background is a mottled, textured tan color, providing contrast to the numeral.

Design & Placement :
  • The numeral is centered within the image.
  • The outline enhances the visibility of the "4" against the background.
  • No additional text, symbols, or branding elements are present.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended as a simple, bold visual marker or icon for the number four, with high contrast for easy recognition. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.913,t=0.014,r=0.967,b=0.054), with ID 7b4e5128-ea74-4e85-867c-522e185c85c8 -->

usually gain a base of operations early in their existence,
they must have one by 6th level unless the story of the
organization demands otherwise. A base of operations is
not necessarily immobile; a caravan, circus, or flagship
(or fleet, for a larger organization) could serve well for
wandering organizations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.080,r=0.473,b=0.174), with ID 0635b6e8-aede-418e-8c5d-676b141ea92e -->

Organization NPCs  
Followers and lieutenants are noncombatant NPCs of the levels indicated on Organization Statistics by Level. When an organization has followers or lieutenants of several levels, most of them are at the lowest possible level. As a rule of thumb, an organization has twice as many NPCs of a given level than of the next-higher level. This allows you to quickly estimate the level composition of the organization’s members, but you can of course change the levels of various followers as much as you like. When the minimum level for lieutenants increases, either the lower-level lieutenants level up to the new minimum, or they become followers of more powerful lieutenants the PCs recruit, whichever fits best with the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.182,r=0.473,b=0.403), with ID 83e43d03-0c7a-4736-8206-6a571cf807a3 -->

Followers and lieutenants are loyal to the PCs and their
organization, working to maintain the organization, its
base of operations, and their own way of life. Because
of this work, PCs don’t need to pay for basic upkeep of
their base of operations or for expansions to house the
burgeoning activity as their organization grows in level—
the followers and lieutenants take care of all of that. But
similarly, these followers and lieutenants never get involved
in the PCs’ adventuring, nor do they provide a source of
free magic or labor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.403,r=0.474,b=0.558), with ID 48eabbf1-15b3-4015-92cf-e60e6d655cbb -->

Cohorts and New PCs  
While the followers and lieutenants who define an organization’s advancement don’t accompany the PCs on adventures, sometimes the organization is the perfect plot hook to introduce an NPC who will be traveling along with the party or a new PC hoping to join the party. For instance, if the PCs are running a mercenary army, a rising officer might become a new PC. Treat such NPC cohorts and PCs just like any other additional characters in the party, with an enriched story that ties them to the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.565,r=0.474,b=0.728), with ID d195365c-6488-4d1c-bf9b-cf85661958c2 -->

# Running Leadership
When running a game with the leadership subsystem, adding new NPCs who join the PCs’ cause becomes a type of reward you should grant the PCs consistently throughout the campaign. For a typical rate of growth, give the PCs enough followers for the organization to level up at roughly the same rate as the PCs. In some cases, you might want to vary that rate—sometimes drastically. Perhaps the 10th-level PCs have a 20th-level organization with top lieutenants nearly as powerful as the PCs, or maybe the PCs start gathering followers only at 15th level and start their organization from scratch as a 1st-level organization. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.734,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID e6ec2cc0-9f2c-4ea8-b7f2-03528128fb16 -->

**Leadership Events**  
During downtime, or over the course of long stretches of time when the PCs aren’t in downtime but their organization is operating in the background, you should periodically provide special leadership events. These are in addition to the events you would normally provide the PCs during downtime. These should generally be a good mix between the following three categories. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.443,r=0.863,b=0.571), with ID 02138cb2-0dec-489c-b239-a88c1cc9804f -->

Opportunity: An opportunity offers the PCs a chance to make a consequential decision that shapes the organization moving forward. For instance, the Aspis Consortium offers the PCs a deal to store their goods in the PCs’ mercenary fort. Accepting gives the PCs money, but they’ll have to deal with the consortium’s unsavory goods. Rejecting the proposal might upset the consortium, but it allows the PCs to show their priorities between conscience and coin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.572,r=0.863,b=0.694), with ID ed15ca26-412e-44bc-84d6-1c8752066362 -->

**Trouble:** Something’s gone wrong with the organization. Perhaps the thieves’ guild is dealing with a clever new guard captain and needs help from the PCs to stay safe. Typically the resources the PCs need to invest to solve the troubles should be less than the benefits the PCs gain from windfalls to ensure that the organization is providing a substantial benefit to the PCs, rather than simply evening out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.694,r=0.864,b=0.801), with ID 7f3aeb55-69cd-4d36-9870-22b69110fa8f -->

Windfall: The organization has received an unexpected benefit that helps the PCs. This is typically access to an uncommon option: perhaps the organization researched a new spell or discovered the techniques for an uncommon feat. However, it could be extra money or resources, clues for the PCs’ adventures, political prestige, or anything else you can think of. The players might even be able to suggest a few options for their followers and lieutenants to work toward to give you some ideas. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.801,r=0.864,b=0.940), with ID 3d995aaf-7304-4882-b5c5-c6696d84a6b5 -->

# HEXPLORATION

*Few activities epitomize adventure as much as pure exploration through an unknown wilderness. Leaving the city streets and trade roads behind and striking out into the unknown can test the mettle of the most experienced adventurers, but such efforts reward those seeking fantastical sites, natural resources, and unforeseen opportunities.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.079,r=0.909,b=0.185), with ID 29175d5b-2595-4289-ae3c-0156ea254f4f -->

While you can represent long, heroic journeys using
normal exploration, if you want something more detailed,
you can use the hexploration subsystem instead. This is a
method where the overland map is divided into individual
hexagonal sections of territory. During their exploration,
the PCs travel through and explore individual hexes,
finding interesting sites, secrets, resources, and dangers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.218,r=0.514,b=0.325), with ID c8499278-be16-438e-9e4c-2e30e32bef67 -->

The pace of travel is measured in days rather than
hours or minutes. This means choosing hexploration
activities are more akin to choosing downtime activities
than exploration activities. Each day, the PCs explore or
travel through a region of the wilderness measured in
hexes on a map to survey, discover resources, forage, find
sites, and reconnoiter potential foes and allies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.326,r=0.514,b=0.433), with ID d0784b26-ee53-400c-ab73-ce0157b942f0 -->

Hexploration is ideal for sandbox-style campaigns,
where the players are at liberty to set the course of
their own adventure. The GM populates a region with
interesting locations and situations that the players
explore in any order they see fit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.434,r=0.514,b=0.510), with ID 7c6ef07f-2a86-430b-873b-96afa1897fd1 -->

## DESIGNING THE MAP
The best way to map the area is with a hex grid. Each hex represents a discreet area 12 miles from corner to corner, which can be traveled across and explored in about 1 day even by slower-moving groups. Hexes track the distance the party travels while exploring and define the bounds of certain types of terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.521,r=0.513,b=0.632), with ID 17f2db41-7dd3-47b2-a2b0-0b31c43b3f9e -->

When designing your hex map, it’s best to have each
hex represent one primary terrain type. This doesn’t
mean that’s the only feature of the land in this hex, but
it is the predominant type and represents the challenges
of traveling across and exploring that hex. You can also
give your hex other elements: a river or a road might
snake through the area, or it could contain a castle, cave,
village, fort, or some other type of encounter setting. You
can quickly draw your map using just a few colors, some
basic symbols, and letters or numbers for reference. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.633,r=0.513,b=0.785), with ID 7830191a-699f-4ada-9387-fec96d9e1dd3 -->

But this is only the start. This detailed map is your
GM map, holding all the secrets for the PCs to discover.
Give the players a blank map that they can fill in as they
explore the wilderness hex by hex. The more they explore,
the more their map will look like yours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.786,r=0.513,b=0.862), with ID f1cd18cf-cc0c-4380-8e26-1cbc093abce0 -->

### Populating Hexes
When populating a hexploration map, keep in mind that you have little control over which areas the players choose to explore first—or if they’ll explore those areas at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.875,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID d04a8532-ea3d-427b-a7ca-c69085b7650e -->

Because hexploration leads to nonlinear, player-guided
play, consider providing hooks within encounters and sites
for them to explore in several directions from their starting
point. You can provide some direction by presenting
jobs like exploring a site on behalf of an NPC, escorting
travelers, delivering goods, or scouting a region for a local
noble. This typically leads to a set encounter (see below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.219,r=0.903,b=0.327), with ID 27bfdbbb-661a-4c62-ab6d-8a3f0a9c0ff8 -->

Set Encounters  
Even a sandbox adventure has a story or is the setting of multiple stories. Set encounters, be they just a simple encounter or an entire adventuring site, can serve as important beats in the story behind the PCs’ exploration. These are typically the points on the hex maps the PCs are searching for, and the discovery of one set encounter will often incorporate story points that lead to the next. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.339,r=0.904,b=0.463), with ID 89c60a62-22ef-4f45-9cc5-07cc507e57d6 -->

Random Encounters  
You can instill additional danger into your hexploration by including random encounters, whether they take the form of interesting features, natural hazards, or creatures native to the terrain. It can help to create a series of short lists in advance, each including a mix of three types of encounters: harmless, hazards, and creature encounters. Then create tables to randomize the results, or simply pick whichever encounter you think would work best for your hexploration narrative when these encounters occur (as described in Random Encounters on page 209). It’s often easier to create a list by terrain rather than for each hex. The forest hexes could have their own random encounter list while the plains beyond have a different list, possibly with some overlap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.477,r=0.903,b=0.692), with ID e8b5e3bc-c1aa-47ec-ac00-a2072833be7b -->

A harmless encounter is just that: the party is in no danger from it. Harmless encounters can be opportunities to flesh out the world with interesting bits of set-dressing, like a shrine on the side of the road dedicated to a minor god, opportunities for the party to interact with other travelers, or simply interesting or noteworthy moments on the road, like a distant and dazzling electrical storm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.695,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID 99da281f-8fdd-4e1f-9301-bdede4420573 -->

Hazard encounters can include those located in the Hazards section on pages 98–108, primarily the environmental hazards and haunts. You can also create your own hazards (page 109). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.802,r=0.903,b=0.862), with ID a2717c44-b01a-4684-97d9-d3151cb71839 -->

Creature encounters can use the creatures found in  
*Monster Core*, or you can create your own using the rules  
found in Building Creatures on page 112. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.864,r=0.902,b=0.907), with ID a99cdda6-47a6-4a3f-ae59-463b74535edf -->

Summary : This image is a hex-grid fantasy map showing a region with varied terrain, including forests, mountains, rivers, and a small lake, intended for tabletop or roleplaying games.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • Geographic extent covers a rectangular area divided into large hexagonal cells.
  • No explicit latitude/longitude or scale bar; orientation indicated by a north arrow in the upper right.
  • Terrain types include forest (upper left), mountains (upper right), grassland/plains (center and lower left), and a small lake (bottom left).

Keys & Annotations :
  • No visible legend or text labels.
  • Terrain is color-coded: dark green for forest, white/gray for mountains, yellow-green for plains.
  • Blue lines represent rivers and streams, with one river flowing from the mountains through the forest and plains to the lake.
  • Small black dots scattered across the plains may indicate settlements or features.

Ordering :
  • Terrain transitions from dense forest in the northwest to mountains in the northeast, with open plains and a lake in the southwest.
  • Rivers originate in the mountains, flow through the forest, and converge toward the lake.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for navigation or adventure planning, with clear natural boundaries and travel routes.
  • The river system connects the mountains, forest, and lake, suggesting a logical path for exploration or settlement.
  • The hex grid supports movement or distance measurement for game mechanics. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.057,r=0.875,b=0.524), with ID e72741ac-4d6a-4be6-b59f-90b6eb7c881c -->

current level, perhaps by creating a lower-level encounter
and including notes on how to scale it up. Alternatively,
if you want to run a more challenging or open-world
hexploration, don’t adapt to your players at all. Make a
variety of encounters, some of which are so powerful that
the correct tactic is to flee. You can even create a chase to
make the escape exciting (see Chases on page 192). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.540,r=0.472,b=0.650), with ID ee4ab551-cfcf-4563-bd79-0aa68d834c6c -->

Terrain  
While each hex should have a predominant terrain type, your terrain can come alive using the info in the Environments section on pages 90–97. A hex might also include a river or road. These can cut through the terrain, making it easier for the PCs to travel through the hex, so long as they follow the path. Additionally, each hex might have special features like resources and secrets (see the Types of Terrain sidebar on page 209). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.659,r=0.472,b=0.803), with ID f2b7c364-55db-45e6-abba-a6d773cce8a8 -->

Generating Random Hex Maps  
If you’d like to create your map randomly, begin by selecting a hex on a blank map as the starting point. Then decide the type of terrain for that starting point or roll it on the Random Terrain Type table on page 208. From that point onward, let the players decide which direction they travel. If they enter an unexplored hex, generate that hex by rolling 1d20 on the Random Terrain Type <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.811,r=0.473,b=0.942), with ID d4f58cf2-4019-4d3b-80e5-a6e45a5f06b8 -->

and Random Terrain Feature tables to determine a type  
and element for that hex. Apply common sense when  
producing terrain in this way. Unless magic is involved, it  
is unlikely a patch of arctic ice would appear in the heart  
of a desert—though figuring out a way for that to occur  
could lead to an interesting encounter or subplot later on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.539,r=0.864,b=0.635), with ID 4f4f028c-ed5f-4cf7-907c-60d899c154d6 -->

# Running Hexploration
Once you have your hexploration map ready, it’s time for the PCs to start exploring! Each day, the PCs decide how they plan on exploring, either learning more about their current hex or traversing a new hex. They do this by declaring one or more hexploration activities for the day. These activities take two forms: group or individual. The number of hexploration activities a group can accomplish each day is based on the Speed of their slowest member. If a group is willing to split up, faster members can perform more hexploration activities based on their own Speed, but such a decision may be deadly given the threat of random encounters. A group moving at a Speed of 10 feet or less is so slow it can’t even traverse an open hex in a single day; it takes such a group 2 days for each hexploration activity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.643,r=0.864,b=0.879), with ID c4f9412e-d81d-400b-bf0f-2bc3182f81e7 -->

This rate assumes the PCs are taking time to camp and
rest at healthy intervals. When a new day of hexploration
begins, the group can decide to take a forced march as long
as no one in the group is fatigued. Doing so allows them to <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.878,r=0.865,b=0.940), with ID 8b4b73e1-b306-4349-9e1d-21aea4d2e2b9 -->

gain an extra Travel activity (or perform a full Travel activity
each day if their Speed is 10 feet or less), but this is the only
activity they can perform that day. A character can participate
in a forced march safely for a number of days equal to the
character’s Constitution modifier (minimum 1 day). Any
additional days of forced march make the character fatigued

## Group Activities
Group activities require the entire party to work together in order to be effective; these activities each count as one of the day’s hexploration activities for the whole group. For instance, if the group had 2 hexploration activities per day and decided to Travel and Reconnoiter, no one would have any additional hexploration activities that day. There are two group activities: Travel and Reconnoiter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.659,r=0.513,b=0.787), with ID a5335614-a15f-4d42-9a70-8d97ea29366b -->

# TRAVEL

MOVE

You progress toward moving into an adjacent hex. In open terrain, like a plain, using 1 Travel activity allows you to move from one hex to an adjacent hex. Traversing a hex with difficult terrain (such as a typical forest or desert) requires 2 Travel activities, and hexes of greater difficult terrain (such as a steep mountain or typical swamp) require 3 Travel activities to traverse. Traveling along a road uses a terrain type one step <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.798,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID e26d772e-bc63-4159-aae4-23b0707211ea -->

better than the surrounding terrain. For example, if you are
traveling on a road over a mountain pass, the terrain is difficult
terrain instead of greater difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.081,r=0.903,b=0.126), with ID e9cbf196-1391-4afc-93e6-ce18858c9280 -->

The Travel activity assumes you are walking overland. If you are flying or traveling on water, most hexes are open terrain, though there are exceptions. Flying into storms or high winds count as difficult or greater difficult terrain. Traveling down a river is open terrain, but traveling upriver is difficult or greater difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.127,r=0.903,b=0.218), with ID 80dcd905-5263-47fe-a806-c48ea30c03b5 -->

## RECONNOITER

CONCENTRATION

You spend time surveying and exploring a specific area, getting the lay of the land and looking for unusual features and specific sites. Reconnoitering a single hex takes a number of hexploration activities equal to the number of Travel activities necessary to traverse the hex—1 for open terrain, 2 for difficult terrain, and 3 for greater difficult terrain. Traveling on roads doesn’t lessen the time required to Reconnoiter. Once the hex has been Reconnoitered, you can Map the Area to reduce your chance of getting lost in that hex (see below). You automatically find any special feature that doesn’t require a check to find, and you attempt the appropriate checks to find hidden special features. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.231,r=0.903,b=0.432), with ID 3840c0a6-f2d6-44a3-8bd1-f635ba7db0c5 -->

For instance, if you were looking for an obvious rock formation among some hills, you would spend 2 hexploration activities to Reconnoiter the hex, and you'd find the rock formation. But if you were looking for a hidden tengu monastery somewhere in some deep forests, after spending 2 activities to Reconnoiter the forest hex, you would have to succeed at a Perception check as part of your Reconnoiter activity to find the monastery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.434,r=0.903,b=0.556), with ID a06e33bb-1efe-4ae8-a8be-28446783a9df -->

**Individual Activities**  
Not all hexploration activities need to be accomplished as a group. In place of using a hexploration activity to Travel or Reconnoiter, each individual group member can instead perform one of these individual activities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.568,r=0.902,b=0.648), with ID d31715ed-6b3a-4a1a-9590-c06549e37222 -->

FORTIFY CAMP  
You can spend time fortifying your camp for defense with a successful Crafting check (typically at a trained or expert DC). Anyone keeping watch or defending the camp gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls and Perception checks to Seek creatures attempting to sneak up on the camp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.660,r=0.903,b=0.755), with ID fa6f1cf1-9579-4080-8604-92b3f4e0163b -->

MAP THE AREA

CONCENTRATION
As long as your group has successfully Reconnoitered the hex, you can use this activity to create an accurate map of the hex with a successful Survival check (typically at a trained or expert DC). When you have an accurate map of the hex, the DC of any check to navigate that hex is reduced by 2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.768,r=0.903,b=0.878), with ID 919f2cbd-685d-42d3-8c15-fd49f1080f23 -->

hours or less of exploration. Any skill feats or other abilities
that apply to Subsist normally still apply here. In general,
the various exploration activities found in the sidebar on
pages 438-439 of _Player Core_ (except Hustle) can be used
as individual hexploration activities, as can skill actions in
Chapter 4 of _Player Core_, at the GM’s discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.473,b=0.175), with ID f37c30a6-53f8-4b1d-af44-a4e7436e1707 -->

Random Encounters  
When exploring, there is always a chance the PCs will stumble upon random encounters, depending on the terrain. At the start of each day of hexploration, roll a flat check and consult the appropriate terrain type on the Random Encounter Chance table. If the flat check is a success, the PCs have a random encounter, and on a critical success, they have two random encounters. Roll on the Random Encounter Type table to determine the type of encounter. Once you know the type of the encounter, either choose from the list you made for that region or choose your own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.183,r=0.473,b=0.374), with ID 62552593-a05f-443f-8f6b-5b0877103bed -->

Switching out of Hexploration
Most short encounters do not affect the number of hexploration activities that the PCs can perform during the day, but when the PCs take on multiple encounters or engage in activities that take hours rather than minutes, you’ll want to deduct the time from their available hexploration activities. For the story’s sake, it’s best to think of hexploration activities as the various things that the PCs have time to do in the daylight hours. For instance, maybe the group spends 2 of their 3 hexploration activities Reconnoitering a hex, finding a tengu monastery, and learning that it is a sprawling complex underneath a small, wooded hill. You might decide that the PCs found it in the evening, and they have the choice between making a foray into the complex late in the day or pursuing some individual activities, camping for the night, and starting off fresh in the morning. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.673,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID 9a5091cb-f8b7-4623-ab82-a41ec4067b81 -->

Summary : This is a dynamic fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting a dramatic chase scene involving a horse-drawn carriage racing through a medieval town street, with two armored figures atop the carriage, one wielding a glowing magical staff.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: A horse-drawn carriage in rapid motion, with two armored figures on top—one standing and casting a spell with a glowing staff, the other seated and holding the reins.
  • Setting: Medieval/fantasy town street, with timber-framed buildings on either side and debris (barrels, crates, pottery) scattered in the carriage’s wake.
  • Perspective: Action-oriented, slightly low angle, emphasizing speed and chaos.
  • Composition: The carriage and horses dominate the foreground, angled from left to right, with the spellcaster elevated for prominence.
  • Lighting: Bright daylight, with magical glow effects from the staff and spell.
  • Colour palette: Earthy browns and tans for buildings and horses, contrasted by the blue and gold of the spellcaster’s attire and the magical yellow glow.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references.
  • No on-image UI elements or text, except for the “Pathfinder GM Core” title at the top.
  • Decorative dragon motif in the upper left corner, part of the book’s border design.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: Two horses (one tan, one black) pulling the carriage, with chickens and debris scattered in their path.
  • Midground: The carriage, with the two figures on top—one standing, one seated.
  • Background: Medieval buildings, angled to create a sense of depth and motion.
  • Action flows from left (chaos, debris) to right (forward movement of carriage and horses).

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys urgency and adventure, with the spellcaster’s elevated stance and glowing staff suggesting magical action or defense.
  • The chaotic street scene, with flying debris and startled animals, emphasizes the speed and disruption caused by the chase.
  • The composition draws the viewer’s eye from the chaos in the lower left to the focused action of the characters and horses, reinforcing the narrative of a high-stakes pursuit. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.004,r=0.996,b=0.521), with ID 8412e9e0-1fe5-4e92-8f52-408ced32bd28 -->

# VEHICLES

*A villain on the run steals a carriage and sends the characters on a chase through the city, or the characters find an ancient airship and decide to take it for a spin. Whatever the case if vehicles are common throughout your world, they’re likely to come up in your game. This section provides the tools you’ll need when that happens.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.130,t=0.533,r=0.919,b=0.649), with ID 600b3f8f-3ed8-4591-8758-bed5979bd42b -->

Vehicles can play many roles in a game. They might
simply be the means by which the party travels from
one location to another, determining only the Price to be
paid for passage. But a caravan wagon that gets attacked
becomes part of an encounter. In a pirate campaign, the
ship is both the party’s home and its primary weapon.

The majority of the rules in this section are for using
vehicles in encounters, but vehicles are also useful during
exploration and even downtime play. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.677,r=0.516,b=0.817), with ID 42e47b90-ed44-4bc0-89ab-001798350bc5 -->

## VEHICLE BASICS
Ultimately, vehicles are objects. They have object immunities (*Player Core* 269), and they can’t act. In addition to the statistics most objects have, vehicles have several additional statistics and abilities. Vehicles have a size like any object, but their spaces are more specifically defined. Vehicles also have specialized movement rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.826,r=0.515,b=0.942), with ID 0052b5b0-c903-4ea9-853c-9283b84f830a -->

**Size, Space, and Capacity**  
Vehicles have size traits, but they don’t occupy the same spaces that most creatures use. Instead, each vehicle has specific dimensions provided in its stat block. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.675,r=0.906,b=0.740), with ID 14beb156-1fc2-419e-8561-50a5da180950 -->

Most vehicles are Large or larger, and many vehicles
are made for the purpose of carrying cargo. Unless
stated otherwise, the amount of cargo a vehicle can
carry depends on its size, terrain, and propulsion. A
draft horse or similar creature can usually pull around
100 Bulk of goods consistently throughout the day, so
pulled vehicles can typically hold 100 Bulk per Large
creature pulling. Water vehicles, such as ships, have
limits that are more based on volume than weight; a ship
can hold upwards of 1,000 Bulk. Flying vehicles can
typically hold only 1/10 the Bulk of a water vehicle and
still remain airborne. The GM might rule that unique
or unusual vehicles can hold different amounts of Bulk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.741,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID 8d8ff53a-352b-464b-b4a6-a55196b1d3c2 -->

### Movement and Heading
A vehicle’s movement type is determined by the vehicle itself, while its movement each round is based on the pilot’s actions. Vehicles trigger reactions when they move, just like a creature does, as do the actions of the pilot and any passengers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.474,b=0.173), with ID df5edd65-1733-474d-b5d8-a07ffae3e967 -->

Creatures can rotate and turn freely, so when you play a creature, you usually don’t need to keep track of which way it’s facing. However, vehicles can’t turn on a dime, so when controlling a vehicle, you need to keep track of which direction it’s facing. This is called the vehicle’s heading. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.173,r=0.473,b=0.265), with ID 1bb1f6ce-78a6-4642-8918-83aed9cf893a -->

When a vehicle moves, it must move in the direction
of its heading—it can’t move backwards or sideways,
though it can turn gradually as it moves forward. Most
vehicles can turn up to 90 degrees for every vehicle
length they move forward. For example, a 10-foot-long
carriage could turn left in only 10 feet. A 100-foot-long
warship, however, would need 100 feet to make the
same turn; given the warship’s 30-foot Speed, turning
typically requires several actions’ worth of movement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.265,r=0.473,b=0.403), with ID 8bf1ada8-bc7a-4a8a-a1db-247dcfbe5c46 -->

Some rules specify that a vehicle must move in a straight line. This line is measured from the center of the vehicle’s front edge, and it can skew up to 45 degrees from the vehicle’s current heading. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.404,r=0.474,b=0.465), with ID 57f25623-b297-4592-a164-55c3bea0a83c -->

When using a vehicle in exploration mode, the
vehicle’s Speed determines its travel speed just like a
creature (for more information, see the Travel Speed
table on page 438 of Player Core). No Drive actions or
piloting checks are necessary to pilot a vehicle at these
speeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.465,r=0.473,b=0.558), with ID e6d4444b-8672-430e-b104-e39ae8bbb279 -->

**Propulsion**
Vehicles typically travel over land, on water, or through the air, and their Speeds indicate their terrain and movement types. But vehicles also have a form of propulsion—the way in which their movement is powered—and this propulsion often has additional considerations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.565,r=0.473,b=0.664), with ID 7bcb0c25-d1e3-4e74-b1e6-07fae04f22bb -->

There are five main types of propulsion: alchemical,
magical, pulled, rowed, and wind. A vehicle can
have more than one means of propulsion, though it
usually uses only one type of propulsion at a time. For
instance, a galley has both the rowed and the wind
propulsion traits, meaning it can sail when the winds
are favorable, but the crew can also lower the sails and
row the ship when necessary. The vehicle’s means of
propulsion informs the skills a pilot can use for piloting
checks (page 212), and some means of propulsion have
additional rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.664,r=0.473,b=0.833), with ID 3deb2681-774d-4d3a-a34c-7ee72e085de1 -->

Alchemical  
Powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents, controlled internal combustion, lighter-than-air gases, or steam, vehicles with alchemical propulsion tend to be powerful but have the potential to be wildly unpredictable. Alchemical vehicles can often be piloted using the Crafting skill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.841,r=0.473,b=0.944), with ID c08c5bb8-128e-47a0-80a1-276290f6278e -->

Magical  
Magically propelled vehicles are powered by spells, magic items, or an entirely magical engine. A magical propulsion system can be targeted with counteracting effects like *dispel magic*, using half the vehicle’s level rounded up for its counteract rank and a standard DC for the vehicle’s level for the counteract check. A creature can use Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion (depending on the type of magic) for a magical vehicle’s piloting checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.076,r=0.863,b=0.238), with ID a2e267f2-8f20-4d79-b261-4411ec7f747d -->

Pulled  
This method of propulsion is perhaps the most common, wherein a wheeled conveyance (such as a carriage or wagon) is pulled by one or more creatures. The Speed of the vehicle can never exceed that of the slowest creature pulling the vehicle. The creatures pulling the vehicle don’t act on their own; they instead act as part of the vehicle’s actions, and their movement as part of those actions triggers reactions just as it does for the vehicle itself and its pilot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.244,r=0.863,b=0.402), with ID 974b4fa7-17a2-47b5-88b7-50bef060b8a9 -->

When a pulled vehicle takes collision damage, so do the creatures pulling that vehicle (though they can typically attempt the basic Reflex saving throw to mitigate that damage). The death of one or more pulling creatures might damage or slow the vehicle, and it might cause the pilot to lose control. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.403,r=0.864,b=0.494), with ID 7db66c85-f4df-4f11-a87b-8d7b715ae194 -->

For a vehicle pulled by an animal or similarly
unintelligent creature, a pilot can use Nature for
piloting checks; for sapient pulling creatures, the pilot
can instead use Diplomacy or Intimidation for piloting
checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.495,r=0.865,b=0.572), with ID a82f81cb-9977-4b6b-9452-3d25b8de7082 -->

Rowed  
These vehicles are propelled by the power of creatures rowing the vehicle from within. The creatures rowing the vehicle act only as part of the vehicle’s actions, and their movement as part of those actions triggers reactions just as it does for the vehicle itself and its pilot (though rowers often have some degree of cover). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.582,r=0.864,b=0.694), with ID 9a1b327b-c070-42b1-a9ed-65369fadf175 -->

When a rowed vehicle takes collision damage, so do the
creatures rowing that vehicle (though they can typically
attempt the basic Reflex saving throw to mitigate that
damage). The death of one or more creatures might
cause the vehicle to go out of control or slow the vehicle,
but usually doesn’t damage the vehicle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.694,r=0.865,b=0.786), with ID ea2242b1-c6e9-40bc-a538-aaded2ef0785 -->

A pilot on a vehicle rowed by other people can use  
Diplomacy or Intimidation for piloting checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.786,r=0.865,b=0.818), with ID ca3f52fe-10ac-4f27-a1cd-ae469eb706e3 -->

Wind  
Wind-propelled vehicles require some form of air movement to power them, and adverse wind conditions can cause them to stall or even go out of control. Wind vehicles that rely on cloth sails typically have weakness to fire. Pilots of wind-powered vehicles can use Nature for piloting checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.827,r=0.865,b=0.943), with ID 9b4b52c4-13bc-4c42-86da-e53fb3fcef54 -->

PILOTING A VEHICLE  
In encounter mode, a vehicle moves on its pilot’s turn, and the pilot must use their actions to control it. A vehicle can take part in only 1 move action each round, even if multiple creatures Take Control as pilots on the same round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.075,r=0.517,b=0.160), with ID 405189ae-8042-41ac-9f23-40c34d6384f8 -->

## Vehicle Momentum
A vehicle in motion builds up momentum that keeps it in motion. Each round, if the vehicle has moved in the previous round, the pilot must either use another move action or Stop the vehicle. If the pilot does neither of these things on their turn (even if the pilot Delays), the vehicle continues to move and becomes uncontrolled, as described in Uncontrolled Vehicles on page 212. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.168,r=0.515,b=0.297), with ID 666b3d89-78b5-4af2-b3ad-0423b17f3241 -->

Piloting Checks
Many actions related to vehicles call for the pilot to attempt a piloting check. The skills a pilot can use for a piloting check are listed in the vehicle’s stat block, but most vehicles use Driving Lore or Piloting Lore along with others determined by their propulsion. The creature piloting a vehicle when an encounter begins can usually roll an appropriate piloting skill for that vehicle for initiative. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.306,r=0.515,b=0.433), with ID bafda8dd-8934-4f4a-aad4-cdc0c082dc0c -->

The GM sets the DC of the piloting check using a standard DC for the vehicle’s level, with adjustments based on the circumstances. Generally speaking, an action that would move a vehicle through difficult terrain increases the DC to a hard DC for its level, and moving through greater difficult terrain increases the DC to incredibly hard. Other factors, such as turbulent winds for a wind-powered vehicle, monsters threatening the creatures pulling a pulled vehicle, or rough seas for a water-based vehicle, could all increase the DC of a vehicle’s piloting checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.434,r=0.514,b=0.587), with ID f786c307-baf6-4d06-8e96-09976760b24e -->

Requirements You are adjacent to a point of entry on the vehicle you are attempting to board.
You board a vehicle through an open top, a door, a portal, or a hatch; if you're already on board, you can instead use this action to disembark into an empty space adjacent to the vehicle's point of entry. Using this action while the vehicle is in motion is challenging, requiring a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check with a DC equal to the vehicle's AC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.658,r=0.513,b=0.817), with ID 6d4fd6c4-82a2-4ea1-b73c-d2f6fb168074 -->

RUN OVER »»»

MOVE  RECKLESS
Requirements You are piloting a vehicle.
You try to run over creatures with your vehicle, possibly also ramming one larger creature or object. If you maintain control of your vehicle, the vehicle moves up to twice its Speed in a straight line at the vehicle’s current heading. You attempt to run over any creatures in your path two sizes smaller than the vehicle or smaller, and you can attempt to ram one target creature or object in your path one size smaller than the vehicle or larger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.261,r=0.904,b=0.417), with ID 4a38ea6c-f07b-4de4-a14e-c157ce4a9b3e -->

Each creature in your path, including a rammed target, takes the vehicle’s collision damage (basic Reflex save at vehicle’s collision DC). If the rammed target is a vehicle, its pilot can attempt a piloting check in place of this Reflex save, with the same results. If the target of your ram takes damage, you and your vehicle each take collision damage (no save) and your movement ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.418,r=0.904,b=0.510), with ID 233f210b-edd3-4a6f-9e80-bd8c22d25216 -->

TAKE CONTROL ◆
MANIPULATE
Requirements You are aboard the vehicle and adjacent to its controls.
You grab the reins, the wheel, or some other mechanism in order to control the vehicle. Attempt a piloting check; on a success, you become the vehicle’s pilot, or regain control of the vehicle if it was uncontrolled. Some vehicles have complicated controls that cause this action to become a multi-action activity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.597,r=0.903,b=0.739), with ID 1720f48c-8df1-49ab-9ba9-07bdb29aa7c7 -->

Reckless Piloting  
Actions that have the reckless trait push the pilot and the vehicle beyond the normal parameters for safe operation, and the pilot risks losing control of the vehicle. When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle, with the following effects. Resolve this piloting check before resolving the action itself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.752,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID c1807286-9f85-476d-badf-fb6fa406ac2d -->

Success The action occurs as described.
Failure The vehicle moves its Speed in a straight line along its most recent heading, drifting up to 45 degrees at the GM's discretion, and becomes uncontrolled. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.879,r=0.900,b=0.938), with ID bd85d297-3197-47be-b88b-70af89ac6ec9 -->

## Uncontrolled Vehicles
Some situations can cause a pilot to lose control of their vehicle. Most commonly, this is due to a failed piloting check for a reckless action, but it can also occur if a round passes without a pilot using a move action to control the vehicle or Stopping the vehicle. A vehicle can also become uncontrolled if the pilot becomes unable to act during a move action to control the vehicle. For example, if a vehicle’s movement triggers a Reactive Strike that knocks the pilot unconscious or paralyzes them, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.234), with ID 7c5a4be1-fa48-410a-bbf4-933a55425842 -->

An uncontrolled vehicle continues to move each
round at its most recent pilot’s initiative position. The
distance it moves each round is 10 feet less than on the
previous round, always in a straight line at its current
heading until it crashes or it comes to a stop. At your
discretion, it could slow down more if it’s on uneven
terrain, difficult terrain, on an upward slope, or facing
adverse wind conditions; by the same token, it could
stay at the same speed or even accelerate if it’s on a
downward slope or being pushed by strong winds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.234,r=0.473,b=0.387), with ID 53b772b7-be39-484e-ad9a-2dcc3bab21e3 -->

An uncontrolled vehicle in motion interacts with
obstacles, other vehicles, and creatures using the effects
of the Run Over action, except that the distance it moves
is dictated by the factors above instead of the Speed
specified in that action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.388,r=0.473,b=0.466), with ID 6215d237-1433-4fea-8b78-5983a283ec01 -->

## Vehicles in Combat
Whether driving a chariot in an arena or fighting off a boarding party, characters sometimes attack from a vehicle or target other creatures aboard a vehicle. Attacks made while on a vehicle that has moved within the last round take a –2 penalty, or a –4 penalty if the vehicle is uncontrolled or any action in the last round had the reckless trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.472,r=0.473,b=0.587), with ID 27cfbf2c-3729-4b19-b882-19e21999a1ab -->

While on a vehicle, a character might have cover from
certain angles of attack. A vehicle with sides but no top,
such as a chariot or a keel boat, usually provides lesser
cover, or standard cover from an attacker on the ground.
An enclosed vehicle, such as a carriage, provides greater
cover or may prevent attacks entirely. Breaking the vehicle
can reduce the cover it provides. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.586,r=0.473,b=0.694), with ID f766f852-66ad-4136-8c8f-1141da6178b3 -->

Some vehicles have special mounted weapons that can be used by the pilot or passengers. These are typically ranged weapons, such as a crossbow, and use the same rules as any other weapon, save that they might be able to target only creatures in a certain range or direction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.693,r=0.473,b=0.773), with ID 68959d4c-78cd-4498-b60e-f7de3a3abea5 -->

**Broken Vehicles**  
When a vehicle is broken, it becomes harder to use. It takes a –2 penalty to its AC, saves, and collision DC, and the DC of all piloting checks related to the vehicle increase by 5. The broken vehicle’s Speeds are halved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.780,r=0.473,b=0.862), with ID adc5f54a-7003-46a3-bbdf-4bf8a802d2f4 -->

A vehicle reduced to 0 HP is destroyed, like any other item.
If the vehicle is in water when it’s destroyed, it sinks; if it is
flying, it falls and everyone aboard takes falling damage. A
pulled or rowed vehicle that becomes wrecked, regardless
of which method of propulsion the vehicle is using at the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.862,r=0.474,b=0.941), with ID 6f72e205-3e2a-4385-bc5a-c67e00f4b6d5 -->

Summary : This is a colored illustration of an airship, showing a large patchwork balloon attached by ropes to a wooden ship-like gondola, with some descriptive text partially visible on the right.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a fantasy-style airship, consisting of a large, multicolored, patchwork balloon and a wooden ship suspended beneath it.
  • The balloon is depicted in shades of blue, green, yellow, and brown, with visible seams and patches.
  • The ship below resembles a classic wooden sailing vessel, with ornate details and a pointed bow.
  • The airship is shown in profile, angled slightly upward, suggesting ascent or forward movement.
  • Lighting is diffuse and even, with no strong shadows or highlights.
  • The color palette is muted, with earthy and cool tones dominating.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference is present.
  • The word "AIRSHIP" appears on a label at the bottom center of the image.
  • Partial text on the right includes: "UNCOM", "Price 1", "Space", "Crew 1", "Piloting", "AC 2", "Hard", "imm", "Speed", "2 La", "Collisi", and "SKY C".
  • The illustration is clean and stylized, with clear outlines and minimal background detail.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The balloon occupies the upper two-thirds of the image, with the ship suspended below by multiple ropes.
  • The ship is centered horizontally, with the balloon extending beyond the ship's length.
  • The ropes are evenly spaced, connecting the ship to the balloon at multiple points.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the fantastical and mechanical aspects of the airship, highlighting both the patchwork construction of the balloon and the ornate design of the ship.
  • The lack of background or environmental context focuses attention on the airship itself, making it suitable for use in a game manual or fantasy reference.
  • The partial text suggests this image is part of a larger informational entry, likely describing the airship's statistics or features. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.126,t=0.074,r=0.576,b=0.416), with ID 174a2f63-9e36-4a8f-a2db-1612c15f6155 -->

PULLING A SKY CHARIOT
Sky chariots naturally require flying creatures to pull them. Some options in Monster Core include giant bats, hippogriffs, griffons, drakes, and pterosaurs.

GALLOP
Horses and some other creatures have the Gallop action. When all creatures pulling a vehicle have this action, the pilot can take a –2 circumstance penalty to their piloting check for a 2-action or 3-action Drive to gain the circumstance bonus to Speed from the Gallop action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.073,r=0.862,b=0.280), with ID 12b64b7a-41d5-4bd5-9892-4aa73b33370b -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a "Heavy Chariot" with a dragon-themed design, featuring prominent blue and gold coloration and stylized wheels.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a chariot with a dragon's head motif forming the front and body.
  • The chariot is colored primarily in blue with gold or bronze accents.
  • The wheels are large, with stylized lightning-bolt spokes and a metallic finish.
  • The perspective is a side view, showing the full profile of the chariot.
  • The lighting is even, highlighting the metallic and painted surfaces.
  • The label "HEAVY CHARIOT" appears at the bottom in a gold-bordered banner.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • No visible background; the chariot is isolated on a plain backdrop.
  • The text "HEAVY CHARIOT" is in uppercase, white font on a gold background with a red border.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The dragon head forms the front of the chariot, with the mouth closed and eyes visible.

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a mechanical, four-legged robot labeled "STRIDER," depicted in a stylized, steampunk-inspired art style.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a quadrupedal robot with a boxy, rust-colored body and four long, jointed legs.
  • The robot's body features various mechanical components, including gears, coils, dials, and antennae emitting a zigzag signal.
  • The head area has multiple round lenses or sensors, a large circular light, and protruding cables.
  • The robot is shown in a dynamic walking pose, with one leg raised and the others supporting its weight.
  • The word "STRIDER" appears on a sign-like label attached to one of the front legs.
  • The background is plain white, emphasizing the robot's form and shadow.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or reference object for size.
  • Lighting is diffuse, with soft shadows cast beneath the robot.
  • Colour palette dominated by rusty reds, brass/gold, and steel blue tones.
  • No visible user interface or on-image text except for the "STRIDER" label.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The robot occupies the central foreground, with all four legs visible and spaced apart.
  • The body is elevated above the ground, supported by the long legs, giving a sense of height and mobility.
  • The antennae and cables extend upward and outward, adding to the sense of complexity and movement.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of mechanical ingenuity and mobility, with the "STRIDER" robot designed for walking on uneven terrain.
  • The steampunk aesthetic is reinforced by the use of exposed gears, coils, and a weathered, metallic finish.
  • The dynamic pose and shadow suggest motion and functionality, making the robot appear both practical and characterful. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.537,r=0.522,b=0.955), with ID 2c0d83f3-8778-4b0c-9c79-a91076034dbe -->

Summary : This is a detailed illustration of a small sailboat called a "cutter," shown from a side perspective on the water, with visible sails, rigging, and hull details. The image is accompanied by a text note about the "Sluggish" vehicle trait in a game context.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a single-masted sailboat (cutter) with a large mainsail and a smaller foresail.
  • The mainsail features a decorative pattern with a dark cloud and a yellow lightning bolt.
  • The boat is depicted in motion, with water splashing at the bow.
  • Perspective is from the port side, slightly above and to the front.
  • Colour palette includes natural wood tones for the hull, white and grey for the sails, and blue for the water.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit dimensions are provided.
  • The word "CUTTER" is labeled at the bottom center of the image in a stylized plaque.
  • The text above the sail reads: "Sluggish This vehicle must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes."
  • The illustration is clean and stylized, likely for a tabletop roleplaying game or similar context.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The mainsail dominates the right side of the image, with the smaller foresail to the left.
  • The cabin and deck are visible in the foreground, with the stern and rudder at the back.
  • The boat is angled as if turning or moving forward through the water.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the cutter's sail configuration and decorative elements, likely to aid in visual identification for gameplay or descriptive purposes.

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a group of adventurers in a treasure-filled dungeon, featuring a dramatic composition with four distinct characters, each with unique attire and equipment, set against a backdrop of stone architecture and piles of gold and jewels.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a group of four fantasy characters in a dungeon-like environment.
  • The foreground features a tall figure in elaborate robes and a crown, holding a staff adorned with antlers and red wrappings.
  • To the right, a kneeling character in studded leather armor holds a torch and is sifting through gold coins and gems.
  • Behind them, a bearded dwarf with a crossbow is poised, appearing alert and ready.
  • In the background, a blue-skinned, robed figure with a pointed hood and staff is descending stone steps, surrounded by mist or magical energy.
  • The setting is a stone-walled chamber or vault, with an arched doorway and steps leading down into the treasure hoard.
  • The color palette is rich and warm, dominated by golds, reds, and browns, with contrasting cool blue tones for the background figure.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with intricate costume designs, jewelry, and weaponry.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the torch casting a warm glow on the treasure and characters, and cooler, mystical light around the background figure.
  • No on-image text or UI elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The crowned figure with the staff is positioned centrally and in the foreground, dominating the composition.
  • The kneeling character is to the right and slightly behind, interacting with the treasure.
  • The dwarf is further back, aiming a crossbow toward the left.
  • The blue-robed figure is in the background, elevated on the steps, creating depth and a sense of impending action.
  • The treasure (coins, gems, and urns) fills the lower half of the image, emphasizing the dungeon’s riches.

Analysis :
  • The composition suggests a classic fantasy adventuring party encountering or defending a treasure hoard, with each character fulfilling a distinct archetype (mage, rogue, warrior, and possibly a magical adversary or ally).
  • The use of lighting and perspective draws attention to the central figure and the wealth, while the background character adds tension and narrative intrigue.
  • The scene conveys themes of adventure, danger, and the allure of treasure, typical of fantasy role-playing settings. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.001,r=0.999,b=1.001), with ID 6a0edee1-9f38-4c9f-b0d1-e84b1b675c2a -->

# CHAPTER 5:
## TREASURE TROVE

_Characters acquire treasure from the glittering hoards of their foes, as rewards for defending the innocent, and as favors from the grand personalities they treat with. As they progress through their adventures and improve their station in the world, characters collect ever more fabulous items, from enchanted armor and weapons to spell-infused wands and staves._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.074,r=0.864,b=0.203), with ID d88bfb13-578c-4028-bad5-c8d9f3d75324 -->

Treasure comes in all forms, from humble copper coins
to incredibly powerful, valuable magic items. The GM
controls the flow of items in the game as the PCs win
them through adventures, find them for purchase,
or acquire the formulas and skills to make the items
themselves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.231,r=0.472,b=0.326), with ID 503de2f2-30c7-4dd7-b9af-a212f859582e -->

Items can support characters by granting bonuses to
their statistics, allowing them to cast more spells,
and creating all sorts of effects that can't be
achieved in any other way. Magic items come
in many varieties, from enchanted swords that
can harm even incorporeal undead to containers
that can store a king's ransom within a tiny
space; many are permanent items
that can be used repeatedly.
Alchemical items, by contrast, are
not intrinsically magical and are
often consumed when used. Both
types have a variety of uses, from
curing the sick to lighting foes on fire.
Some treasures are neither magical nor
alchemical but are instead crafted from
precious materials or using specialized
expertise.

figure: Two ornate treasure chests, one gold and one silver, are shown in the upper right and lower right corners of the text. The chests are decorated with metal bands and appear to be filled with valuables. The images serve as decorative illustrations accompanying the text about magical and alchemical items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.327,r=0.477,b=0.601), with ID 57c762ca-1920-4701-8bf0-2c30c9f323b2 -->

This chapter provides rules for using different
kinds of items encountered in the game. Rules for
distributing treasure and creating treasure hoards can
be found on page 58. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.602,r=0.472,b=0.665), with ID c554d965-c26d-447d-8af5-99f7b1e3f4f7 -->

## Using Items
This section presents the rules for how characters use alchemical items, magic items, and other special items during play. Some items function automatically, while others need to be activated. While you need only swing a _flaming greataxe_ to scorch foes, you need to invest a _crown of intellect_ for it to work, imbibe an elixir of life to heal yourself, activate _clawed bracers_ to climb up a wall, and Cast a Spell using a magical scroll. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.673,r=0.471,b=0.819), with ID a8c5cccf-377e-48e3-8982-66a607296574 -->

CONSTANT ABILITIES  
Some magic items have abilities that always function.  
PCs don’t have to use any actions to do anything special  
(beyond wearing and investing a worn item or wielding  
a held item) to make these abilities work. For example,  
an everlight crystal always sheds light, and a flaming  
weapon deals fire damage every time it deals damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.827,r=0.471,b=0.942), with ID 39e60d04-c497-4a45-8706-e8f45d4b008a -->

# INVESTING MAGIC ITEMS
Certain magic items convey their magical benefits only when worn and invested using the Invest an Item activity, tying them to the PC’s inner potential. These items have the invested trait. Many invested items have constant abilities that function all the time or that always trigger when someone uses the item—but only when they’re invested. If a PC doesn’t have an item invested, these abilities won’t work. If an invested item can be activated, they must have invested the item to activate it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.230,r=0.863,b=0.402), with ID 18c12eb3-7a9f-470d-a95a-a1b5c3076f92 -->

A PC can benefit from no more than 10
invested magic items each day. Because this
limit is fairly high, and because it matters only
for worn items, you probably won’t need to
worry about reaching the limit until the
player characters reach higher levels,
when they’ve acquired many
useful magic items to wear. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.518,t=0.403,r=0.862,b=0.528), with ID 8e41dc48-3980-425a-b054-6c3e5f95d0e9 -->

A PC can still gain the
mundane benefits of an item if they
don’t invest it. A suit of +1 resilient armor
still gives its item bonus to AC when not
invested, but it doesn’t give its magical
bonus to saving throws, and winged sandals still
protect feet even though they need to be activated to
use them to fly. Entirely non-magical items don’t need
to be invested. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.525,r=0.862,b=0.663), with ID 002cad5a-4bba-49ca-9d15-8221ebfcf288 -->

INVEST AN ITEM  
You invest your energy in an item with the invested trait as you don it. This process requires 1 or more Interact actions, usually taking the same amount of time it takes to don the item. Once you’ve Invested the Item, you benefit from its constant magical abilities as long as you meet its other requirements (for most invested items, the only other requirement is that you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you remove the item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.674,r=0.860,b=0.816), with ID c7729ac3-bcea-4248-9ee0-098b0472af1e -->

You can invest no more than 10 items per day. If you remove an invested item, it loses its investiture. The item still counts against your daily limit after it loses its investiture. You reset the limit during your daily preparations, at which point you Invest your Items anew. If you’re still wearing items you had invested the previous day, you can typically keep them invested on the new day, but they still count against your limit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.817,r=0.860,b=0.940), with ID 2921a259-41e5-457b-b1ab-9cf6fb918179 -->

- • Item Categories
- Items are grouped into the following categories, shown here with the page number where those items appear and a brief description of the category.
- • Armor & Armaments includes rules for etching runes to enhance weapons and armor (page 224), armor runes (page 226), specific suits of armor (page 228), shields and the reinforcing rune (page 232), weapon runes (page 236), and specific weapons (page 240).
- • Alchemy items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Almost all alchemical items are consumable items that are used up when you activate them. This category includes bombs (page 244), elixirs (page 246), poisons (page 248), and alchemical tools (page 251).
- • Materials includes the statistics for standard items and structures along with rules for precious materials that can be used to make items with unique properties and other advantages (page 252).
- • Momentary Magic has a plethora of magical consumables, including ammunition (page 255), oils applied to the surface of objects and people (page 257), potions to drink (page 259), scrolls used to cast more spells (page 262), talismans affixed to items (page 263), and wondrous consumables of all sorts (page 268).
- • Trappings of Power are permanent and powerful. They include apex items that can increase an attribute modifier (page 270), companion items for pets (page 272), held items (page 273), magical staves for spellcasters (page 278), wands that can repeatedly cast more spells (page 282), and a vast collection of worn items (page 284).
- • Gems & Art Objects (page 298) make for an interesting variety of treasures.
- • Artifacts (page 300) are extraordinarily powerful magic items ideal to build adventures and plots around.
- • Intelligent Items (page 304) provides options for conscious items.
- • Cursed Items (page 306), used sparingly, can add danger and fun to items.
- • Relics (page 308) let you build a special item that unlocks new powers over time through the story of a campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.073,r=0.514,b=0.784), with ID 14c60824-0c39-4e18-a6ec-62cb92736b4d -->

# Activating Items
Some items produce their effects only when used properly in the moment. Others always offer the same benefits as their mundane counterparts when worn but have magical abilities that can only be gained by further spending actions. An activation lists the number of actions it takes and any traits of the activation and its effect. This information appears in the item’s Activate entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.795,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID d37b5e56-0a68-4c65-a565-8296cd594686 -->

If an item is used up when activated, as is the case for consumable items, its Activate entry appears toward the top of the stat block. For permanent items with activated abilities, the Activate entry is a paragraph in the description. This description usually has a name to indicate what’s happening when you activate it. Activations are not necessarily magical—for instance, drinking an alchemical elixir isn’t normally a magical effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.078,r=0.906,b=0.205), with ID e554e32e-9cdf-4d22-9c88-1e69bb29a139 -->

Activating Invested Items  
You can Activate an Item with the invested trait only if it’s invested by you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.213,r=0.905,b=0.266), with ID 319f0670-8a30-4e90-92c7-38a56bc984b7 -->

Manipulate Activations  
If an activation has the manipulate trait, you can activate it only if you’re wielding the item (if it’s a held item) or touching it with a free hand (if it’s another type of item). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.275,r=0.905,b=0.343), with ID 83cc6711-f9da-4257-8231-3dd398187e98 -->

Long Activation Times  
Some items take minutes or hours to activate. You can’t use other actions or reactions while activating such an item, though at the GM’s discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and you can’t activate them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you’re activating one, your activation is disrupted (see the Disrupting Activations sidebar). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.353,r=0.906,b=0.496), with ID e7bf6284-9266-4b86-a84b-da2d7e52d951 -->

Limited Activations  
Some items can be activated only a limited number of times per day, as described in the item’s entry. This limit is independent of any costs for activating the item. The limit resets during your daily preparations. The limit is inherent to the item, so if an ability that can be used only once per day is used, it doesn’t refresh if another creature later invests or tries to activate the item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.506,r=0.905,b=0.633), with ID 56f20eec-a8f6-410d-8e94-d8e70261a0ba -->

Cast a Spell  
If an item lists “Cast a Spell” after “Activate,” you have to use the same actions as casting the spell to Activate the Item, unless noted otherwise. This happens when the item replicates a spell. You must have a spellcasting class feature to Activate an Item with this activation. Refer to the spell’s stat block to determine which actions you must spend to Activate the Item to cast the spell. You essentially go through the same process you normally do to cast the spell but draw the energy for the spell from the magic item. All the normal traits of the spell apply when you cast it by Activating an Item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.644,r=0.905,b=0.832), with ID 20379cb6-d8e1-4d72-8106-937b4fbb7e2e -->

## Sustaining Activations
Some items, once activated, have effects that can be sustained if you concentrate on them. Sustaining an effect requires using the Sustain action (*Player Core* 419). If an item’s description states that you can sustain the effect, that effect lasts until the end of your turn in <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.843,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 247cf283-0ee1-4cd7-ae7c-4379c87ee28b -->

Summary : The image shows a large, bold numeral "5" with a beige outline on a textured, mottled brownish-yellow background.

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, dark brown font with a light beige outline.
  • The background is a textured, mottled pattern in shades of brownish-yellow.
  • The number is centered and occupies most of the image area.
Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar, magnification, or additional UI elements present.
  • No other text or symbols visible.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The "5" is centrally placed, with even spacing around it.
  • No foreground or background elements other than the textured backdrop.

Analysis : 
  • The image is likely intended to highlight or label the number "5" prominently, possibly as part of a sequence or for emphasis. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.902,t=0.014,r=0.973,b=0.056), with ID fe302109-1126-4fa6-8a13-74a7c0e24b27 -->

the round after you Activated the Item. You can use a
Sustain action on that turn to extend the duration. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.113), with ID 36cffd3f-6f46-4fe2-890d-27be0f221cda -->

Dismissing Activations  
Some item effects can be dismissed, ending the duration early due to you or the target taking action. Dismissing an activation requires using the Dismiss action (*Player Core* 419). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.121,r=0.472,b=0.204), with ID 4c21ba45-577f-40aa-83bc-3a00f5891cde -->

READING ITEMS
Hundreds of items lie ahead. Each item is presented in a stat block, much like spells or feats. The example below shows the structure of an item stat block and gives a brief description of each entry. Entries appear only when applicable, so not all items will have every entry described here. Detailed rules governing aspects of the stat block specific to items appear after the stat block. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.213,r=0.472,b=0.343), with ID aa0b099b-a9bf-44ec-bd48-0fddf559674e -->

<!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.351,r=0.472,b=0.447), with ID a48e27a1-24ad-405c-bea4-bda99d23b91b -->

Usage This entry describes whether the item is held, worn, or etched or affixed onto another item; Bulk The item’s Bulk is listed here (the rules for Bulk appear on page 269 of Player Core). Runes don’t have a Bulk entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.448,r=0.471,b=0.510), with ID 6efab6fd-83fe-4ed7-91b8-5995a60fd1b3 -->

Activate The number of actions needed to Activate the Item appear here, followed by any traits of the activation and effect in parentheses. You can find activation rules on page 220. This entry appears here for consumables and lower in the stat block for permanent items that can be activated. This section might also have Frequency, Trigger, or Requirements entries as necessary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.511,r=0.470,b=0.617), with ID 2f500dcc-6d5d-47e0-ade5-463e216ebdf5 -->

Onset This entry appears if the item's effect is delayed, which most often occurs with alchemical poisons. The onset is the amount of time that elapses between when a character Activates an Item and any effect occurs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.617,r=0.470,b=0.677), with ID c9be2b7a-0f2e-4adf-aabe-764dc66b2c85 -->

The section after the line describes the item and its constant abilities. If the item can be activated and doesn’t have an Activate entry above, that entry appears here in a paragraph beginning with “Activate.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.678,r=0.470,b=0.739), with ID 91976d08-96de-4da2-aae1-c43797a2dbe6 -->

**Type** If multiple types of the item exist, entries here indicate the name of each type, its level, its Price, and any other relevant details or alterations from the above description. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.740,r=0.470,b=0.785), with ID 2d374381-5e3b-4964-b128-3ac0cddbd590 -->

**Craft Requirements** An item that has special requirements to be Crafted details those requirements here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.785,r=0.469,b=0.817), with ID 68232720-49a8-41b2-8c3e-366f9f9d4ed2 -->

Level  
An item’s level indicates what level of adventurer the item is best suited for, but there’s no limit to the items a character can use based on level. A 3rd-level character who finds an item of 4th level or higher while adventuring can use it normally, and they can purchase the item if they can find it for sale and can afford it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.829,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID c28eea1d-e00c-4ae0-b650-9c5f8ceee180 -->

## NOTABLE ITEM TRAITS
The following traits apply to items. Some specific categories of item have special traits—such as elixir or scroll—described in their sections. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.092,r=0.848,b=0.156), with ID 37109785-1e0b-4747-be28-100394e04657 -->

**Alchemical:** Alchemical items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren’t magical, and they don’t radiate a magical aura. Characters can Craft these items only if they have the Alchemical Crafting feat (*Player Core* 252). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.157,r=0.847,b=0.233), with ID fe4d83d8-5fe3-49f8-b29b-8f22accd78f3 -->

**Consumable:** An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it's destroyed after activation, though part of it might be recoverable for other purposes. For instance, while a potion is consumable, the vial it comes in is not destroyed when you drink it. Consumable items include most alchemical items as well as ammunition, oils, potions, scrolls, talismans, and other magical consumables. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.235,r=0.847,b=0.356), with ID efdf5660-199e-4596-b830-9c894a50c784 -->

When a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity (*Player Core* 236). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.357,r=0.845,b=0.402), with ID dfbdfa9c-dc09-4033-a3f0-c0c0b304859f -->

**Focused:** An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn't count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can't gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items, no matter how many focused items you have. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.403,r=0.845,b=0.509), with ID b3d2a5ee-3b68-4488-a84f-c0f8780722e3 -->

**Invested:** A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off a character’s head). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.510,r=0.846,b=0.601), with ID 4424c81c-4073-4298-bb7f-6b671f13897a -->

**Magical:** Items with this trait are imbued with magical energies. A character can craft these items only if they have the Magical Crafting feat (*Player Core* 258). Some items are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicates that the item is magical. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.603,r=0.847,b=0.709), with ID e0259767-27c4-4591-8415-36b850cbf86a -->

When making items, a character can Craft only items whose level is equal to or lower than their own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.740,r=0.859,b=0.770), with ID 23f4f70a-3e7f-4cda-bd5f-b4e333252785 -->

Multiple Types  
If multiple types of an item exist, the title line gives the minimum level followed by a plus symbol (“+”). The description includes information on the base version of the item, and the Type entries at the bottom of the stat block lists the specifics for each version, including the level, Price, and any modified or added abilities of the different types. For some items, the types listed are upgrades to the base item. For other items, such as *aeon stones*, each type is distinct from the others. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.783,r=0.860,b=0.938), with ID 4eda5a6a-292b-44a9-903b-a7e0a0c681e6 -->

Summary : This image shows a stylized, symmetrical decorative motif with abstract shapes and a central diamond, likely used as an ornamental border or divider.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The design features a central diamond shape outlined in tan, flanked on both sides by mirrored abstract forms resembling arches or stylized human figures with circular heads.
  • The background is a dark green on the upper half and dark brown on the lower half, with the motif rendered in tan and brown.
  • The composition is symmetrical along the vertical axis, with the central diamond as the focal point.

Technical Details :
  • No text, scale bar, or numeric information is present.
  • The motif uses solid fills and outlines, with smooth curves and pointed angles.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The central diamond is positioned at the top center, with the abstract forms curving outward and upward on each side.
  • The motif occupies the upper portion of the image, suggesting it is a border or header element.

Analysis :
  • The symmetrical, ornamental design and use of earthy colours suggest a decorative purpose, possibly for framing or embellishing a document, page, or sign. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.898,t=0.920,r=0.999,b=0.958), with ID 509c4261-07e9-4b06-87dd-d227feb17abd -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the Pathfinder GM Core book, depicting two goblin-like adventurers exploring an icy cave with the skull of a massive dragon embedded in the ice.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are two goblin-like creatures in an ice cave.
  • The foreground goblin is heavily equipped with gear, wearing goggles, and is examining or extracting something glowing from the ice using a tool.
  • The background goblin is sitting or crouching on a ledge, partially obscured by mist and distance.
  • The cave is filled with icicles, stalactites, and a large dragon skull partially encased in ice, dominating the center of the composition.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with a warm orange glow from the goblin’s activity contrasting with the cold blue tones of the cave.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • No on-image text except for the "Pathfinder GM Core" branding at the top.
  • The illustration uses a painterly digital art style with high detail on the goblins and the dragon skull.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The foreground goblin is positioned to the right, close to the viewer, and illuminated by the glowing object.
  • The background goblin is to the left, farther away, and less detailed.
  • The dragon skull runs diagonally through the center, creating depth and leading the eye from foreground to background.
  • The composition uses rule-of-thirds, with the main action in the lower right and the secondary figure in the upper left.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of adventure, danger, and discovery, with the goblins exploring a mysterious and possibly perilous environment.
  • The contrast between the warm and cool lighting emphasizes the focus on the goblin’s activity and the cold, forbidding nature of the cave.
  • The presence of the dragon skull suggests a history or backstory to the location, adding narrative depth to the scene. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.007,t=0.011,r=0.994,b=0.518), with ID 702c8ff0-81fe-4543-a55d-e71f4948799b -->

**Price**
If an item is available for purchase, a character can typically buy it for the listed Price, and the character uses this Price when they use the Craft activity to make the item. If a character wants to sell an item, they can sell it for half its Price (or full Price, if they made the item for someone else on commission), assuming they’re able to find a buyer. The GM determines whether a buyer is available. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.535,r=0.515,b=0.680), with ID cae2744d-4c70-4dfd-820f-7c15864b927d -->

Usage
An item’s stat block includes a Usage entry that indicates whether a character must be holding or wearing the item in order to use it, or whether they instead must have it etched or affixed onto another item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.689,r=0.515,b=0.772), with ID a0489563-54cd-42c1-910c-4d89d15c3659 -->

Affixed  
Talismans function only if affixed to other items. They have a Usage entry indicating the type or types of items to which a character can attach them, such as “affixed to armor.” Rules for affixing a talisman are on page 263. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.782,r=0.514,b=0.864), with ID c9fc421f-f46f-462f-bad5-c5bf8fb56073 -->

Etched  
Runes must be etched onto permanent items, such as armor, shields, weapons, or *runestones* (found on page 269) to grant their benefit. Adding or transferring a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.874,r=0.514,b=0.942), with ID 28e9a7ce-7d9e-4593-b19a-2f986ebf9fef -->

rune takes downtime to accomplish. The Usage entry
indicates the type or types of items a rune can be etched
into, such as “etched onto a weapon.” More information
about etching runes is on page 225. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.540,r=0.905,b=0.603), with ID 9497ddb4-2448-465f-ae23-bacddf838a5a -->

Held  
If a character must wield the item to use it, this entry in the item’s stat block lists the word “held” along with the number of hands the character must use when wielding the item, such as “held in 1 hand.” The rules for carrying and using items are provided on page 267 of Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.614,r=0.905,b=0.724), with ID a507e514-e4bb-43b6-ba7d-4d1555d1350d -->

Worn  
An item that needs to be worn to function lists “worn” as its usage. This is followed by another word if the character is limited to only one of that type of item. For instance, a character can wear any number of rings, so the entry for a ring would list only “worn.” However, if the Usage entry were “worn cloak,” then a character couldn’t wear another cloak on top of that one. It’s assumed that items are meant to be worn by humanoids; any item that can or must be worn by a different type of creature either states this in its description or has the companion trait. Most magic items a character must wear have the invested trait, as described on page 219. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.736,r=0.905,b=0.940), with ID 5f11926c-5db5-41ed-9d02-46a97ba79957 -->

Summary : This image shows a large, bold, dark brown number "5" with a light tan outline, centered on a textured, mottled gold background.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, sans-serif font.
  • The number is dark brown with a light tan border.
  • Background is a mottled, textured gold color.
  • The number is centered in the image.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or additional text.
  • No visible UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "5" occupies the central area, with even spacing around it.
  • No foreground or background objects other than the number and the background texture.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely decorative or used as a label, with high contrast between the number and the background for visibility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.907,t=0.012,r=0.972,b=0.054), with ID 3cb87a35-dae6-4746-831f-8ea2ade44315 -->

Craft Requirements  
An item might require the crafter to provide specific raw materials, supply spells, or meet other special requirements to Craft it. These appear in the Craft Requirements entry of the stat block. Any of these Craft Requirements are in addition to the normal requirements for crafting the item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.072,r=0.475,b=0.177), with ID ee36074e-e081-4743-b4e1-54856b577624 -->

- **Crafting Items**
- In addition to anything special noted in the Craft Requirements entry, every item has default requirements. These are as follows, including anything listed in the Craft activity (*Player Core* 236).
  - The **crafter’s level** must be equal to or higher than the item’s.
    - If the item is **9th level or higher**, the crafter must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s **16th or higher**, the crafter must be legendary.
  - The crafter must have the **formula** for uncommon or rarer items.
  - The crafter must have an appropriate **set of tools** and, in many cases, a workshop.
  - The crafter must supply **raw materials worth at least half of the item’s Price**.
  - For an **alchemical item**, the crafter must have the Alchemical Crafting feat (*Player Core* 252).
  - For a **magic item**, the crafter must have the Magical Crafting feat (*Player Core* 258). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.182,r=0.477,b=0.498), with ID fa97c57d-73c1-4a49-bd3c-3a78259b89b6 -->

Runes  
Etching a rune largely follows the same process as Crafting items, though runes can be transferred and follow some other special rules detailed on page 225. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.504,r=0.475,b=0.575), with ID 0f266c7a-3108-4733-af75-d9903e5a6f6d -->

Multiple Types  
Some items with multiple type entries get special treatment when it comes to formulas and upgrades. The existing knowledge you have about the item means you don’t need to start from scratch with these items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.581,r=0.475,b=0.664), with ID b6870a4e-34ea-49d2-8483-4f59bb723097 -->

If you have the formula for an item, you don’t need a different formula to Craft a different type of that item that’s just a higher-level upgrade. For example, if you have the formula for a *+1 weapon potency rune*, you don’t need to secure a new formula to etch a *+2 weapon potency rune*. This works similarly with items such as a *spacious pouch* with its multiple types or *doubling rings* with a base version and greater version. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.664,r=0.475,b=0.786), with ID 89714f72-3b73-4193-acf2-a74a13f4cd20 -->

You can also upgrade an item or rune to a stronger
version. This essentially means you Craft a permanent item
from a lower-level version of the same item. For example,
you might upgrade +1 weapon potency rune to a +2
weapon potency rune or upgrade a spacious pouch type I
to a spacious pouch type II. The cost for this upgrade is the
full difference in Price between the items, and the Crafting
check uses a DC for the item’s new level. You don’t have to
upgrade step by step either! You could upgrade a spacious
pouch type I directly to type III or type IV. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.787,r=0.476,b=0.944), with ID 56c11aaf-1920-423e-8db0-91d4719b935f -->

## DISRUPTING ACTIVATIONS
Some abilities and effects can disrupt the process of Activating an Item. If something disrupts your item activation, you fail to Activate the Item and lose the actions you committed. If the item can be activated only a certain number of times per day, the failed activation still counts against that limit. If an item requires you to spend actions to Sustain an Activation, and one of those actions is disrupted, the item's effect ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.492,t=0.080,r=0.859,b=0.240), with ID b97acdce-0b77-4d42-bff8-9a4068fccd6b -->

## ITEM RARITY
Like many other aspects of the rules, items have rarities. Player characters might find uncommon magic items for sale, but only infrequently and often by private sellers or in clandestine markets. Their formulas are often guarded and not readily available. Unless the GM decides otherwise, a character cannot purchase rare items, and their formulas are lost to time.

Rarities for uncommon and rare treasures are indicated by the first trait in the stat block (or by the items’ level if only some types of the item have a different rarity). Unique items are indicated in the same way, though there are none in this book. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.494,t=0.243,r=0.858,b=0.449), with ID c6614369-6669-460a-9ad9-c16546c65651 -->

If the different types in an item entry are wildly different,
such as with *aeon stones* or *marvelous miniatures*, you need
separate formulas and can’t directly upgrade the items. If a
type of the item has a higher rarity, that type requires its own
formula. The GM will make the determination if it’s unclear
and might bypass these rules in special circumstances or if it
suits the theme of their game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.476,r=0.864,b=0.590), with ID ed386689-ddba-4254-a103-2bc99f45662f -->

# Important Items
Some magical items in the game are an important part of the game’s progression, so ensure your players are getting enough of the following items.

- • **Fundamental runes.** *Potency runes* for weapons and armor, resilient runes for armor, *reinforcing runes* for shields, and *striking runes* for weapons are all important to ensure characters have the attacks, damage, and defenses suited to their level. Read more about these runes starting on page 225.
- • **Skill items.** Players seeking true mastery of a skill will be happy to get items that give bonuses to that skill. These are mostly in the categories of held items (pages 273–283) and worn items (pages 284–297).
- • **Spellcaster items.** A staff is as important to a spellcaster as a magic sword is to a fighter. Learn more about staves on page 278. Scrolls and wands (pages 262 and 282) provide extra spells in a more limited capacity.
- • **Weapon alternatives.** Characters using unarmed attacks need *handwraps of mighty blows* (page 290) or similar items instead of weapon runes.
- • **Healing potions.** Keep them alive on page 259! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.596,r=0.868,b=0.947), with ID 67c88ae3-6082-494b-a6ed-9aa80a8039f4 -->

Summary : This image shows a stylized, symmetrical decorative motif with two abstract human-like figures on either side of a central diamond shape, rendered in gold lines against a dark green and brown background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a geometric, ornamental design.
  • Two abstract, circular-headed figures with raised arms flank a central diamond shape.
  • The motif is outlined in gold on a dark green upper background and a dark brown lower background.
  • The design is symmetrical along the vertical axis.

Technical Details :
  • No text, scale bar, or numeric information present.
  • The lines are smooth and uniform in thickness.
  • No photographic or realistic elements; purely graphic.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The diamond shape is centered at the top, with the two figures mirrored on either side.
  • The figures' arms curve upward and inward toward the diamond.
  • The motif occupies the upper portion of the image, with the lower part filled by a solid dark brown area.

Analysis :
  • The image is decorative, possibly intended as a border or emblem.
  • The symmetry and abstract human forms suggest a ceremonial or formal theme.
  • The use of gold and dark colors gives a sense of elegance or tradition. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.920,r=1.000,b=0.958), with ID 6478466c-805a-4a7a-8ebf-dca95f490985 -->

# ARMOR & ARMAMENTS

*Magical weapons and armor are important tools for warriors, even those who do their best to stay out of life-or-death battles. Whether empowered by runes or the subject of mysterious enchantments, they can markedly increase a character’s power in combat.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.076,r=0.910,b=0.172), with ID 1b434ba6-2e40-4895-b9f1-a12445c0c47d -->

## RUNES
Most magic weapons and armor gain their enhancements
from potent eldritch runes etched into them. These runes
allow for in-depth customization of items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.198,r=0.514,b=0.264), with ID d401eac9-3f31-4db1-8a86-2737319d37b9 -->

Runes must be physically engraved on items through a
special process to convey their effects. They take two forms:
fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental
runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: a *weapon
potency* rune adds a bonus to a weapon’s attack rolls,
and the *striking* rune adds extra weapon damage dice. An
*armor potency* rune increases the armor’s item bonus to
AC, and the *resilient* rune grants a bonus to the wearer’s
saving throws. A *reinforcing* rune increases a shield’s
durability. Property runes, by contrast, grant more varied
effects—typically powers that take effect each time the
weapon is used or that are constant while the armor is
worn, such as a rune that grants energy resistance or one
that adds fire damage to a weapon’s attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.265,r=0.515,b=0.479), with ID b3f847a3-4f27-4599-b6e6-78c7ad8ffff1 -->

The number of property runes a weapon or armor can have is equal to the value of its potency rune. A +1 weapon can have one property rune, but it could hold another if the +1 weapon potency rune were upgraded to a +2 weapon potency rune. Since the striking and resilient runes are fundamental runes, they don’t count <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.480,r=0.516,b=0.573), with ID 24c35b4e-2ea3-4dbf-afeb-8d2085e96c79 -->

against this limit. A shield can’t have property runes,
only a *reinforcing* rune. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.204,r=0.905,b=0.234), with ID 03fc815e-2193-4dc1-ad22-de0490e281c8 -->

An item with runes is typically referred to by the value of its potency rune, followed by any other fundamental runes, then the names of any property runes, and ends with the name of the base item. For example, you might have a +1 longsword or +2 greater resilient fire-resistant chain mail.

Rune-etched items have the same Bulk and general characteristics as the non-magical version unless noted otherwise. The level of an item with runes etched onto it is equal to the highest level among the base item and all runes etched on it; therefore, a +1 striking mace (a 4th-level item) with a frost rune (an 8th-level rune) would be an 8th-level item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.235,r=0.906,b=0.418), with ID fcfc6400-10e7-4d7f-b025-3f68f77a2ec3 -->

Each rune can be etched into a specific type of armor,
shield, or weapon, as indicated in the Usage entry of the
rune’s stat block. Explorer’s clothing can have armor
runes etched on it even though it’s not armor, but because
it’s not in the light, medium, or heavy armor category, it
can’t have runes requiring any of those categories. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.419,r=0.907,b=0.512), with ID 58c0fce8-94ba-4b70-a47c-f00eaa774bcd -->

**Investiture**  
If a suit of armor has any runes, it has the invested trait, requiring you to invest it to get its magical benefits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.520,r=0.905,b=0.575), with ID 85ca5db6-4fe7-44d8-bf18-5ceca1fa84ac -->

Summary : This image shows a large, bold, stylized numeral "5" with a dark brown fill, a light tan outline, and a textured tan background.

logo: 
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, sans-serif style.
  • The "5" is centered on a mottled tan background.
  • The number is filled with a dark brown color and outlined with a lighter tan border.
Technical Details : 
  • No company name, tagline, or additional text is visible.
  • No other graphic elements, icons, or symbols are present.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The "5" occupies most of the image area, with even margins on all sides.
  • The background texture is uniform and does not contain any distinguishing marks.

Analysis : 
  • The design emphasizes the numeral "5" as a standalone visual element, possibly for branding, labeling, or decorative purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.910,t=0.016,r=0.967,b=0.053), with ID 999623de-1697-4b05-bcee-8de6847c0703 -->

Rune Formulas  
The Price of a rune’s formula is the same as the Price of a formula for an item of the same level; it can be acquired in the same way as an item formula (*Player Core* 294). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.074,r=0.471,b=0.145), with ID bd1abee1-142a-4e06-a672-4ff082c05c35 -->

The Etching Process  
Etching a rune onto an item follows the same process as using the Craft activity to make an item. You must be able to Craft magic items, have the formula for the rune, have the item you’re adding the rune to in your possession throughout the etching process, and meet any special Craft Requirements. The rune has no effect until you complete the Craft activity. You can etch only one rune at a time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.152,r=0.472,b=0.282), with ID 0cc643e2-0fbf-40eb-ac91-2338ef8384b8 -->

Transferring Runes
You can transfer runes between two items. This uses the Craft activity, and you must be able to craft magical items. You can either move one rune from one item to another or swap a rune on one item with a rune on the other item (which can be a runestone; page 269). To swap, the runes must both be fundamental runes or both be property runes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.291,r=0.471,b=0.402), with ID 8cf8abf1-6dfc-43ba-89e9-78076a7d70ca -->

If an item can have two or more property runes, you
decide which runes to swap and which to leave when
transferring. If you attempt to transfer a rune to an item
that can’t accept it, such as transferring a melee weapon
rune to a ranged weapon, you get an automatic critical
failure on your Crafting check. If you transfer a potency
rune, you might end up with property runes on an item
that can’t benefit from them. These property runes go
dormant until transferred to an item with the necessary
potency rune or until you etch the appropriate potency
rune on the item bearing them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.403,r=0.471,b=0.570), with ID b3fbc00a-840c-4d17-8422-b9b4320f93ab -->

The DC of the Crafting check to transfer a rune is
determined by the item level of the rune being transferred,
and the Price of the transfer is 10% of the rune’s Price,
unless transferring from a runestone, which is free. If you’re
swapping, use the higher level and higher Price between the
two runes to determine these values. It takes 1 day (instead
of the 4 days usually needed to Craft) to transfer a rune or
swap a pair of runes, and you can continue to work over
additional days to get a discount, as usual with Craft. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.571,r=0.471,b=0.709), with ID 789f4b58-73b3-4a2c-bab7-6c573d4d3865 -->

## Fundamental Runes
Five fundamental runes produce the most essential magic of protection and destruction: _armor potency_ and _resilient_ runes for armor (page 226), the _reinforcing_ rune for shields, and _weapon potency_ and _striking_ runes for weapons (page 232). A potency rune is what makes a weapon a _runic weapon_ (page 240) or armor _magic armor_ (page 229). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.720,r=0.470,b=0.846), with ID 9fad909b-1cec-4ec0-a168-2f8c1ae7a438 -->

An item can have only one fundamental rune of each type, though etching a stronger rune can upgrade an existing rune to the more powerful version (as described in each rune’s entry). As you level up, you typically alternate between increasing an item’s potency rune and its striking or resilient rune when you can afford to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.848,r=0.470,b=0.938), with ID c1436639-7a06-42b0-bdaf-f695fc528ff2 -->

## RUNE TRANSFER EXAMPLES
You could transfer a _flaming_ rune from a +1 _striking flaming greatsword_ to a +2 _striking longsword_, resulting in a +2 _striking flaming longsword_ and a +1 _striking greatsword_. You could swap the _weapon potency_ runes from a +1 _longsword_ and a +2 _greatsword_, resulting in a +2 _longsword_ and a +1 _greatsword_. However, you couldn’t swap a +1 _weapon potency_ rune from one weapon with a _flaming_ property rune from another weapon, as the two runes don’t have the same form. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.083,r=0.851,b=0.249), with ID 5ddb2803-b780-4f0b-974e-769a654497ec -->

When transferring a rune to an item that can hold multiple property runes, you can decide whether you transfer a single rune or swap runes between the items. For example, a +2 weapon can hold two property runes. If you transferred a flaming rune from a +1 striking flaming rapier to a +2 striking frost warhammer, you would decide whether you wanted to end up with a +1 striking rapier and a +2 striking flaming frost warhammer or a +1 striking frost rapier and a +2 striking flaming warhammer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.250,r=0.848,b=0.389), with ID 9850283d-3d76-4575-a5c2-077ea04a7da3 -->

## UPGRADING RUNES
You’ll often want to upgrade the fundamental runes of magic armor, a magic shield, or a magic weapon you already have. This requires upgrading each rune separately, using the upgrading process described on page 223. These tables summarize the Price of each step, with a number in parentheses indicating the item’s level for the Craft activity. This follows the typical progression for an adventurer when upgrading their armor and weapons. The tables here don’t include progressions that aren’t as likely to come up, like turning a +1 weapon directly into a +1 greater striking weapon. You can upgrade reinforcing runes on shields and property runes that have multiple types as normal, but they aren’t listed on the table because their progression is more straightforward. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.399,r=0.847,b=0.632), with ID aa4cebf3-d531-4775-aa70-d1551521c1e1 -->

## SPECIFIC ARMOR AND WEAPONS
Unlike armor and weapons enhanced with runes, specific armor and weapons (such as _moonlit chain_ or a _bloodletting kukri_) are created for a specific purpose and can work quite differently from other items of their type. Specific magic armor and weapons can’t gain property runes, but you can add or improve their fundamental runes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.644,r=0.850,b=0.756), with ID 566b1437-329f-49d5-89b6-a73d05639ccb -->

Property Runes
Property runes add special abilities to armor or a weapon in addition to the item’s fundamental runes. If a suit of armor or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.782,r=0.860,b=0.907), with ID cb68ed36-2978-452e-9b35-981ec90da340 -->

Rune abilities that must be activated follow the rules  
for activating magic items on page 220. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.909,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID 3534c739-dc40-459d-9978-1c7f105addfe -->

**ARMOR**
Suits of armor can be crafted from precious materials or infused with magic to grant them abilities exceeding those of typical armor. Many suits of magic armor are created by etching runes onto them, as described on page 225. The magic armor stat block lists the Price and attributes of the most common armors you can make with fundamental runes. Other special suits of armor might be made of precious materials, and some are specially crafted items all on their own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.076,r=0.517,b=0.237), with ID f37c4ead-3459-499e-92f9-ec3ad7da75b6 -->

## Precious Material Armor
Suits of armor made of precious materials are more expensive and sometimes grant special effects. You can make metal armor out of any precious materials except for duskwood, or you can make wooden armor out of duskwood. Because armor’s Bulk is reduced when the armor is worn, use its carried Bulk when determining its material Price. (Materials are on page 252.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.244,r=0.515,b=0.374), with ID 7d45b0cc-31c6-4c53-806c-caa2088fa064 -->

Elven chain is a chain shirt made of dawnsilver (page 253) that glitters in even the faintest light. Because it’s constructed with small, supple rings, it has no check penalty.

Unlike other chain shirts—even other dawnsilver chain shirts—elven chain doesn’t have the noisy trait.

Summary : This illustration compares four types of fantasy armor, each visually distinct and labeled with its material name.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Four different armors are depicted, each with a unique design and labeled: Adamantine Armor, Cold Iron Armor, Duskwood Armor, and Orichalcum Armor.
  • The armors are arranged in two rows: Adamantine Armor and Cold Iron Armor on the left, Duskwood Armor and Orichalcum Armor on the right.
  • The background is a plain beige color, making the armors stand out.
  • Lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the color palette is dominated by metallic, wood, and gold tones.

Technical Details :

ARMOR ALTERNATIVES
If you don’t want to wear armor, or you’re trained in only unarmored defense, you can wear either explorer’s clothing or bands of force. Explorer’s clothing can be etched with runes just like armor can, so it can provide item bonuses to AC or saves. Bands of force give a +1 item bonus to AC with a Dex modifier cap of +5, and they also grant a bonus to saves. This item can be found on page 286. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.072,r=0.514,b=0.252), with ID a13decb7-f347-46fb-9b4f-fa9d4f212375 -->

Specific Magic Armor  
These suits of armor have abilities far different from what can be gained by etching runes. A specific magic armor lists its fundamental runes, which you can upgrade, add, or transfer as normal.

# SHIELD RUNE
Though shields can’t be etched with weapon or armor runes, they can be improved by a specific type of fundamental rune (page 225) known as a _reinforcing_ rune. _Reinforcing_ runes can be etched only on shields, including specific shields, and every _reinforcing_ rune includes maximum Hardness and Hit Point values. Since the runes work by increasing the structural integrity of a shield by a certain amount, they can’t increase the durability of a shield beyond a listed maximum value. Shields can’t be etched with property runes, only _reinforcing_ runes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.517,b=0.267), with ID 8991337d-be10-40d4-a9da-bcb4df45774b -->

Summary : This image displays four stylized stone carvings, each representing a different rune or symbol, labeled as "Striking," "Quickstrike," "Returning," and "Shock." The carvings are visually distinct and are likely intended to represent different abilities, effects, or concepts.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are four stone-like tablets, each with a unique carved symbol.
  • The background is a plain, light tan color, emphasizing the stones.
  • The stones are arranged horizontally from left to right.
  • Each stone is labeled at the bottom: "STRIKING," "QUICKSTRIKE," "RETURNING," and "SHOCK."
  • Lighting is even, with subtle shadows cast to the right and below each stone.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The carvings are stylized, with each rune featuring a distinct pattern:
    – "STRIKING": A vertical line with symmetrical, angled notches on both sides.
    – "QUICKSTRIKE": Three parallel, upward-slanting lines with arrowheads.
    – "RETURNING": A single, zigzagging line with an arrowhead at the top.
    – "SHOCK": A jagged, branching line resembling a lightning bolt or crack.
  • The labels are in uppercase, sans-serif font, centered below each stone.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The stones are evenly spaced, each occupying a similar amount of visual space.
  • The arrangement is linear, facilitating left-to-right comparison.

Analysis :
  • Each stone represents a distinct concept or ability, visually differentiated by the style of the carved rune.
  • The progression from left to right suggests increasing complexity or different types of effects, with "STRIKING" being the most regular and "SHOCK" the most chaotic.
  • The illustration is likely intended for use in a game, story, or instructional context where each rune has a specific meaning or function. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.060,r=0.877,b=0.352), with ID 69caa928-7541-4153-b7d9-6a73712ea3b9 -->

Activate—Shift Weapon ◆ (manipulate) Effect The weapon takes the shape of another melee weapon that requires the same number of hands to wield.

The weapons a shifting weapon can turn into are based on the base attributes of the weapon, so reference the weapon’s Hands entry in the weapons table to see what it can turn into. For example, a bastard sword requires one hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hands from the two-hand trait. Therefore, a shifting bastard sword could turn into a longsword, but not a greatsword. Activating this rune doesn’t change how many hands you’re currently using to hold the weapon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.542,t=0.755,r=0.905,b=0.879), with ID 21f00299-4ba9-4574-8ca5-6c78b6f67838 -->

Requirements You worship a deity; Effect You supplicate yourself to your deity, and the chaplain’s cudgel becomes a conduit for their power. It transforms into your deity’s favored weapon (as the shifting rune), and etchings of your deity’s religious symbol and other divine depictions spread across the weapon from end to end. This lasts until this activation is used again. While the weapon is attuned to you in this way, you get the following benefits.
• If you have the holy or unholy trait, you can add that trait to Strikes you make with the weapon.
• Whenever you cast a divine spell that takes 2 actions or more to cast, the next Strike you make with this weapon before the end of your next turn gets a status bonus to its damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice. Casting a spell matching the options from your deity’s divine font grants this benefit no matter how many actions you spent casting it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.289,r=0.517,b=0.679), with ID 48646574-f167-4f11-afd3-492d4b75bae7 -->

# ALCHEMY

*Alchemical items are not magical. They instead use the properties of volatile chemicals, exotic minerals, potent plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as alchemical reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set amount of time or until they are countered in some way, typically physically.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.078,r=0.910,b=0.200), with ID dc8da3aa-f0da-4214-afd9-af740507a7c3 -->

Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times they
straddle the line between purely reactive and the
inexplicable. Alchemists can infuse reagents with some
of their own essence, allowing them to efficiently create
short-lived alchemical items at no monetary cost. Even
in these cases, alchemical items don’t radiate magic
auras, instead using the alchemist’s infused essence as
one additional catalyst for the item’s alchemical effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.233,r=0.515,b=0.371), with ID 1a6d6bc5-3864-4f92-b109-85f7ba335f60 -->

Rules for creating alchemical items are found in the Craft activity (*Player Core 236*), and you must have the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to use Crafting to create alchemical items. Critically failing a Crafting check to make alchemical items often causes a dangerous effect, such as an explosion for a bomb or accidental exposure for a poison, in addition to losing some of the materials. Some alchemical items have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these items list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.372,r=0.514,b=0.525), with ID 74ea9e7b-ca2a-4e28-a22b-950520b926b5 -->

All alchemical items have the alchemical trait. Most
also have the consumable trait, which means that the
item is used up once activated. The bomb, elixir, and
poison traits indicate special categories of alchemical
items, each of which is described on the following
pages. Alchemical items without any of these traits are
called alchemical tools and are described further on
page 248. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.525,r=0.514,b=0.649), with ID 26495278-530a-41e7-a0a7-d2a0f90c144d -->

# ALCHEMICAL BOMBS
An alchemical bomb combines volatile components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.658,r=0.513,b=0.739), with ID 6ef21db6-889b-4e50-a5d3-4bc66785ee0f -->

Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you
make a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as
you would for any other weapon. It takes one hand to
draw, prepare, and throw a bomb. The bomb is activated
when thrown as a Strike—you don’t have to activate it
separately. As consumables, bombs can’t have runes
etched onto them, have talismans attached to them, or
benefit from runes granted in other ways (such as from
spells or from items that replicate runes from other
items). Spells and magic items that give you a bonus to
all your attacks (or to all thrown weapons, for example)
can still apply to them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.741,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID fe85e689-4520-4187-b05d-95b971be98c7 -->

Splash Trait  
Most bombs also have the splash trait. When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a critical failure, the bomb misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.231,r=0.905,b=0.417), with ID dac5f0d5-927a-4609-9ffc-599ce539e187 -->

For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target and all creatures within 5 feet take only 1 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.419,r=0.904,b=0.556), with ID 51cc9952-11a3-4807-bd13-c1b743b9fda3 -->

Summary : This image shows two illustrated items labeled "Dread Ampoule" and "Glue Bomb," with a focus on the "Glue Bomb," which appears as a natural, plant-like object.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a round, organic object labeled "GLUE BOMB," resembling a seed pod or fruit with a rough, mottled surface and several protruding stems or roots.
  • The background includes faint outlines of plants or trees, suggesting a natural or forested setting.
  • The color palette is earthy, with greens, browns, and muted tones.
  • The label "DREAD AMPOULE" appears in the upper left, partially visible, with a purple-tinted object above it.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration style is painterly and detailed, with attention to texture and shading.
  • Text labels are in uppercase, sans-serif font.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The "GLUE BOMB" is centrally placed in the foreground, dominating the composition.
  • The "DREAD AMPOULE" label and object are in the upper left, partially cropped and less prominent.
  • The background elements are faded and less detailed, keeping focus on the "GLUE BOMB."

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the "GLUE BOMB" as a distinct, possibly natural or alchemical item, likely for use in a fantasy or game context.
  • The earthy colors and organic form suggest it is derived from nature, possibly a plant-based explosive or trap.
  • The partial inclusion of "DREAD AMPOULE" hints at a series or collection of similar items. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.196,r=0.873,b=0.363), with ID fe3b6a87-453a-4795-a821-43d36a604d32 -->

## Alchemical Poisons
Alchemical poisons are potent toxins distilled or extracted from natural sources and made either stronger or easier to administer. Each poison’s stat block includes the Price and features for a single dose. Poison doses are typically kept in a vial or some other type of safe and secure container. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.076,r=0.516,b=0.173), with ID 6a1b4dc6-9ccd-4501-a379-1d56bb76eee3 -->

Applying alchemical poisons uses Interact actions.
A poison typically requires one hand to pour into food
or scatter in the air. Applying a poison to a weapon or
another item requires two hands, with one hand holding
the weapon or item. The Usage entry for a poison
indicates the number of hands needed for a typical means
of application, but the GM might determine that using
poisons in other ways functions differently. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.173,r=0.515,b=0.295), with ID 9bc732b6-7af7-4cd8-a225-d8ae3723d3cf -->

The full rules for how poisons and other afflictions work are on page 430 of *Player Core*. A creature attempts the listed saving throw as soon as it’s exposed to the poison; on a failed save, the creature advances to Stage 1 of the poison after any listed onset time elapses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.296,r=0.514,b=0.372), with ID 34ea93ee-dad6-4d24-8754-5c40c16ffe34 -->

**Virulent Poisons:** Some poisons have the virulent trait. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.372,r=0.514,b=0.434), with ID ea9bf37b-b706-4a3a-a4ad-b00998abd930 -->

**Method of Exposure**  
Each alchemical poison has one of the following traits, which define how a creature can be exposed to that poison. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.445,r=0.512,b=0.493), with ID 8d52f244-e219-47b0-96e7-c436a46e7b3f -->

Contact: A contact poison is activated by applying it to an item or directly onto a living creature’s skin. The first creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly, the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself. Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.495,r=0.513,b=0.647), with ID 3e558b69-9a76-48f1-b213-63884276c3f3 -->

**Ingested:** An ingested poison is activated by applying
it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature,
or by placing it directly into a living creature’s mouth. A
creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison
when it consumes the poison or the food or drink treated
with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons
typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.649,r=0.513,b=0.755), with ID 8436ec6e-025c-45a1-97be-96c011fe85ec -->

Inhaled: An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a strong wind dissipates the cloud. Every creature entering this cloud is exposed to the poison and must attempt a saving throw against it; a creature aware of the poison before entering the cloud can use a single action to hold its breath and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw for 1 round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.756,r=0.513,b=0.891), with ID d3aa818c-ba18-4a6b-96fb-7ec2d4cccbe6 -->

**Injury:** An injury poison is activated by applying it to  
a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the  
first Strike made using the poisoned item. If that Strike <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.894,r=0.513,b=0.938), with ID eb5d9122-26a9-42e8-88e7-73b8006d29a6 -->

is a success and deals piercing or slashing damage, the
target must attempt a saving throw against the poison.
On a failed Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison
remains on the weapon and you can try again. On a
critical failure, or if the Strike fails to deal slashing or
piercing damage for some other reason, the poison is
spent but the target is unaffected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.188), with ID dc15e3a8-78e7-4b11-a89e-7de75f14fb20 -->

Summary : This illustration shows two fantasy alchemical ingredients, "Brimstone Fumes" and "Giant Scorpion Venom," each represented by a distinct stylized container or vial.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The left object is a metallic, lantern-like vessel emitting thick white smoke, labeled "BRIMSTONE FUMES."
  • The right object is a large, ornate vial shaped like a scorpion's stinger, labeled "GIANT SCORPION VENOM."
  • Both objects are depicted against a plain, light background with their names in bold, uppercase text below each item.
  • The color palette includes metallic browns, silvers, and muted greens for the left vessel, and black, white, and brown for the right vial.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration style is digital, with detailed shading and highlights to suggest three-dimensionality.
  • No additional text, UI elements, or annotations are visible beyond the item names.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two items are positioned side by side, each occupying roughly half of the image width.
  • The smoke from the left vessel drifts rightward, partially overlapping the background space between the two objects.
  • Both items are centered vertically and horizontally within their respective halves.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually contrasts two alchemical substances by their unique containers and associated visual effects (smoke for brimstone fumes, sharp stinger motif for scorpion venom).
  • The design emphasizes the fantastical and potentially dangerous nature of each ingredient through dramatic shapes and effects. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.078,r=0.456,b=0.328), with ID 95bc2fe3-b4c0-4c14-81cf-dd5401ab3d9a -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a large, serpentine, dragon-like creature with purple and blue scales, depicted in a dynamic pose as it is being struck by a spiked weapon, possibly a polearm or spear, from the right side of the image.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a dragon or sea serpent with a long, curved body covered in blue and purple scales and spines.
  • The creature is shown in profile, with its body arched in a dramatic curve.
  • A metallic, spiked weapon is embedded in or striking the creature’s body from the right.

Summary : This image shows a stylized, symmetrical decorative motif with abstract shapes, likely used as an ornamental border or emblem.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a geometric and abstract design featuring a central diamond shape outlined in tan, flanked by two symmetrical, arching forms on either side.
  • The background is dark green on the upper half and dark brown on the lower half, with the motif bridging the two colors.
  • The motif consists of tan lines forming the diamond and arching shapes, with two circular elements (one on each side) suggesting stylized figures or ornamental flourishes.
  • The composition is horizontally symmetrical, with the central diamond as the focal point.

Technical Details :
  • No text, scale bar, or numeric information is present.
  • The design uses a limited color palette: tan for the motif, dark green, and dark brown for the background.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The diamond is centered horizontally and vertically within the motif.
  • The arching shapes and circles are mirrored on the left and right sides, creating balance and symmetry.
  • The motif sits at the boundary between the green and brown background areas.

Analysis :
  • The image is purely decorative, with a strong emphasis on symmetry and geometric abstraction.
  • The motif could serve as a border, divider, or emblem in graphic design, architecture, or print. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.898,t=0.919,r=1.000,b=0.960), with ID 01f0df88-9a5d-40a5-8956-4583f9f6365b -->

# MATERIALS

*Most items are made from readily available materials—usually leather, wood, or steel—but some weapons and armor are made from more exotic materials, giving them unique properties and other advantages. Weapons made from precious materials are better able to harm certain creatures, and armor of these materials provides enhanced protection.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.079,r=0.908,b=0.186), with ID e5415649-c798-4ebd-9b05-9a270541d03e -->

Most materials are metals; they can be used to make
metal weapons and armor. The GM is the final arbiter
of what items can be made using a material. An item
can be made with no more than one precious material,
and only an expert in Crafting can create it. Some rare
and exotic materials require master or even legendary
proficiency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.218,r=0.515,b=0.326), with ID a59fa4ba-5d10-4b3c-8e93-486614e34ef0 -->

A material’s Price depends on how hard it is to work, its scarcity, and its purity; most items made with precious materials use an alloy, blend, or coating rather than using the material in its purest form. The three grades of purity for precious materials are low grade, standard grade, and high grade. Regardless of a precious material’s purity, an item made from it gains the full effects of the precious material, but creating higher-level items and more powerful magic runes with precious material requires greater purity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.327,r=0.514,b=0.479), with ID 6437b6c4-4667-45a1-8c7b-450382ab4ecf -->

Some precious materials are available only at certain grades. For instance, adamantine can’t be low grade, and orichalcum must be high grade. Items made of materials with a lower grade than expected for the item’s level, or of a higher grade than necessary, will mention the precious material’s grade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.480,r=0.514,b=0.573), with ID 8ea444e1-903b-4573-937a-fcec4aa68afc -->

## Material Statistics
The table below provides the Hardness, Hit Points, Broken Threshold, and example items for some types of common materials. The table has separate entries for thin items (like shields), ordinary items (like armor), and reinforced or durable structures (such as walls). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.582,r=0.514,b=0.678), with ID 25fbb17e-b5a1-44fb-add3-b93309809430 -->

Stone is a catchall for any hard stone, such as granite
and marble. Likewise, wood covers ordinary woods, such
as oak and pine. Metal weapons and armor are assumed
to be made of iron or steel unless noted otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.679,r=0.513,b=0.739), with ID 2820f83d-7ab2-4895-bf18-4de5f32190d2 -->

If an object consists of more than one material, the
GM typically uses the statistics for the strongest material
involved. For instance, breaking a wall made of paper
panels over a woven wooden framework would require
damaging thin wood, not paper. However, the GM
might choose the weaker material based on the item’s
function. For instance, breaking the wooden handle of
a hammer rather than its iron head would still render
the item unusable. Sometimes an item is even less sturdy
than the Hardness and Hit Points provided for a thin
object; for instance, a twig doesn’t take 9 damage to
break, even though it’s made of thin wood. Similarly,
a particularly sturdy item or structure might have even <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.741,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 33d0e99b-83a7-4308-8556-59b3bb39080a -->

higher Hardness and Hit Points. Certain structures,
particularly thick walls, are so reinforced that you have
to break them down over time with tools. (Page 93 has
more information on walls.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.219,r=0.904,b=0.280), with ID 793eec0d-2f81-448b-b7d6-458adcc5bee0 -->
