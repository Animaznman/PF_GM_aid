This rule's purpose is to make the game run smoothly, with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It's not intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!\n\nHow you implement collaboration in a game depends on what your players are interested in. In some groups, players enjoy adding details to the world and to the nonplayer characters. In others, players want to feel like the world is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to make are those made by their own characters. Both are fun and acceptable ways to play.",

The image is used as cover art for the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" book.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject is a large, dark-sailed ship struggling against massive, curling ocean waves.\n  • The ship is tilted at a steep angle, with crew members visible on deck bracing themselves or holding onto rigging.\n  • The background features a turbulent, stormy sky with a prominent lightning bolt illuminating the left side.\n  • The color palette is dominated by dark blues, greens, and purples, emphasizing the stormy, perilous atmosphere.\n  • The upper left corner includes a stylized dragon illustration and the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" title.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.\n  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible rain streaks, foaming water, and intricate ship rigging.\n  • No on-image UI elements or additional text beyond the book title.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The ship occupies the lower right and central portion of the image, with the bow facing leftward into the waves.\n  • The largest wave is cresting on the right, threatening to engulf the ship.\n  • Lightning and the brightest part of the sky are on the left, providing dramatic backlighting.\n  • The dragon illustration and title are in the upper left, separated from the main scene by a border.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration conveys a sense of danger, chaos, and high adventure, fitting for a fantasy roleplaying game.\n  • The composition draws the viewer's eye from the lightning on the left, across the stormy sea, to the imperiled ship and its crew.\n  • The use of dark colors and dynamic lines (rain, waves, rigging) enhances the feeling of movement and urgency.",

You and the players can work out what their characters do during solid stretches of downtime via e-mail or chat messages. You can also give players opportunities to collaborate on details of the story, like having a player design a heraldic symbol for the adventuring group or map out their home base. You might even decide to award a Hero Point at the next session to a player for events that happened outside a session.\n\nSome events aren't suitable for handling outside of sessions. Any event that strongly affects a character whose player isn't present should be handled at the table when everyone can attend. It's also helpful to recap events that took place outside of the session for all characters so no one feels excluded or lost.",

For example, an NPC with a background of abuse, a former or current slave, or a character with disabilities requires respectful handling. This is particularly true if you, as the GM, do not have the same life experience as the NPC in question. If you want to include these themes for an NPC, you should probably bring it up with your players beforehand and set expectations. You don't need to spoil the character, but sitting down and checking in with your players can help prevent unpleasant surprises and is better than assuming. To keep the representation respectful, avoid cliches and don't use the hook as a joke. Your group's guidelines for objectionable content can also help you portray NPCs respectfully.",

Don't have both sides roll (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).\n- • If an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty.\n- • If you're not sure how difficult a significant challenge should be, use the DC for the party's level.\n- • If you're making up an effect, creatures should be incapacitated or killed on only a critical success (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).\n- • If you don't know what check to use, pick the most appropriate skill. If no other skill applies to a check to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate Lore skill (usually at an untrained proficiency rank).\n- • Use the characters' daily preparations as the time to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.\n- • When a character accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn't have rules for XP, award them XP for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP, as described on page 56).\n- • When the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they might fail forward, meaning the story moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely.",

A gentle reminder of how the rule, spell, or ability in question functions is usually enough to move past the situation. Every once in a great while, you'll encounter a player who is deliberately cheating. The spirit of roleplaying is one of cooperative storytelling and overcoming challenges together, so one player cheating steals fun from every other player at the table. It's natural to feel some anger in this situation, so make sure you let some time pass between when you discover that a player is cheating and when you address it with them.",

However, they can also run into trouble when the PCs have gaps in their abilities. In many cases, the easiest way to adjust for a small group is to add additional characters. This could come in the form of allowing each player to play two characters or adding hirelings and support NPCs to the party to shore up roles that the PCs don't fill. When adding GM-controlled NPCs to the party, it's important to be sure that the PCs remain the stars of the show. In general, GM-controlled characters shouldn't make major decisions, and they shouldn't outshine PCs at their primary skills or roles. You can also use variant rules like free archetypes (page 84), extra treasure, or even just a few bonus trained skills to help improve the PCs' overall flexibility.",

However, they also divide the GM's attention. Large groups also need to set ground rules for how many players need to be present for the game to run when some players are missing. Recaps at the beginning of each session are crucial to keep everyone on the same page. Delegation is one of your most powerful tools to keep the session running smoothly. For example, you can put the players in charge of recapping the events from the previous session, handling initiative, managing the party's treasury, looking up rules, or helping with accessories like props and music. Also consider which tasks really need to be taken care of while everyone is there. For example, you could ask your players to handle selling items, deciding which common items they want to buy, and leveling up between sessions instead of at the table.",

You have full control over whether PCs can access them. Named NPCs are unique creatures, though that doesn't mean their base creature type is unique. For instance, an orc named Graytusk is unique, but that doesn't mean it would be any harder for a PC encountering her to tell she's an orc—just to discern specific information about her.",

It's okay to look up something that's both significant and heavily rules-dependent, such as a spell description or the death and dying rules. Even then, reciting a full chunk of rules text can pull players out of the flow of play, so feel free to summarize. It also helps to train your players to look things up in advance if they think they'll need them, so they're ready to go when their turns come around. This can be tough as a GM since it's essentially always your turn.

Helping someone hold a lockpick steady might be enough preparation to Aid an attempt to Pick a Lock, but just saying you're going to \"encourage\" them likely wouldn't. Second, the character who's attempting to Aid needs to be in a proper position to help and able to convey any necessary information. Helping a character Climb a wall is pretty tough if the character a PC wishes to Aid is nowhere near them. Similarly, a character usually needs to be next to their ally or a foe to Aid the ally in attacking the foe. You'll also need to determine how long the preparation takes. Typically, a single action is sufficient to help with a task that's completed in a single round, but to help someone perform a long-term task, like research, the character has to help until the task is finished.",

You also might need to determine when the situation changes enough for someone to try to Sense Motive again. Usually, this means either the behavior of the subject needs to change or the person attempting the check needs to receive new evidence that something is out of the ordinary. If another PC tries to Sense Motive, gets different information about the target, and shares it, that doesn't really count as new information for a PC who tried previously.

However, you can end up in odd situations, such as when a creature wants to jump vertically to get something and needs to move just a bit to get in range, then Leap, then continue moving. This can end up feeling like they're losing a lot of their movement to make this happen. At your discretion, you can allow the PCs to essentially combine these into one fluid movement as a 2-action activity: moving into range for a Leap, then Leaping, then using the rest of their Speed.",

This will fit better thematically and prevent the enemy from being dismounted too easily. If a mount is knocked out, the rider might be able to dismount without trouble if the mount was stationary, but if they were in motion, you should probably have the rider attempt a Reflex save. If they fail, the rider is thrown a short distance and falls prone. Setting a simple expert DC of 20 often works well for such checks.",

The 3-action structure is your best friend. You might find yourself answering a lot of questions about actions and space, like \"Can I get there this turn?\" or \"How many of the oozes can I catch in a fireball?\" If you find yourself needing to repeatedly remind players of the physical features of the environment or enemy positioning, that might mean you're making your encounters too tactical for what a gridless game supports.

Two significant challenges for non-aquatic creatures are breathing underwater (or holding their breath) and lacking a swim Speed. It's often best to save aquatic adventure until higher levels when PCs can get magical solutions for these problems, but you can instead give out such magic early since it isn't easy to exploit in land-based adventures the way flight magic can be. As with flight, dispelling can be deadly if someone relies on magic to breathe underwater. It's generally best to avoid having enemies who can breathe underwater dispelling the water-breathing magic aiding PCs. Though PCs might be able to use air bubble and quickly cast water breathing again, having this happen repeatedly can",

Let the player roleplay what their character says and does, then determine what they'll roll. Allow them to use any abilities or spells that might help them make their case, though keep in mind that when most people see the visual signs of a spell being cast, they think someone is using magic to try to influence or harm them, and they have a negative reaction.

Here, you might use the story you have\nin place; for example, a player's new character might\nbe the sibling of their previous, slain character, thus\ncreating some continuity between the two characters\nand ensuring that the new character still has a stake in\ndefeating the villain.",

You could have a pit trap in the middle of a large room, but a surprise that's entirely unexpected can be pretty unsatisfying. The same pit trap appearing in the middle of a 10-foot-wide, suspiciously featureless hallway can make the players say, \"Okay, we should have seen that coming,\" with even that minimal amount of foreshadowing.",

The scene is viewed from within a large cavern or opening, looking outward and upward toward the city structures.\n\nphoto:  \nScene Overview :  \n  • The main subject is a vast, multi-tiered architectural complex built into a rocky cliff, featuring numerous arches, columns, and terraces.  \n  • The setting is arid and mountainous, with warm, golden sunlight filtering through the opening at the top, casting dramatic shadows and highlights.  \n  • The composition is dynamic, with the viewer's perspective from inside a cave or shaded area, looking out toward the sunlit city.  \n  • The color palette consists of warm earth tones—yellows, oranges, and browns—contrasted by the dark shadows of the cave interior.\n\nTechnical Details :  \n  • No scale bar or explicit measurement references are present.  \n  • The illustration style is detailed and semi-realistic, with careful attention to architectural and environmental features.  \n  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :  \n  • Foreground: Two figures stand at the cave's edge—one on the left in armor holding a spear, and one on the right in draped robes.  \n  • Midground: Suspended wooden platforms or lifts hang from ropes, suggesting vertical movement between levels.  \n  • Background: The city extends upward, with multiple levels of arches and structures carved into the rock, culminating in a sunlit opening at the top.  \n  • The scene uses strong perspective lines, drawing the eye from the dark foreground to the illuminated city and sky above.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The illustration conveys a sense of mystery and grandeur, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the ancient city.  \n  • The interplay of light and shadow highlights the architectural details and the verticality of the space.  \n  • The presence of figures and suspended platforms suggests human activity and the use of mechanical means to traverse the city's heights.  \n  • The overall mood is one of awe and discovery, as if the viewer is encountering a lost or hidden civilization.",

For instance, they might be ambushed by bandits if they were flaunting their wealth or showing off expensive items earlier in the session, or they might be counterattacked by enemies if they attack the enemies first, only to retreat to rest. If the PCs set up camp hastily and decide not to set a watch, they might be in trouble if they're attacked. This should happen only in cases of extreme sloppiness, since if you take advantage of minor lapses, you might end up with a group that repeatedly spends an inordinate amount of time describing all their camping preparation to keep it from happening again.

When\nthe PCs enter a dungeon or a new area, describe how it\nfeels, slowing down to give the players a sense of what's\nahead. When a PC stops to do something important or\nmakes a key decision, slowing down gives that moment\nits desired weight. You can also adjust the flow of time\nto reflect PCs' mental states. As a PC returns home\nafter decades away, you might pause to ask the player\nwhat their PC is feeling, matching time to the rush of\nmemories and emotions filling that PC's thoughts.",

The most common activities are Avoid Notice, Detect Magic, Hustle, and Search, though there are many other options available (detailed on page 438 of _Player Core_). The purpose of these activities within the game is to clarify what a PC focuses on as they explore rather than unrealistically allowing them do all things simultaneously. This adds variety within the group's behavior and can show you where players want the story to go. For example, a player whose PC is Investigating carvings on the walls shows you that the player wants those to be informative.",

For instance, if the rogue's contact at the thieves' guild wants a special magical cloak, a different PC might Craft that cloak. This lets those PCs help each other more directly.

As\nnoted in Identify Magic, other magic-related skills can\ntypically be used at a higher DC, so you might decide\nthe check is very hard for a character using Occultism\ninstead and set the DC at 24 for characters using that\nskill. If a character in your group had Dragon Lore, you\nmight determine that it would be easy or very easy for\nthem to use that skill and adjust the DC to 17 or 14.\nThese adjustments aren't taking the place of characters'\nbonuses, modifiers, and penalties—they are due to the\napplicability of the skills being used.",

A Lore subcategory represents a narrow focus, and thus it shouldn't replace all or even most of an entire skill, nor should it convey vast swaths of information. For example, a single Lore subcategory doesn't cover all religions—that's covered by the Religion skill—but a character could have a Lore subcategory that covers a single deity. One Lore subcategory won't cover an entire country or all of history, but it could cover a city, an ancient civilization, or one aspect of a modern country, like Taldan History Lore. A single Lore subcategory couldn't cover the entire multiverse, but it could cover a whole plane (other than the Universe).",

You can put self-contained dungeons or other locations within the sandbox, but it's up to the players when and how to visit them or deal with them.\n\nTo make a sandbox, create about triple the number of encounters and spread them out among multiple locations or factions. You can expect the PCs won't deal with all of them. In most cases, you'll want to determine where the PCs are headed next before the end of a session so you can prepare for the next session. Depending on the size and complexity of the location, the number of encounters might be much higher.

Including NPCs who aren't adversaries makes the world feel more real. It also increases the stakes, as PCs have people to care about, protect, and socialize with. You'll often find that NPCs you create will become more or less important than you expected.

Higher-level single enemies, squads of enemies, and large numbers of lackeys all feel different.\n- • Setup: Not all encounters should start and end the same way. PCs might sneak up on unprepared enemies, get ambushed by foes hunting them, enter into a formal duel, or find a diplomatic overture fails and turns into a fight. On the other side, enemies might all be taken out, retreat, beg for mercy, or even shift the encounter to a chase or other phase.\n- • Information: Uncertainty can increase the tension and sense of danger the players feel.

    "text": "Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting an intense battle scene between two armored humanoid characters and a large, blue-skinned, muscular creature wielding curved swords, set in an ornate, high-ceilinged hall with dramatic lighting.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subjects are two armored humanoid figures (one casting a spell, the other wielding a rapier) confronting a towering, blue-skinned, muscular creature with gold and green arm bracers and a skirt-like garment.\n  • The spellcaster, positioned on the left, is channeling a stream of fiery energy directly into the creature's chest, causing a burst of flames and visible impact.\n  • The second humanoid, in the foreground, is lunging forward with a rapier, aiming at the creature's lower torso.\n  • The setting is an opulent hall with tall windows, ornate columns, and warm, golden lighting that highlights the action.\n  • The color palette is dominated by golds, reds, blues, and oranges, with dynamic lighting effects emphasizing the magical attack.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.\n  • The illustration is highly detailed, with intricate armor designs, magical effects, and environmental textures.\n  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The spellcaster is on the left, standing with an outstretched arm, while the rapier-wielding character is in the lower center, closer to the viewer.\n  • The blue-skinned creature occupies the right and central background, towering over the other figures.\n  • The action is centered, with the magical attack forming a diagonal line from left to right, drawing the viewer's eye across the composition.\n  • The background features architectural elements (windows, columns) that frame the combatants and add depth.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration conveys a dramatic, high-stakes confrontation, with the focus on teamwork and the use of both magic and melee combat against a formidable foe.\n  • The dynamic poses, fiery magical effects, and expressive lighting create a sense of movement and urgency.\n  • The composition uses diagonal lines and contrasting colors to emphasize the impact of the spell and the threat posed by the large creature.",

This normally means foes fleeing at a certain point, potentially ending the encounter, but if the PCs need to capture those opponents, it could add a secondary objective and split their focus. Look at how differences in morale between participants impact the fight. For instance, after the necromancer's living allies surrender to the PCs, she might activate a latent magic she implanted within them, killing them and merging their bodies into an enormous undead abomination. An enemy's morale could even change the encounter from combat to social, as the PCs enter negotiations over a surrender or try to convince foes of the errors of their ways.",

    "text": "## Combining and Separating Encounters\nPicture this: the PCs storm a castle. They choose to eschew stealth in favor of a direct approach. On the ramparts, a guard spots them and raises an alarm. The sound of horns and whistles blares throughout the keep as each defender ensures that everyone is ready for a fight. And then, they politely wait in whatever room they were already standing in for the PCs to come and attack them. It sounds pretty unrealistic, and it feels unrealistic at the table. Many players find it far more satisfying when their foes take reasonable actions and countermeasures against them, such as moving to defensible positions or banding together with allies. Taken to an extreme, combining encounters can quickly lead to fights that are unwinnable, so be careful. In the castle example, some guards may come out to attack the PCs, while others cluster around the central keep. Perhaps each individual patrol of guards around the castle is a trivial-threat encounter, but as they gather together, they form groups of gradually escalating threat. Such groups give the PCs a sense of how challenging their opposition is, so that if a fight against six guards is a challenge, they won't try to pick a fight with 30. When the PCs' foes amass into an overwhelming force, give the PCs fair warning and a chance to retreat and try again another day. Of course, if the PCs come back after the alarm has been raised, the guards are likely to change their rotations to better secure the keep.",

    "text": "## PITFALLS\n\nThis section arms you with a wide variety of useful tricks to add interest to your encounters, but you should keep an eye out for some common pitfalls of encounter building.  \n• **Don't Make Every Encounter Complex:** There are many ways to make complex and dynamic encounters, but making every single encounter complex will become exhausting for you and your players. Some encounters should be simple, both because it will make the world feel more real and because it's a good way for the group to relax without as much to keep track of.  \n• **Avoid Flat Difficulty:** Ensure that not too many of your encounters fall at the same threat level. Having some low- and even trivial-threat battles adds variety, and it's great to throw in a few severe encounters beyond just bosses.  \n• **Beware of Unexpected Difficulty:** You might end up with creatures that have abilities that fit well together, making them extremely powerful as a combo, or that are particularly well-suited against your PCs. Compare the creatures and what you know about your PCs in advance, especially if the encounter is already a severe threat by the numbers. Page 26 has suggestions for what to do if you find a spike in difficulty during an encounter rather than in advance.  \n• **Watch for Overpowered Terrain:** As noted under Budgeting for Terrain, some features of the environment can increase the danger drastically. Consider your creature and the environment, and see whether the creature has a massive advantage compared to PCs in that terrain, such as a monster with powerful, long-range attacks when PCs are stuck at a distance. If so, you might want to adjust.",

After all, while low- and trivial-threat encounters have an incredibly low chance of defeating the PCs, the opposition can usually hold on long enough to make the PCs spend a few rounds to defeat them unless the PCs expend more resources than they normally would on such foes. Time pressure is often related to a secondary objective in the encounter, though it could be a countdown directly related to the encounter itself. For instance, if the ritual will grant a lich its apotheosis in 4 rounds, the heroes need to defeat the lich before then!",

Illusion spells can allow a foe to attack from a safer position, and possession grants the foe a disposable body unless the PCs brought along spirit blast or similar magic.

In their next encounter with the PCs, give them additional minions, spells, or other defenses designed to counteract the strategies the PCs used against them previously. Even if the villain doesn't escape, they might have other tricks up their sleeves, such as rising again to oppose the PCs. They could well return later in the adventure—or they might come back immediately for a second battle, so long as there is a proper justification for doing so.

The image is cropped with a decorative gold border at the bottom right.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject is a section of a large, dragon-like creature's tail or body, covered in dark purple and green scales with prominent spikes.\n  • A metallic polearm weapon with a spiked head is shown impacting or lodged in the creature.\n  • The background is light, with swirling mist or clouds, suggesting an outdoor or aerial setting.\n  • The image is vertically oriented and partially framed by a gold ornamental border at the lower right.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.\n  • The illustration uses a muted, cool color palette with purples, greens, and silvery grays.\n  • Lighting is diffuse, with no strong shadows, emphasizing the texture of the scales and weapon.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The creature's body curves from the upper left to the lower right, occupying most of the frame.\n  • The polearm enters from the right, intersecting the creature's body at a perpendicular angle.\n  • The gold border frames the lower right corner, suggesting this is part of a larger, ornate illustration or page.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys a dynamic moment of conflict or attack, focusing on the impact between weapon and creature.\n  • The detailed rendering of scales and weapon suggests a fantasy or mythological context, likely from a game or illustrated book.\n  • The composition draws attention to the violence of the encounter and the formidable nature of the creature.",

The skills and options used to disable haunts vary, though using Religion for an exorcism is common. However, even with a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine what it would take to lay it to rest permanently.",

For example, in Monster Core, demons are creatures of sin and are designed to have weaknesses against specific virtues that oppose them. Satyrs enchant creatures by playing their pipes, represented by their centerpiece ability, Play the Pipes.

In that case, it can be more efficient to simply \"reskin\" the old creature rather than design a new one—that is, to change the description but keep the abilities mostly the same. Occasionally, reskinning requires small mechanical adjustments. For instance, a fire cat that has immunity to fire, an aura that deals fire damage, and the ability to light people on fire with its jaws to deal persistent fire damage could be reskinned as a caustic animate tree that has immunity to acid, an aura that deals acid damage, and branch attacks that smear acidic sap on a creature's body when they hit, dealing persistent acid damage.",

For instance, let's say you're improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it's time for initiative, you decide it has moderate Perception and jot down \"Per +8.\" Your group's fighter beats it at initiative and attacks. You decide the soldier has high AC—looking at the Armor Class table, you see that's 18—and add this information to your note. The fighter's Strike hits, and you select the low end of high HP: 36. Well, now it's 25. Your note says \"Per +8, AC 18, HP 25.\" If it gets to take a turn, you can give it a Strike then.",

These healing abilities can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast healing heals a number of hits each round—usually one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on the Strike Damage table (page 120) and multiply that value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy to overcome—and remember that most regeneration gets easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to decrease the creature's total HP by double its regeneration value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it can't prevent a creature's death and there isn't always a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.",

Usually, a damage expression works best when roughly half the damage is from dice and half is from the flat modifier. If your creature deals special damage, like 1d6 fire from _flaming_ attacks, that counts toward its total damage per Strike. Keep in mind that a creature using a weapon should have a damage value that feels right for that weapon. Extreme damage works well for two-handed weapons that use d10s or d12s for damage. On the other hand, a dagger uses only d4s, so a dagger wielder would need something like sneak attack to deal extreme damage, or you might compensate for the dagger's lower damage per Strike by giving the creature the ability to attack more efficiently or use other tricks.",

Spiritual ponderings like these are central to belief systems across the globe.

The scene is rendered in a fantasy art style, likely representing a deity or important figure in a mythological or game context.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Central subject is a stone statue of a woman in a long robe, holding a trident in her left hand and a tall staff in her right.\n  • The statue stands on a pedestal, with two stone plinths on either side, each supporting a bronze bowl with flames rising from them.\n  • At the base of the statue are various offerings, including a basket of green apples, a loaf of bread, a purple vegetable (possibly an eggplant), a scroll, and a curved horn.\n  • The background is white, with some text partially visible along the left edge, suggesting the image is embedded in a book or document.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.\n  • Lighting is even, with shadows suggesting a light source from above and slightly to the left.\n  • The color palette includes grays for the statue, orange and yellow for the flames, and natural colors for the offerings.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The statue is centrally placed and dominates the composition.\n  • The burning braziers are symmetrically positioned to the left and right of the statue.\n  • Offerings are arranged in the foreground, at the base of the statue, creating a sense of ritual or veneration.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys a sense of reverence and ritual, with the statue as the focal point and the offerings and flames enhancing the ceremonial atmosphere.\n  • The symmetrical arrangement and the presence of offerings suggest the statue represents a figure of worship or importance, possibly a goddess or priestess in a fantasy or mythological setting.",

As one travels east from the Inner Sea, the vast expanse of the continent of Casmaron stretches beyond the horizon.

The Padishah Empire of Kelesh dominates much of western Casmaron, with its satrapy of Qadira reaching into the Inner Sea. To the south of Kelesh lies the peninsula of Vudra, a massive and ancient civilization consisting of over one hundred semi-independent kingdoms.

The scene is dark, eerie, and action-filled, evoking horror and supernatural themes.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject: Several undead creatures, with the most prominent being a decayed, bloodied zombie clawing its way out of the ground in the foreground.\n  • Setting: A graveyard at night, under a full moon, with leafless trees and a large, gothic-style church in the background.\n  • Perspective: Low-angle, close-up on the central zombie, with others rising from graves in the midground and background.\n  • Composition: The central zombie dominates the right foreground, reaching toward the viewer; other zombies are distributed across the scene, creating depth and a sense of encroaching threat.\n  • Lighting: Moonlight casts a cold, blue glow over the scene, with strong highlights and deep shadows; the zombies' eyes and wounds are accentuated with red, contrasting with the blue tones.\n  • Colour palette: Predominantly cool blues and greys, with vivid red for blood and glowing eyes.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or measurement references.\n  • No on-image text except for the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" branding at the top.\n  • Artist signature \"FELIZ\" in the lower left corner.\n  • Stylised, painterly digital art style.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • Foreground: Central zombie emerging from a grave, reaching out with a bloodied hand.\n  • Midground: Several other zombies in various stages of emerging from graves, some partially obscured by tombstones and grass.\n  • Background: Gothic church, bare trees, and a large full moon, establishing the setting and mood.\n  • Rule-of-thirds: The main zombie's face and hand are positioned near the intersection points, drawing the viewer's focus.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration conveys a sense of horror and imminent danger, with the undead appearing to rise en masse.\n  • The use of lighting and colour heightens the supernatural and menacing atmosphere.\n  • The composition leads the viewer's eye from the central figure outward, emphasising the scale of the undead threat and the isolation of the graveyard setting.\n  • The church in the background adds a gothic, possibly religious undertone, contrasting the sanctity of the place with the profane act of the dead rising.",

The use of color and line creates a sense of elegance and formality, suggesting it may be part of a border or header in a larger design.",

For example, the elven nation of Kyonin has the elf trait, indicating that it was created by and remains almost exclusively populated by elves. Similarly, a nation with an extremely particular focus might have a trait to represent that, such as Galt, which has the revolutionary trait.",

The scene is magical and vibrant, with swirling blue energy effects emanating from the flute.\n\nillustration:  \n\nScene Overview :  \n  • The main subject is a short, humanoid character (possibly a halfling or gnome) standing in the center, playing a silver flute.  \n  • The character is dressed in colorful, medieval-style clothing with a red jacket, green kilt, and boots.  \n  • Surrounding the central figure are multiple small, humanoid fairies with butterfly-like wings, glowing in yellow and purple hues.  \n  • The background features a lush, green forest with a large waterfall cascading down rocks, and a pool of water at the base.  \n  • On the left, a satyr-like creature sits on a bench, observing the scene.  \n  • The lighting is ethereal, with magical blue swirls and sparkles radiating from the flute, illuminating the fairies and the central figure.  \n  • The color palette is dominated by greens, blues, and yellows, creating a mystical atmosphere.\n\nTechnical Details :  \n  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.  \n  • The illustration is highly detailed, with careful attention to the magical effects and the fairies' wings.  \n  • No on-image text or UI elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :  \n  • The central figure is in the foreground, occupying the middle of the composition.  \n  • Fairies are distributed in a circular pattern around the flute player, some flying and some standing on the ground or rocks.  \n  • The satyr-like observer is positioned to the left, partially in shadow, while the waterfall and forest form the background.  \n  • The magical energy swirls create a sense of motion and focus attention on the flute and the fairies.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The illustration conveys a sense of enchantment and harmony between the central figure and the magical creatures.  \n  • The swirling blue energy visually links the music to the fairies, suggesting the flute playing is summoning or enchanting them.  \n  • The composition uses light and color to draw the viewer's eye to the interaction between the musician and the fairies, emphasizing the magical theme.",

A mix of rewards is best! Backstory can be interesting, but isn't much of a reward on its own. Research that uncovers only backstory should appear only at the lowest thresholds.",

Chases often end when the pursuer reaches the same obstacle as the pursued, leading to a combat encounter or other scene. However, it's less clear when to end a chase otherwise. It's typically best to have an obstacle that ends the chase with the pursued character getting away, as long as they overcome the obstacle before being captured. This is usually better than ending the chase after a certain number of rounds, because reaching a hideaway makes more narrative sense and because you might not be able to predict how far the pursued characters move in those rounds, making you run out of obstacles. You can also end the chase in favor of the pursued characters if they ever get a certain number of obstacles ahead of the pursuers (typically three), as the pursuers simply lose the trail.

Set the DCs based on the standard DC of the party level using the table on page 53, and adjust them using the DC Adjustments on page 53. When given a range of skills for an activity or event, you should vary the difficulty based on the needs of the story. For instance, if a PC is Scouting a Location, you might want to use a low DC for Stealth (because it's easier to scout when unnoticed), a hard one for Perception (because while the PC might see the enemy, the enemy might also see them), and a very hard DC for Society (because walking in like you belong is difficult if you don't have an invitation or the right uniform).

This is especially useful for a sandbox campaign or other structure with numerous possibilities, helping you build a reactive structure and track how PCs are doing with groups they interact with only occasionally. When the point totals don't fit the story, use common sense. For instance, if the PCs are hunted by the town guard due to a corrupt mayor, but then perform a major quest revealing the mayor's wrongdoing and saving the town, that might jump them from the worst negative reputation to a much more positive reputation. Similarly, the PCs' foes could frame them, harming the PCs' reputation even though they've done no disservice.",

Almost all alchemical items are consumable items that are used up when you activate them. This category includes bombs (page 244), elixirs (page 246), poisons (page 248), and alchemical tools (page 251).\n- • Materials includes the statistics for standard items and structures along with rules for precious materials that can be used to make items with unique properties and other advantages (page 252).\n- • Momentary Magic has a plethora of magical consumables, including ammunition (page 255), oils applied to the surface of objects and people (page 257), potions to drink (page 259), scrolls used to cast more spells (page 262), talismans affixed to items (page 263), and wondrous consumables of all sorts (page 268).\n- • Trappings of Power are permanent and powerful. They include apex items that can increase an attribute modifier (page 270), companion items for pets (page 272), held items (page 273), magical staves for spellcasters (page 278), wands that can repeatedly cast more spells (page 282), and a vast collection of worn items (page 284).\n- • Gems & Art Objects (page 298) make for an interesting variety of treasures.\n- • Artifacts (page 300) are extraordinarily powerful magic items ideal to build adventures and plots around.\n- • Intelligent Items (page 304) provides options for conscious items.\n- • Cursed Items (page 306), used sparingly, can add danger and fun to items.\n- • Relics (page 308) let you build a special item that unlocks new powers over time through the story of a campaign.",

Learn more about staves on page 278. Scrolls and wands (pages 262 and 282) provide extra spells in a more limited capacity.\n- • **Weapon alternatives.** Characters using unarmed attacks need *handwraps of mighty blows* (page 290) or similar items instead of weapon runes.\n- • **Healing potions.** Keep them alive on page 259!",

Since the runes work by increasing the structural integrity of a shield by a certain amount, they can't increase the durability of a shield beyond a listed maximum value. Shields can't be etched with property runes, only _reinforcing_ runes.",

When a spontaneous spellcaster Activates a staff, they can expend 1 charge from the staff and one of their spell slots to cast a spell from the staff of the same rank (or lower) as the expended spell slot. This doesn't change the number of actions it takes to cast the spell. For example, if a sorcerer can cast 3rd-rank spells and prepared a staff, the staff would gain 3 charges. They could expend 1 charge and one of their 3rd-rank spell slots to cast a 3rd-rank spell from the staff, or 1 charge and one of their 2nd-rank spell slots to cast a 2nd-rank spell from the staff. They could still expend 3 charges from the staff to cast a 3rd-rank spell from it without using any of their own slots, just like any other spellcaster.",

Intelligent items can't be crafted by normal means—typically an accident, a divine act, or a major sacrifice on the part of the creator is required to grant the item the mental essence it needs for sentience, and in some rare cases the spiritual essence it needs to have a soul of its own. Because of this, intelligent items are always rare or unique. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or using an item of its type still apply to an intelligent item. In addition, intelligent items have a few statistics other items lack.",
