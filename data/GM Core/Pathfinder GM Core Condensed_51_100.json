For example, a single Lore subcategory doesn\u2019t cover all religions\u2014that\u2019s covered by the Religion skill\u2014but a character could have a Lore subcategory that covers a single deity. One Lore subcategory won\u2019t cover an entire country or all of history, but it could cover a city, an ancient civilization, or one aspect of a modern country, like Taldan History Lore. A single Lore subcategory couldn\u2019t cover the entire multiverse, but it could cover a whole plane (other than the Universe).",

In most cases, you\u2019ll want to determine where the PCs are headed next before the end of a session so you can prepare for the next session.

You\u2019ll want most to follow the theme directly, like the examples in Threats on page 71. However, you can add a few counterpoints to the theme. For example, a horror game might include one or two NPCs who are more hopeful, either to grant respite from the dread or to kill off to show just how bad things are. Including NPCs who aren\u2019t adversaries makes the world feel more real. It also increases the stakes, as PCs have people to care about, protect, and socialize with. You\u2019ll often find that NPCs you create will become more or less important than you expected.

Use low- and even trivial-threat encounters to give PCs chances to really shine, and severe-threat encounters for especially powerful enemies. Extreme-threat encounters should be used sparingly, for enemies who match the threat posed by the PCs and have a solid chance of beating them! The adventure recipes on page 68 include a mix of combat difficulties that can be useful to look at.\n- \u2022 Complexity: Use high complexity judiciously, saving it for important or memorable fights.\n- \u2022 Encounter Composition: The number of creatures per encounter and their levels should vary. Higher-level single enemies, squads of enemies, and large numbers of lackeys all feel different.\n- \u2022 Setup: Not all encounters should start and end the same way. PCs might sneak up on unprepared enemies, get ambushed by foes hunting them, enter into a formal duel, or find a diplomatic overture fails and turns into a fight. On the other side, enemies might all be taken out, retreat, beg for mercy, or even shift the encounter to a chase or other phase.\n- \u2022 Information: Uncertainty can increase the tension and sense of danger the players feel.

On the ramparts, a guard spots them and raises an alarm. The sound of horns and whistles blares throughout the keep as each defender ensures that everyone is ready for a fight. And then, they politely wait in whatever room they were already standing in for the PCs to come and attack them. It sounds pretty unrealistic, and it feels unrealistic at the table. Many players find it far more satisfying when their foes take reasonable actions and countermeasures against them, such as moving to defensible positions or banding together with allies. Taken to an extreme, combining encounters can quickly lead to fights that are unwinnable, so be careful. In the castle example, some guards may come out to attack the PCs, while others cluster around the central keep. Perhaps each individual patrol of guards around the castle is a trivial-threat encounter, but as they gather together, they form groups of gradually escalating threat. Such groups give the PCs a sense of how challenging their opposition is, so that if a fight against six guards is a challenge, they won\u2019t try to pick a fight with 30. When the PCs\u2019 foes amass into an overwhelming force, give the PCs fair warning and a chance to retreat and try again another day. Of course, if the PCs come back after the alarm has been raised, the guards are likely to change their rotations to better secure the keep.",

Some encounters should be simple, both because it will make the world feel more real and because it\u2019s a good way for the group to relax without as much to keep track of.  \n\u2022 **Avoid Flat Difficulty:** Ensure that not too many of your encounters fall at the same threat level. Having some low- and even trivial-threat battles adds variety, and it\u2019s great to throw in a few severe encounters beyond just bosses.  \n\u2022 **Beware of Unexpected Difficulty:** You might end up with creatures that have abilities that fit well together, making them extremely powerful as a combo, or that are particularly well-suited against your PCs. Compare the creatures and what you know about your PCs in advance, especially if the encounter is already a severe threat by the numbers. Page 26 has suggestions for what to do if you find a spike in difficulty during an encounter rather than in advance.  \n\u2022 **Watch for Overpowered Terrain:** As noted under Budgeting for Terrain, some features of the environment can increase the danger drastically. Consider your creature and the environment, and see whether the creature has a massive advantage compared to PCs in that terrain, such as a monster with powerful, long-range attacks when PCs are stuck at a distance. If so, you might want to adjust.",

Consider giving each member of these tightly knit teams a reaction triggered by their allies\u2019 abilities, or another benefit they gain based on their allies\u2019 actions. Just as a team of PCs learns how to best position the rogue to flank enemies and minimize the harm they take from the wizard\u2019s *fireball* spell, NPCs can learn to complement each other\u2019s strategies and avoid interfering with each other. On the opposite end of the spectrum, opponents with poor coordination make the fight much easier for the PCs. Poor coordination between mindless creatures is common, and PCs can use clever tactics to run circles around these foes. When intelligent creatures accidentally (or deliberately) harm each other or pursue conflicting strategies, particularly if they engage in banter with each other as they fight, it can make for an amusing break in the typical rhythm of combat.",

Rather than amping up the opposition to match the PCs\u2019 firepower and creating opponents whose own offenses are too powerful for the PCs\u2019 defenses, consider a little sleight of hand. For instance, a villain might have an illusory or disguised decoy target with just enough durability to take a few hits while the true villain is hiding nearby, ready to emerge and attack. Illusion spells can allow a foe to attack from a safer position, and possession grants the foe a disposable body unless the PCs brought along spirit blast or similar magic. Sometimes you can even hide the villain in plain sight: for instance, in an encounter with three goblins with similar-looking gear and an ogre, one of the goblins might be the biggest threat, but the PCs are likely to target the ogre first.",

Environmental hazards often can be overcome with Nature or Survival, and haunts can often be overcome with Occultism or Religion. The specific skill and DC required to disable a hazard are listed in the hazard\u2019s stat block. Like using Disable a Device, using these skills to disable a trap is a 2-action activity with the same degrees of success, though the activity might have different traits determined by the GM. As with detecting a hazard, disabling a hazard might require a character to have a certain proficiency rank in the listed skill.",

That creature can try to Grab an Edge to avoid falling (Player Core 419). The DC to Climb the walls or Grab an Edge is 26.\n\nThe pit contains many handholds, so the falling creature can try to Grab an Edge again every 6 seconds. If the creature succeeds, it can start to Climb out from that point (though it might be a very long climb, depending on how far the creature fell). Since the creature falls endlessly, it can rest and even prepare spells while falling, though items dropped while falling are usually lost forever.\n\nReset The trap still causes creatures to fall forever if they fall in, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.",
