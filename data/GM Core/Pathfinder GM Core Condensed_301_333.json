An intelligent item works well when its personality makes it a natural complement or foil for its partner: the PC investing, holding, or otherwise interacting with the item. An intelligent item that can communicate only with that particular PC is also a great way to engage players who are a bit quieter, or those slower to speak in a scene where all the PCs can talk to a particular NPC. Due to their inherently limited agency, intelligent items are at less of a risk for stealing the spotlight than other NPCs who travel along with the party.",

Generally speaking,\nthis results in a relic gaining one gift for every 4 levels\nits bearer has, but this might fluctuate as the campaign\nprogresses. For example, a relic might gain its first gift at\n4th level after the bearer defeats a powerful foe. It might\nthen gain its second at 7th, after they perform a special\nritual. That same relic might not gain another gift until\n13th level and then again at 16th as the player reaches\nother major milestones.",
