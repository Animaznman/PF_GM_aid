precious material cost more than typical items; not only
does precious material cost more, but the crafter must
invest more time working with it. In addition, more
powerful items require precious materials of greater
purity. A number of precious materials are described
below. The Price entry for each material gives the Price
of a simple non-magical item made of that material,
based on its Bulk (if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk,
use the price for 1 Bulk), as well as Prices for different
amounts of the material itself. Prices for armor, shields,
and weapons made of precious material are in the Armor
(page 228), Shields (page 233), and Weapons (page 240)
sections of this chapter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.079,r=0.473,b=0.281), with ID 08e4680b-59de-4536-8364-df5ba9093616 -->

Crafting with Precious Materials  
Only an expert crafter can create a low-grade item, only a master can create a standard-grade item, and only a legendary crafter can create a high-grade item. In addition, to Craft with a precious material, your character level must be equal to or greater than that of the material. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.289,r=0.472,b=0.402), with ID 92654906-5c44-4909-b394-232c64c8e756 -->

Low-grade items can be used in the creation of magic
items of up to 8th level, and they can hold runes of up
to 8th level. Standard-grade items can be used to create
magic items of up to 15th level and can hold runes of
up to 15th level. High-grade items use the purest form
of the precious material, and can be used to Craft magic
items of any level holding any runes. Using purer forms
of common materials is so relatively inexpensive that the
Price is included in any magic item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.403,r=0.471,b=0.540), with ID e3e86a83-fdf3-4f5e-9c3c-37e850d3eb5c -->

When you Craft an item that incorporates a precious
material, your initial raw materials for the item must
include that material; at least 10% of the investment
must be of the material for low grade, at least 25% for
standard grade, and all of it for high grade. For instance, a
low-grade silver object of 1 Bulk costs 20 gp. Of the 10 gp
of raw materials you provide when you start to Craft the
item, at least 1 gp must be silver. The raw materials you
spend to complete the item don’t have to consist of the
precious material, though the GM might rule otherwise
in certain cases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.541,r=0.471,b=0.708), with ID 40e3f43d-9c3f-4cac-aa3a-731c7bf20564 -->

After creating an item with a precious material, you
can use Craft to improve its grade, paying the Price
difference and providing a sufficient amount of the
precious material. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.709,r=0.471,b=0.771), with ID 606f804b-d747-4d9f-b47c-da0836d6cf1c -->

ADAMANTINE                MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON   PRECIOUS
Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one of the hardest metals known. It has a shiny, black appearance, and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an incredibly sharp edge.

COLD IRON                MATERIAL 2+

PRECIOUS
Weapons made from cold iron are deadly to demons and fey alike. Cold iron looks like normal iron but is mined from particularly pure sources and shaped with little or no heat. This process is extremely difficult, especially for high-grade cold iron items.

DAWNSILVER                            MATERIAL 8+

UNCOMMON  PRECIOUS

Dawnsilver is renowned for its lightness, durability, and effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and werecreatures. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly lighter hue. Dawnsilver weapons and armor are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with weakness to silver. A metal item made of dawnsilver is lighter than one made of iron or steel: the item’s Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of this material is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of dawnsilver, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.720,r=0.861,b=0.939), with ID aaf490b0-3a2c-42d3-8f4a-4692c78ce9cd -->

DUSKWOOD

UNCOMMON  PRECIOUS

Duskwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old-growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but has a slight purple tint. A duskwood item’s Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of duskwood is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of duskwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.

ORICHALCUM

RARE PRECIOUS

The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn’t as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum’s time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn’t destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.

Summary : This image displays a large, bold numeral "5" centered on a textured, yellowish-brown background.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, dark brown font with a light outline.
  • The number is centered both vertically and horizontally.
  • Background is a mottled, sandy or parchment-like yellow-brown texture.
  • Lighting is even, with no visible shadows or highlights.
  • Colour palette consists mainly of brown and yellow tones.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or additional text present.
  • No UI elements or other markings.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The "5" is the only element, dominating the image.
  • No foreground or background separation; the number sits directly on the textured field.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended to highlight or label the number "5" prominently, possibly as part of a sequence or for identification purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.877,t=0.001,r=0.999,b=0.061), with ID 85dbe551-cf49-4bda-803f-81320315a7ef -->

# MOMENTARY MAGIC

*This section includes consumable magic items. An item with the consumable trait can be used only once; unless stated otherwise, it’s destroyed after activation. When a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.076,r=0.867,b=0.184), with ID 56ad5061-2143-4c38-816e-63471d0203d6 -->

# AMMUNITION
These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons. Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry that lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or “any” if it’s not limited to any particular type. All stat blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use the standard rules for the type of ammunition to determine reloading times and Bulk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.212,r=0.472,b=0.341), with ID a64b2b6f-638e-4928-bb9b-6302d0dfbcf3 -->

When using magic ammunition, use your ranged
weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack
modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your
weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states
otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic
ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition
to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.341,r=0.472,b=0.448), with ID 88b4624d-8cd8-4e03-b093-de0f92337cd2 -->

Regardless of whether an attack with magic ammunition
hits or misses, launching the ammunition consumes its
magic. Magic ammunition is made of normal materials,
not precious materials, unless stated otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.449,r=0.471,b=0.511), with ID 0c9061a9-9cab-428d-a531-946438042d53 -->

# Activated Ammunition
If magic ammunition doesn’t have an Activate entry, it’s activated automatically when it’s launched. Types of magic ammunition that have an Activate entry must be activated with additional actions before being used. Once you activate the ammunition, you must shoot it before the end of your turn. Otherwise, it deactivates (but it isn’t consumed) and you must activate it again before you can use it. If you shoot the ammunition without activating it first, it functions as non-magical ammunition and is still consumed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.520,r=0.471,b=0.677), with ID ffc33425-3928-4c83-93c6-ee13dfbd597b -->

The action required to activate the ammunition doesn’t alter how many actions it takes to reload. For example, you could activate a _beacon shot_ arrow by touching it with 1 action, then draw and shoot the arrow as part of a Strike as normal. For a _beacon shot_ bolt, you could activate it, load it into a crossbow, then shoot it, or load it into the crossbow, then activate it, and then shoot it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.679,r=0.471,b=0.786), with ID 1c7b5040-753c-4943-8631-a7463580213d -->

Price 900 gp

Ghost ammunition is cool to the touch. This ammunition has the benefits of the ghost touch property rune and can fly through any obstacle except those that can block incorporeal creatures or effects. Though the ammunition penetrates barriers and ignores all cover, the target still benefits from the flat check from being concealed or hidden. You still can’t target an undetected creature without guessing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.643,r=0.863,b=0.815), with ID 1db6265a-565b-440c-a9eb-f7ba9a1efdfd -->

Activate [figure: black diamond] Interact  
This ammunition has a slender shape and a viciously pointed  
tip. When you activate and shoot _penetrating ammunition_, the  
Strike takes the shape of a 60-foot line originating from you.  
Roll one attack roll and compare the result to the AC of each  
target in the line. The ammunition ignores up to 10 of a target’s  
resistance, and it can penetrate walls up to 1 foot thick with  
Hardness 10 or less. Each target that takes damage from this  
ammunition also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.354,r=0.515,b=0.494), with ID 0d94b57c-8045-425e-868f-298d208d7f36 -->

If your attack roll result is a natural 20, you improve your degree of success only against the first target in the line, but you can still score a critical hit on other targets if your result exceeds their AC by 10 or more. If you have access to your bow's critical specialization effect, *penetrating ammunition* applies that effect only against a target in the last square of the line. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.494,r=0.514,b=0.588), with ID 00d7ee0b-e8fe-466d-8163-7c3e0ffd606f -->

SHINING AMMUNITION ITEM 1  
CONSUMABLE LIGHT MAGICAL  
Price 3 gp  
Ammunition any  
Shining ammunition gives off a faint glow. When shot, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an Interact action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow for the rest of the duration or until destroyed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.596,r=0.514,b=0.757), with ID 3e3f8031-8f3c-46ba-8d1b-5e1dd4db93f6 -->

SPELLSTRIKE AMMUNITION                ITEM 3+

CONSUMABLE  MAGICAL
Ammunition any
Activate ◆◆ Cast a Spell
Mystic patterns create a magic reservoir within this ammunition. You activate spellstrike ammunition by Casting a Spell on the ammunition. The spell must be of a spell rank the ammunition can hold, must take 1 or 2 actions to cast, and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. A creature hit by activated spellstrike ammunition is targeted by the spell. If the creature isn’t a valid target for the spell, the spell is lost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.766,r=0.514,b=0.940), with ID b1435bd1-5a50-408b-9af2-81ec182c7525 -->

The ammunition affects only the target hit, even if the spell
would normally affect more than one target. If the spell requires
a spell attack roll, use the result of your ranged attack roll to
determine the degree of success of the spell. If the spell requires
a save, the target attempts the save against your spell DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.356,r=0.904,b=0.433), with ID 1cecac08-6f24-47fc-93be-147aaa551493 -->

**OILS**
Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are typically applied to an object (though sometimes to a creature). They’re typically found in vials (similar to potions) or small tins. They have the oil trait. Like other consumables, oils are used up when activated. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.073,r=0.473,b=0.173), with ID 226c9ddf-064d-464f-ab55-8f1d928fe3d6 -->

Applying an oil usually takes two hands: one to hold
the jar containing the oil and another to extract the
oil and apply it. You can only apply an oil to an item
or creature within your reach. Because the process is
so thorough, it is usually impossible to apply an oil to
an unwilling target or an item in the possession of an
unwilling target unless that target is paralyzed, petrified,
or unconscious. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.173,r=0.474,b=0.297), with ID a08e2f3b-7e56-491c-800d-017839ddf10b -->

The oil affects neither the magic of the armor nor the fundamental runes of weapons attacking the wearer. Magical effects from a source of 20th level or higher, such as a deity, still function on the armor’s wearer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.303,r=0.475,b=0.512), with ID 7538f561-bd81-4524-9d83-9124cf9fcead -->

# Scrolls
A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without having to expend a spell slot. A scroll can be Crafted to contain nearly any spell. The exceptions are cantrips, focus spells, and rituals, none of which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular spell rank, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a scroll of *force barrage* (1st rank) can be used to cast the 1st-rank version of *force barrage*, but not a *force barrage* heightened to 2nd rank. If no rank is listed, the scroll can be used to cast the spell at its lowest rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.073,r=0.515,b=0.265), with ID dea396cb-e354-4129-9554-f00402d0ccd8 -->

If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell it
contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell list or
a spell you know, you can spend a single Recall Knowledge
action and automatically succeed at
identifying the scroll’s spell. If it’s
not, you must Identify Magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.264,r=0.517,b=0.360), with ID 8a290f59-3aa8-46f7-95c2-69040606115c -->

Summary : This image displays a stat block for a magic item called "Scroll of Illusory Disguise" from a tabletop roleplaying game, detailing its properties, usage, and crafting requirements.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a formatted rules text box for a magic scroll item.
  • The item is titled "Scroll of Illusory Disguise" and is labeled as "ITEM 1".
  • The scroll contains a 1st-rank illusory disguise spell.

Technical Details :
  • Tags: CONSUMABLE, ILLUSION, MAGICAL, SCROLL (all in red boxes).
  • Price: 4 gp.
  • Usage: held in 1 hand; Bulk L.
  • Activate: Two-action symbol (⟨⟨) Cast a Spell.
  • Effect: "You cast illusory disguise as a 1st-rank spell."
  • Craft Requirements: "Supply one casting of illusory disguise."
  • Example header: "EXAMPLE MAGIC SCROLL" with a brief description.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The information is organized in a top-down, sectioned format with bolded headers and boxed tags for quick reference.
  • Price, usage, and activation details are grouped together for clarity.

Analysis :
  • The image provides a clear, concise reference for players or game masters regarding the use and creation of a specific magic scroll, emphasizing its cost, activation method, and crafting prerequisites. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.071,r=0.906,b=0.283), with ID 4711dd29-6a44-4dde-882b-3869aa2b3bdc -->

process, choose a spell to put into the scroll.
You must either Cast that Spell during
the crafting process, or someone else
must do so in your presence. Casting
that spell doesn’t produce its normal
effects; instead, the magic is trapped inside
the scroll. The casting must come from
a spellcaster expending a spell slot.
You can’t Craft a scroll from a spell
produced from another magic item,
for example. The caster must provide
any cost of the spell. A scroll’s rarity
is the same as that of the spell it
contains.
Like other consumables, scrolls can
be crafted in batches of four. All scrolls
of one batch must contain the same
spell at the same rank, and you must
provide one casting for each scroll that is
crafted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.294,r=0.908,b=0.602), with ID 62ac5362-736d-4160-805f-5b1909b81e7f -->

Casting a Spell from a Scroll

Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for that spell. The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you’re the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.366,r=0.476,b=0.542), with ID 8acc47ac-06f3-43b6-995d-de163d8d24a8 -->

Any physical costs are provided when a scroll is
created, so you don’t need to provide them when
casting from a scroll. If the spell requires a locus, you
must have that locus to Cast the Spell from a scroll. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.541,r=0.487,b=0.604), with ID 60caf83d-c7de-4fab-a6f6-cdfc724fc055 -->

## Scroll Statistics
All scrolls have the same base statistics unless noted otherwise. A scroll has light Bulk and must be held in one hand to be activated. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.612,r=0.514,b=0.679), with ID 06da5e88-3d17-40d0-9a61-da6626825e28 -->

Varying Statistics  
The magic scroll stat block indicates the item level and Price of a scroll, both of which are based on the rank of the spell in the scroll. Any costs to Cast the Spell are added to the scroll’s Price when the scroll is crafted, so a scroll containing a spell with a Cost entry will have a higher Price than what’s on the table. The scroll’s rarity matches the spell’s rarity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.690,r=0.513,b=0.800), with ID 967ccb16-6607-47a0-9026-edec0a460adf -->

The traits for a scroll vary based on the spell it contains.
A scroll always has the consumable, magical, and scroll
traits, plus any traits that might be relevant to identifying
the item, such as illusion or fire. The GM determines the
extra traits, if necessary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.801,r=0.514,b=0.878), with ID aa25f80d-3afc-43a6-b728-6717c018d083 -->

Crafting a Scroll  
The process to Craft a scroll is much like that to Craft any other magic item. When you begin the crafting <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.888,r=0.515,b=0.942), with ID 01853371-f4ef-4ea6-abe5-6dc2f9bb6a34 -->

## Magic Scroll
A scroll’s Price and level are based on the spell. The name is simply “scroll of,” followed by the spell’s name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.611,r=0.906,b=0.667), with ID ea8ae51c-a362-49fa-932f-9d4eb9644a19 -->

TALISMANS  
An item with the talisman trait is a magical charm, gem, stone, or other small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). Each talisman holds a sliver of combat knowledge or magical energy that can be unleashed for a momentary boost of power or enhanced ability. Many talismans can be activated as a free action when you use a particular action or activity. A talisman is a consumable item and has the talisman trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.075,r=0.473,b=0.219), with ID b23f018d-0405-41a0-a1c5-c8428bfbcd97 -->

Summary : This is a vertical illustration featuring the coiled body of a dragon with a knight flying nearby, set against a pale background with ornate gold-trimmed borders.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a serpentine dragon with a spiked, scaled body, curving from the upper left to the center.
  • A small armored knight riding a flying creature (possibly a griffin or wyvern) is positioned near the dragon’s midsection.
  • The background is pale, possibly cloudy or misty, with a fantasy aesthetic.
  • The top and upper sides are bordered with ornate gold trim, including a decorative point at the bottom of the illustrated section.
  • The lower portion of the crop is a solid dark brown vertical panel, likely for text or additional content.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar, text, or UI elements within the illustrated area.

  • The knight is much smaller, emphasizing the dragon’s scale.
  • The illustrated section occupies the top quarter; the rest is a blank, dark brown vertical panel.

  • The ornate border and empty lower panel indicate this is likely a decorative sidebar or frame from a game, book, or card. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.001,t=0.009,r=0.127,b=0.531), with ID a4a11d65-c266-4f80-b4da-591509cedd46 -->

Activate [figure: black diamond] (manipulate)
This blueberry-sized bead appears to be a sphere of glass with a flickering light at its core. In truth, the “glass” is a bubble of solidified time magic, containing suspended lava at the exact point before a volcanic eruption. When activated, it becomes a tiny beacon of bright light before unleashing its power. After you Activate frozen lava, it quickly heats up. If you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM’s discretion, you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the bead by the start of your next turn, it pops like an ostentatious but harmless firework. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.412,r=0.515,b=0.662), with ID d7d4e6a0-47d0-42ad-a50b-8aa5bba17d9e -->

Every marvelous miniature is an exceptionally small replica of a real creature or object. The miniature is made from wood, pewter, or other simple materials, and features a rune etched into the underside of the replica’s base. Marvelous miniatures sometimes come packaged together; for example, the camping set features the boat, campfire, and horse miniatures.

Once the chest is closed, it transforms again—this time into a key—taking all of the stored items with it.

# TRAPPINGS OF POWER

*This section includes magic items that you wear. Most of the items have the invested trait, described on page 219, which means you can wear no more than 10 of the item. If the “worn” usage for an item is followed by another word, like “worn belt,” you’re limited to wearing only one item of that type. If nothing’s listed after “worn,” as in the case of rings, you can wear any number.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.077,r=0.907,b=0.199), with ID 123bc530-eac1-410a-878f-3f1cdb5dcb68 -->

Apex Items  
When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attributes, either increasing the attribute’s modifier by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever would give you a higher score. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture runs out: increasing Intelligence lets you become trained in an additional skill and learn a new language, increasing Constitution gives you more Hit Points, and so on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.228,r=0.515,b=0.387), with ID 6b05b30e-82f7-41cf-812b-941a6937c2d0 -->

An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s
invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit
from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt
to invest an apex item when you already have one
invested, you don’t gain the attribute modifier increase,
though you do gain any other effects of Investing
the Item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.387,r=0.515,b=0.494), with ID 25023afa-6f46-4bb1-b4d5-c315a9f981ec -->

## Companion Items
You might want to acquire items that benefit a creature that assists you, such as an animal companion, familiar, or bonded animal. These items have the companion trait, meaning they function only for animal companions, familiars, and similar creatures. Normally, these are the only items a companion can use. Other items can qualify at the GM’s discretion, but a companion can never Activate an Item. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.218), with ID 90743a87-859f-4985-b876-dfe131eea4f6 -->

Any worn companion item needs to be invested. However, your companion needs to invest it, rather than you doing so. This requires you to use the Invest an Item activity alongside your companion, helping them attune to the item and ensuring it is properly fit. A companion has an investiture limit of two items (instead of the 10- item limit a player character has). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.219,r=0.516,b=0.328), with ID 9e6de6bb-fb9a-4b46-a456-5d7e0c920490 -->

THE STRUCTURE TRAIT  
An item with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure's foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.148,t=0.088,r=0.504,b=0.325), with ID be066922-d7e1-4169-be5b-d108497d1e49 -->

The structure doesn’t harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can’t be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when the item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when the activation ends isn’t harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.326,r=0.504,b=0.462), with ID e2c90329-5a91-47a3-8f8d-fc006d5968cd -->

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
Though it appears to be a cloth bag decorated with panels of richly colored silk or stylish embroidery, a spacious pouch opens into a magical space larger than its outside dimensions. The Bulk held inside the bag doesn’t change the Bulk of the spacious pouch itself.

You can Interact with the _spacious pouch_ to stow items in it or remove them just like a mundane sack. Though the bag can hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.709,r=0.903,b=0.784), with ID 76d26d99-2167-488b-bad2-20a69976d20e -->

If the bag is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it’s turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the bag has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the bag provides no benefits unless it’s retrieved first. An item in the bag can’t be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.786,r=0.902,b=0.923), with ID 4fcb2625-893c-4d11-b389-29c5992f16f1 -->

# STAVES
A magical staff is an indispensable accessory for a spellcaster. A staff is tied to a person during a preparation process, after which the preparer, and only the preparer, can use the staff to produce magic. The spells that can be cast from a staff are listed in bullet points organized by rank. Staves can be found in multiple types, with more powerful types containing more spells—such a staff always contains the spells of all lower-level types of the staff, in addition to the spells listed in its own entry. All magical staves have the staff trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.236), with ID d8a11343-36bb-4e57-8494-f9ac4eb8abb7 -->

Casting Spells from a Staff  
A staff gains charges when someone prepares it for the day. The person who prepared a staff can expend the charges to cast spells from it. You can Cast a Spell from a staff only if you have that spell on your spell list, are able to cast spells of the appropriate rank or higher, and expend a number of charges from the staff equal to the spell’s rank. Casting a Spell from a staff requires holding the staff (typically in one hand) and Activating the staff by Casting the Spell, which takes the spell’s normal number of actions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.243,r=0.515,b=0.402), with ID 59e57e4c-979e-4235-bf26-991947c3526e -->

Use your spell attack modifier and spell DC when
Casting a Spell from a staff. The spell gains the appropriate
trait for your magical tradition and can be affected by
any modifications you can normally make when casting
spells, such as spellshape feats. You must provide any cost
or locus required by the spell, or you fail to cast it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.403,r=0.514,b=0.494), with ID fa294417-88ca-49fe-8430-8bf66f94056f -->

Prepared spellcasters and spontaneous spellcasters
each have a unique way of altering how their staves gain
charges and the ways they can be used (see the Prepared
Spellcasters and Spontaneous Spellcasters sections below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.495,r=0.514,b=0.558), with ID 986afd04-8946-467f-ac32-a7defedcd481 -->

Casting Cantrips from a Staff  
You can cast a cantrip from a staff without expending any charges, heightened to the same rank as cantrips you cast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.568,r=0.513,b=0.619), with ID 2c03432c-9606-4298-9049-52b7cc5617dc -->

Preparing a Staff
During your daily preparations, you can prepare a staff to add charges to it for free. When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the rank of your highest spell slot. You don’t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way. No one can prepare more than one staff per day, nor can a staff be prepared by more than one person per day. If the charges aren’t used within 24 hours, they’re lost, and preparing the staff anew removes any charges previously stored in it. You can prepare a staff only if you have at least one of the staff’s spells on your spell list. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.629,r=0.514,b=0.802), with ID bb4d3b5f-1c03-4a45-851d-170817bfc3f4 -->

Prepared Spellcasters  
A prepared spellcaster—such as a cleric, druid, witch, or wizard—can place some of their own magic in a staff to increase its number of charges. When a prepared spellcaster prepares a staff, they can expend a spell slot to add a number of charges equal to the rank of the spell. They can’t expend more than one spell in this way each day. For example, if a wizard can cast 3rd-rank spells and prepared a staff, the staff <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.814,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 81b2d61b-8abe-40f6-bccf-3cd8ea1f4377 -->

would gain 3 charges, but wizard could increase this to 6
by expending one of their 3rd-rank spells, 5 by expending a
2nd-rank spell, or 4 by expending a 1st-rank spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.080,r=0.904,b=0.128), with ID bdf13348-1f1c-4538-92b5-3af0947e0122 -->

Spontaneous Spellcasters  
A spontaneous spellcaster—such as a bard, oracle, or sorcerer—can reduce the number of charges it takes to Activate a staff by supplementing it with their own energy. When a spontaneous spellcaster Activates a staff, they can expend 1 charge from the staff and one of their spell slots to cast a spell from the staff of the same rank (or lower) as the expended spell slot. This doesn’t change the number of actions it takes to cast the spell. For example, if a sorcerer can cast 3rd-rank spells and prepared a staff, the staff would gain 3 charges. They could expend 1 charge and one of their 3rd-rank spell slots to cast a 3rd-rank spell from the staff, or 1 charge and one of their 2nd-rank spell slots to cast a 2nd-rank spell from the staff. They could still expend 3 charges from the staff to cast a 3rd-rank spell from it without using any of their own slots, just like any other spellcaster. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.140,r=0.905,b=0.388), with ID e347d38b-e9ef-4acf-ac1c-2d683fe73efd -->

  • The motif appears to be ornamental, possibly from a border, header, or decorative panel.

Technical Details : 
  • No text, scale bar, or numeric information is present.
  • The design uses clean, smooth lines and a limited color palette (dark green, dark brown, beige/light gold).

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The central diamond is flanked symmetrically by the arched shapes.
  • The design is horizontally aligned, with the motif occupying the upper portion of the image.

Analysis : 
  • The symmetrical arrangement and stylized forms suggest an ornamental or heraldic purpose, possibly for framing or accentuating another element in a larger composition.
  • The use of contrasting colors and geometric shapes draws attention to the central diamond, emphasizing balance and formality. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.920,r=0.999,b=0.957), with ID 1f5fb4cc-3947-462e-a5f2-ea1fc5ad776b -->

WANDS  
Short, slender items typically made of wood, wands let you cast a specific spell without expending a spell slot. They can be used once per day, but can be overcharged to attempt to cast them again at great risk. Each wand holds a spell of a certain rank, determined when the wand is created. Cantrips, focus spells, and rituals can’t be placed in wands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.515,b=0.203), with ID e0b2e394-b0ed-45dc-b42c-d66ce18844ba -->

If you find a wand, you can try to deduce what spell
is in it. If the spell is a common spell from your spell
list or is a spell you know, you can use a single Recall
Knowledge action and automatically succeed. If it’s not,
you must Identify Magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.203,r=0.514,b=0.281), with ID 24040f36-8410-467d-b402-f0c9b1e02235 -->

## Casting Spells from a Wand
A wand contains a spell that can be cast once per day. Casting a spell from a wand requires holding the wand in one hand and activating the item with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for the spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.290,r=0.513,b=0.372), with ID 370ed8a1-0808-48bd-a39e-1e5cd1054729 -->

To cast a spell from a wand, it must be on your spell
list. Because you’re the one casting the spell, use your
spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell is of your
spellcasting tradition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.372,r=0.512,b=0.433), with ID 447b1e06-0c72-49b4-8dd8-5881512be233 -->

If a spell requires a locus, you must still have that
locus to cast the spell from a wand, and if the spell has
a cost, you must still pay that cost to cast the spell from
a wand. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.434,r=0.513,b=0.494), with ID 20a2922e-cd62-486c-ac27-3be676e860aa -->

Overcharging a Wand  
After the spell is cast from the wand for the day, you can attempt to cast it one more time—overcharging the wand at the risk of destroying it. Cast the Spell again, then roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the wand is broken. On a failure, the wand is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wand when it’s already been overcharged that day, the wand is automatically destroyed (even if it had been repaired) and no spell is cast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.506,r=0.513,b=0.648), with ID b226b5b8-70fc-4ef4-8021-730a1b506748 -->

Wand Statistics  
A wand’s base statistics are the same unless noted otherwise in a special wand. It has light Bulk, and must be held in one hand to be activated. Each wand contains a specific rank of the spell, but you can craft a wand with a heightened version of a spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.659,r=0.513,b=0.755), with ID a7cea5a2-3ec1-4d4a-b785-6dc683893d06 -->

Varying Statistics  
Each type of wand has a level and Price determined by the spell’s rank. The wand’s rarity matches the spell’s rarity, and it has its spell’s traits. A wand has the normal Hardness, BT, and HP of a thin item of its material (see page 252). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.767,r=0.512,b=0.862), with ID 80afb034-44c7-45ff-8c61-b4e89808b9fb -->

The traits for a wand vary based on the spell it
contains. A wand always has the magical and wand
traits, plus any traits that might be relevant to identifying
the item, such as illusion or fire. The GM determines the
extra traits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.863,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 1916e999-1d35-4516-9fe2-b09ffa55d928 -->

Crafting a Wand  
For the most part, the process to Craft a wand is like that to Craft any other magic item. When you begin the crafting process, choose a spell to put into the wand. You have to either cast that spell during the process, or someone else must do so in your presence. That spell doesn’t have its normal effects; instead, the magic is captured inside the wand. The caster doesn’t need to pay any cost of the spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.904,b=0.218), with ID 11cc38a2-f823-4ed1-9c83-d015d472ff43 -->

The casting must come from a spellcaster expending a
spell slot. You can't make a wand from a spell that comes
from another magic item, for example. A wand's rarity is
the same as that of the spell it contains. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.220,r=0.904,b=0.279), with ID 4691a340-51a7-4ea4-becf-bdd7594ba3f8 -->

Magic Wand  
The simplest form of wand contains a spell, with Price and level based on that spell. The name of a magic wand with a spell in it is simply “wand of,” followed by the spell’s name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.291,r=0.903,b=0.372), with ID 6dc1a90d-ef7c-44dc-933b-b8ed6818e0e6 -->

Usage worn; Bulk –

Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.643,r=0.513,b=0.770), with ID c33504a2-1bc0-4ac9-9977-46e1a3098de9 -->

When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.770,r=0.513,b=0.877), with ID a2f645b8-69eb-4dc9-af64-0c0e89d0c1d9 -->

Summary : This illustration shows several fantasy role-playing game magic items, specifically aeon stones and handwraps of mighty blows, with their names labeled.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image displays five distinct objects: three geometric stones (a translucent cube, a purple cube, a green oval, and a red star-shaped gem) grouped together, and a red and gold decorated handwrap.
  • The objects are labeled as "AEON STONES" (for the four stones) and "HANDWRAPS OF MIGHTY BLOWS" (for the handwrap).
  • The background is a plain light tan color, and the items are arranged with the stones on the left and the handwrap on the right.

Technical Details :
  • The aeon stones are depicted in different shapes and colors: a clear cube, a purple cube, a green oval, and a red star.
  • The handwrap is red with gold and white runic markings, and appears padded at the knuckles.

  • The labels are placed directly below or beside the corresponding items.

DOUBLING RINGS                                                                 ITEM 3+

INVESTED  MAGICAL
Usage worn; Bulk –
This item consists of two magically linked rings: an intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon’s fundamental runes are replicated onto any melee weapon you wield in the hand wearing the iron ring. (The fundamental runes are weapon potency and striking, which add an item bonus to attack rolls and extra weapon damage dice, respectively.) Any fundamental runes on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.302,r=0.476,b=0.495), with ID b2ced9df-2b4d-4ccd-ac95-24c47cddb7a8 -->

The replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it
ends as soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of
your hands. Consequently, the benefit doesn’t apply to thrown
attacks or if you’re holding a weapon but not wielding it (such as
holding in one hand a weapon that requires two hands to wield).
**Type** doubling rings; **Level** 3; **Price** 50 gp  
**Type** greater doubling rings; **Level** 11; **Price** 1,300 gp  
The rings also replicate property runes from the weapon
in the gold-ringed hand, so long as the weapon in the iron-
ringed hand meets all the prerequisites for a given rune
and is not a specific weapon. The weapon in the iron-ringed
hand gains the benefits of those runes. All its own runes are
suppressed. When you invest the rings, you can elect for the
rings to transfer only fundamental runes, in which case they
function as standard doubling rings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.495,r=0.476,b=0.726), with ID ed2724e5-74a8-4fbf-a377-a8a58380a40f -->

HANDWRAPS OF MIGHTY BLOWS                ITEM 2+

INVESTED  MAGICAL
Usage worn gloves; Bulk –

As you invest these embroidered strips of cloth, you must meditate and slowly wrap them around your hands. These handwraps have weapon runes etched into them to give your unarmed attacks the benefits of those runes, making your unarmed attacks work like magic weapons. For example, +1 striking handwraps of mighty blows would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.458,r=0.515,b=0.677), with ID 591f0abd-992f-49f5-8bef-c25dc024e268 -->

You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you’re using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn’t function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.678,r=0.514,b=0.831), with ID e7fba018-99db-41ac-b9ac-c683d4442493 -->

An indentation in the middle of the *wayfinder* can hold a single *aeon stone* (page 284). Placing an *aeon stone* in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the *aeon stone* orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a *wayfinder* and the *aeon stone* within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit.

  • The logo’s symmetry and use of abstract human forms suggest themes of unity, partnership, or community.
  • The gold color may convey a sense of prestige or tradition.
  • The absence of text or specific branding elements means the logo’s affiliation is not identifiable from this crop alone. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.920,r=1.000,b=0.959), with ID 142d630c-9ad4-4b1f-8689-b926d065e320 -->

GEMS & ART OBJECTS

Many people treasure gems for their brilliant colors and for the alchemical or even magical properties some have. Works of art and their value, meanwhile, vary as widely as the concept of beauty between cultures. They may be more elegant versions of useful items, or exist solely to be admired and envied. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.077,r=0.909,b=0.184), with ID d794286f-f6d9-4879-848b-756fd34ca604 -->

Much like coins, gems and art objects are valuable currency worth their full Price when sold. When making a treasure hoard, you can choose gems or art objects you like, or roll randomly using percentile dice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.217,r=0.516,b=0.282), with ID 5798ccdf-4fc0-4888-af73-e95c7f99df94 -->

Gems
Gems are naturally occurring minerals, typically in a crystalline form, or, in a few cases, organic material such as amber, coral, and pearls. All but the largest gems weigh about half as much as a coin, so about 2,000 gems is 1 Bulk. Unworked gems are worth half the Price of a finished gem and can serve as the minimum raw materials necessary to Craft the finished gem. Lesser semiprecious stones are level 0 items, moderate and greater semiprecious stones are 1st-level items, lesser and moderate precious stones are 4th-level items that require expert proficiency to Craft, and greater precious stones are 7th-level items that require master proficiency to Craft. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.291,r=0.515,b=0.495), with ID 70ee4ee4-5876-43ad-92fe-9d035e3d0df3 -->

Art Objects
These pieces of artwork have listed Prices, but might be more valuable to a collector or someone with a personal connection. Consider whether the PCs could discover this information and secure a greater reward. For instance, a dwarven crown might be worth 1,000 gp for its exquisite crafting, but even more to the dwarves who lost the crown of their first queen long ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.674,r=0.904,b=0.800), with ID 4ddf5553-e13d-4abe-8df7-c16b43647313 -->

On the other hand, the materials used to make an art
object, such as the paint and the canvas of a painting, are
worth far less than the finished object. Some art objects on
the following tables include uncommon or rare precious
materials, though usually not in large enough amounts for
other crafting purposes. If you’re rolling randomly and
don’t want to give out an uncommon or rare material, roll
again or modify the description (for instance, you might
change a dawnsilver crown to a gold crown). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.802,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 54c4c7b9-d659-4c38-8bc7-2689afcdddee -->

Summary : This image shows a user interface element displaying the number "299" within a decorative border, likely representing a score, currency, or resource count in a game.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is the number "299" in large, bold, brown text on a tan rectangular background.
  • The rectangle is bordered on the left by a green, jagged edge.
  • Above the number is a decorative motif: a green background with tan and green symmetrical shapes, including a central diamond and two stylized human figures or antlers on either side.
  • The overall colour palette is green, tan, and brown.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, units, or additional UI elements visible.
  • No explicit labels or icons indicating the exact meaning of "299".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "299" is centered horizontally within the tan rectangle.
  • The decorative motif is directly above the number, occupying the upper portion of the image.

Analysis :
  • The design suggests this is a resource or score counter from a game interface, with the decorative motif possibly indicating a faction, theme, or achievement. The number "299" is the primary focus. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.898,t=0.921,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID e81ce817-5df5-4434-84ba-d78deee16828 -->

# ARTIFACTS

*A globe of utter darkness that consumes all things. Powerful weapons created in antiquity carrying the hopes of an entire people. A simple deck of cards representing fortunes both transcendent and deadly. These are artifacts—items of incredible power, spoken of in thousands of stories and beyond the capability of modern people to create.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.079,r=0.910,b=0.186), with ID fe58530e-a823-45ee-b9c0-6a136ddebd2d -->

Stranger and more powerful than other magic items, artifacts can change the course of history in the right hands—or the wrong hands. Simply finding an artifact is a pivotal moment in your campaign, and its presence then ripples throughout your entire game, warping the story around it. Some entire adventures revolve around one artifact! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.218,r=0.515,b=0.325), with ID eeb51129-c534-4773-bb26-e27583659974 -->

Adding an artifact to your game should never be
taken lightly. Artifacts shouldn’t be found in normal
treasure hoards, even at 20th level, and you’ll need
to structure moments in your plot that play into the
artifact’s presence. Prepare yourself for encounters being
easily overcome by the artifact. That doesn’t mean you
shouldn’t include such encounters, since part of the thrill
of an artifact is that it breaks the normal rules! Though
you should include an artifact mindfully, you should
allow it to have its full impact so that it can do itself and
the story of your game justice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.326,r=0.514,b=0.495), with ID e2324437-6a49-4f7e-9e24-6f85da6dce64 -->

## Artifact Rules
Every artifact is an item with the artifact trait. This trait means two things: the item can’t be crafted or have its runes adjusted by normal means, and it can’t be damaged by normal means. Artifacts are always rare or unique. The ones found here are all 20th level or higher, which is typical for artifacts. The other rules for wearing or using the item still apply. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.505,r=0.514,b=0.633), with ID b2c07418-2612-40ac-b513-b60468694d40 -->

Artifact Destruction  
An artifact’s stat block usually has a destruction entry. This details the extraordinary method needed to destroy the item. These entries can be highly specific. It could take completing an entire quest, or even an entire campaign, to finally destroy an artifact. However, the story of your game might require something different, so you can always change an artifact’s destruction requirement for your game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.643,r=0.513,b=0.787), with ID 14ce9b6a-fe93-4a08-bd3e-3d68e867f185 -->

# Creating an Artifact
Mechanically, an artifact functions in the game just like any other item—only the scope of its abilities is different. Artifacts can and should do things normal items can’t, so you don’t need to apply the normal limitations on creating items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.796,r=0.514,b=0.892), with ID 2caf9828-b5d3-4418-88fb-771056fb6054 -->

When you’re making an artifact, start by defining its
role in the story. Is it meant to be a powerful weapon
against the forces of darkness? A mercurial force <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.893,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 898a1fe8-03fd-40ab-95c6-5a6d8b8bd45a -->

injecting random chance? A terrible danger that needs to
be destroyed? The artifact’s role in the story affects the
features you give it. Come up with some story beats that
make sense for the item, then create abilities that enable
those moments. An artifact can have more abilities than
a typical item—just make sure they all fit its theme. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.219,r=0.904,b=0.310), with ID cddde654-4d93-4162-b4e9-196f85f2e279 -->

Give your item the artifact trait and either the rare
trait (if there multiple items of its kind), or the unique
trait (if only one exists). Other traits work like they do
for any other item. An artifact is usually 20th level or
higher, but its specific level is up to you. Imagine who
created it and what their level likely was. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.311,r=0.903,b=0.402), with ID 6d97a2d7-1f5b-4b46-b24a-8acd17fd7b7a -->

Though you can disregard most of the normal
limitations on items, be careful not to create an artifact
that will undermine your story. If your item’s abilities
are so useful or strong that the best option in any battle
is to always use the artifact to annihilate the opposition,
the artifact has taken over your story instead of serving
it. A 5th-level character with access to 10th-rank spells
through an artifact can lead to incredible stories, but
if the DC is so high that enemies are guaranteed to
critically fail against those spells except on a natural
20, the item will probably distort play more than you
intended. To avoid this, you might set the item’s DCs,
attack bonuses, and the spell ranks of its offensive
abilities significantly lower than they would be for an
item of its level, especially if they can be used at will.
You could also create artifacts that use the wielder’s spell
DC instead of having their own DC, to make them more
broadly usable at a wider range of levels. In addition, an
artifact’s abilities should be somewhat narrow in their
application; aim to make your artifacts very powerful in
certain situations, rather than having broadly applicable
abilities. For instance, Serithtial deals additional damage
against creatures that are worshippers of Zon-Kuthon,
which makes the weapon very effective when facing
those creatures, but not against every foe the PCs run
across. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.404,r=0.903,b=0.799), with ID f0abe579-ab20-4954-ac47-46e04af7e8a2 -->

Summary : This image displays a large, bold numeral "5" centered on a textured, tan-colored background.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is the number "5" in a thick, dark brown font with a light outline.
  • The background is a mottled, sandy tan color with a rough texture.
  • The number is centered both vertically and horizontally in the frame.
  • Lighting appears even, with no visible shadows or highlights.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or additional text present.
  • No UI elements or photographic artifacts.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The "5" occupies the central area, with ample space around it.
  • No foreground or background elements other than the textured surface.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended to emphasize the number "5" for identification, labeling, or illustrative purposes. The high contrast and central placement make the numeral immediately noticeable. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.876,t=0.003,r=0.998,b=0.060), with ID 3607f5db-a6e2-4ab3-8e01-f09f3e55de8a -->

and strategy, and shared with his greatest artisans and
warriors. Torag designed a small number of these seals as gifts
to allied deities; each one is nearly identical but has a different
spell effect when using the reaction activation; for instance,
Sarenrae’s seal casts *sunburst* instead of *earthquake*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.078,r=0.472,b=0.157), with ID 435ace61-b96e-4683-8c26-b68c61d7e013 -->

A seal constantly rings with the quiet sound of a hammer striking an anvil when etched onto a runestone. A Forgefather’s seal can be etched only onto armor that can bear two or more property runes, and it is so powerful that it takes the place of two property runes. While wearing armor etched with a Forgefather’s seal, you gain fire resistance 40. You ignore the armor’s check penalty and Speed penalty (if any); if the armor is light or medium, increase its item bonus to AC by 1. In addition, any shield you wield automatically recovers 10 Hit Points at the start of your turn each round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.158,r=0.472,b=0.310), with ID 03cee734-20ed-4c08-9603-164fc483a5da -->

Activate—Retributive Rebuff 🔄 (manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Trigger You are hit by an attack; Effect The Forgefather’s seal glows and your armor shakes as it absorbs the blow. The attack’s damage is reduced by 100 and you cast earthquake (DC 40), centered directly on the triggering creature. You decide the area of the earthquake when you Cast the Spell, from as small as the size of the creature and up to a 60-foot burst. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.311,r=0.472,b=0.433), with ID 80ac1eb0-a925-4f7d-a5d4-52b5f7995af0 -->

Activate—Seal of Mending ➌ (manipulate) Frequency once per day; Effect You call upon on the restorative powers of the seal to repair an item within reach. The rune instantly restores the item to full Hit Points, even if the item was destroyed, using the effects of the remake spell, so long as the majority of the item is available for the repair. The seal can restore even magic items and artifacts of its level or lower. Once you have used this ability, the seal’s ability to automatically repair shields becomes inactive until the next time you make your daily preparations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.434,r=0.472,b=0.586), with ID 8b92b8de-b109-44a0-955f-a9bf5bf2fcce -->

Activate—Stalwart Sacrifice (concentrate) Trigger You have not acted yet on your turn; Effect You call upon Torag to defend your allies and those around you, sacrificing yourself in the process. Creatures of your choosing within 60 feet recover all their Hit Points. If any of the creatures are dead, they are instead brought back to life with half of their maximum Hit Points. The chosen creatures also gain a +4 status bonus to AC and saving throws, and fast healing 15 for 1 hour. You can use this ability to bring back to life a creature that requires a wish ritual or divine intervention to raise from the dead, as long as you choose no other creatures within 60 feet to recover. Once you use this activation, you are turned into a perfect statue made from stone or metal that depicts you in a glorious pose honoring your sacrifice, and you can never be restored. The Forgetfather’s seal remains on this statue and can be transferred to another suit of armor or a runestone as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.587,r=0.471,b=0.859), with ID 69c94546-0600-400f-8272-a5ef665ce75d -->

**Destruction** Using the *Forgefather's seal* ability to bring the dead back to life on an evil demigod causes it to shatter in a violent explosion that destroys the seal and the statue made as part of the sacrifice, erasing all knowledge of the user from existence. It does, however, bring the demigod back to life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.861,r=0.471,b=0.939), with ID 5d69f351-8057-4dc0-8545-8b1be0c383f2 -->

MIRROR OF SORSHEN                                    ITEM 25

UNIQUE   ARTIFACT   MAGICAL

Usage bonded (see below); Bulk L
The silvery glass of this oval mirror displays alluring sights. Its dark wooden frame is studded with small green gems and is carved with a pair of sensuous humanoid shapes—one on the edge of each side of the glass. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.076,r=0.862,b=0.188), with ID efbf41ba-292a-4ff6-8f5e-1af496e10bcb -->

The Mirror of Sorshen can form a bond with a spellcaster
who has legendary proficiency in Arcana or Occultism, who
becomes the mirror’s owner. Regardless of where the mirror is,
as long as the bond remains, the owner is aware of everything
the mirror is currently reflecting and can use the mirror’s
activations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.189,r=0.861,b=0.279), with ID 40b63b89-c60a-4ec1-9dbe-bdf47f491a88 -->

Whenever an intelligent creature looks in the mirror, they see an image of a person, creature, or item they find powerfully enticing in some way. The specific image varies depending on the observer, even when more than one creature is looking into the mirror at the same time. Observers are fascinated by the images in the mirror unless they succeed at a DC 35 Will save each round. On a failure, they stare blankly at the mirror for as long as it remains in view, and if it leaves their view, they stare toward the last place they saw the mirror for several minutes thereafter. This is an emotion, incapacitation, and visual effect. Creatures that are fascinated by the mirror are so deeply entranced that they don’t end their fascinated condition automatically even if a creature uses hostile actions against them or their allies; instead, they can attempt a DC 30 Will save to end the fascination. At the GM’s discretion, a truly innocent creature or a creature that has renounced all worldly pleasures might be immune to the mirror’s fascination. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.282,r=0.861,b=0.539), with ID 81897142-00a7-4fe3-8bbd-688c2b462ca5 -->

Activate—Irresistible Desire  ➌➌➌ (concentrate, emotion, incapacitation, mental) Requirements The target must be fascinated by the mirror; Effect You control the target for 30 days, with the effect of a critically failed saving throw against dominate. If the victim sees the mirror again at any point before this duration expires, the control extends for an additional 30 days from the moment it looked at the mirror again. While there is no initial saving throw, the DC to break free due to commands against the creature’s nature is 35. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.618,r=0.860,b=0.754), with ID 06af03ee-49e5-4808-8daa-238080ebf97b -->

Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is a decorative emblem with two symmetrical abstract human-like shapes, a central diamond, and the number "301" prominently displayed.
  • Colour palette: dark green, brown, and beige/gold.
  • The number "301" is in bold, dark brown text on a beige background with a green border.
Technical Details : 
  • No company name, tagline, or explicit branding visible.
  • No scale bar or measurement units.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The emblem is centered at the top, with the number "301" below it.
  • The design is horizontally symmetrical.
Analysis : 
  • The use of gold and green suggests a premium or achievement-related context, but no explicit brand or further meaning is conveyed in the image alone. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.897,t=0.921,r=1.000,b=0.983), with ID 4dde1c29-11c5-4acf-8a69-fa85ab0f34a2 -->

When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist’s fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.078,r=0.516,b=0.218), with ID f2d00bd2-927b-4e7b-ad1b-30f42bb60c74 -->

Activate—Accelerated Synthesis ��� (manipulate) Frequency once per minute; Effect You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor can create 56 levels’ worth of items per day in this way. For example, the extractor could create two true elixirs of life (19th level) and two moderate elixirs of life (9th level), or eight comprehension elixirs (7th level), and so on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.219,r=0.515,b=0.340), with ID 24fc21b1-e5e3-481f-9848-f51fe91ceb89 -->

Activate—Essence Transmogrification 1 hour (manipulate)
Effect You take a sizable portion of a creature (at least two-thirds of its original mass) and filter it through the mechanisms of the extractor. After the end of the process, the philosopher’s extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature’s unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon’s breath, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature’s DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature’s physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.342,r=0.514,b=0.646), with ID fc55a6b8-45f1-406b-8ba7-4cfc4970eb5e -->

Unlike normal for mutagens and polymorph effects,
you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and
gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying
mutagens made from different creatures, you receive
abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple
transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of
creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls,
you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying
mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from
that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional
concoction you drink. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.647,r=0.514,b=0.815), with ID b8882a20-b061-4f7c-ad9b-c195f51a6a15 -->

However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you’ve consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.816,r=0.515,b=0.940), with ID 8dda7729-0cbc-4869-a98e-5de155c1b0d2 -->

Destruction  Simultaneously feeding the philosopher’s extractor sizable portions of an aeon, angel, archon, azata, daemon, demon, devil, protean, and psychopomp, each of at least 14th level, along with a philosopher’s stone causes the device to jam, overheat, and explode. Creatures within 60 feet of the explosion must succeed at a DC 55 Reflex save or become covered in an alchemical slurry that transforms them into a horrifying amalgam of at least two of the creatures used to destroy the machine. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.111,r=0.904,b=0.249), with ID ff19812e-1171-4569-ac73-b243ec06e7d2 -->

The legendary blade Seritthial is said to have been forged by Iomedae, goddess of honor, justice, and valor. She is an intelligent +4 major striking holy bastard sword. Although the sword is made of steel, Seritthial is also treated as cold iron and silver (pages 253–254), allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or Seritthial can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. In addition, Strikes with Seritthial deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of Zon-Kuthon. While wielding Seritthial, against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon you gain the benefit of unfettered movement, a +4 status bonus to saves against death and void effects, void resistance 10, and suppress the doomed condition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.386,r=0.904,b=0.600), with ID 8d7e2150-d34a-452d-a8a3-e79fc457e5b6 -->

_Serithial_ was forged as a bastard sword, and she reverts
to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect
what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform
into it (choosing from dagger, shortsword, longsword, scimitar,
falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword) using an action,
which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically
tell _Serithial_ to transform at any time by using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait, after which _Serithial_ uses an
action to transform. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.602,r=0.904,b=0.738), with ID da98a913-943d-4551-a229-a0f921f92140 -->

Seritthial is willing to work with almost any partner as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long Seritthial attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.740,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID dcc3367c-ad09-4a89-821f-33925b5dde6e -->
