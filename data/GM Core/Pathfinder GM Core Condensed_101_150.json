These healing abilities can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast healing heals a number of hits each round\u2014usually one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on the Strike Damage table (page 120) and multiply that value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy to overcome\u2014and remember that most regeneration gets easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to decrease the creature\u2019s total HP by double its regeneration value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it can\u2019t prevent a creature\u2019s death and there isn\u2019t always a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.",

The scene is dark, eerie, and action-filled, evoking horror and supernatural themes.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 Main subject: Several undead creatures, with the most prominent being a decayed, bloodied zombie clawing its way out of the ground in the foreground.\n  \u2022 Setting: A graveyard at night, under a full moon, with leafless trees and a large, gothic-style church in the background.\n  \u2022 Perspective: Low-angle, close-up on the central zombie, with others rising from graves in the midground and background.\n  \u2022 Composition: The central zombie dominates the right foreground, reaching toward the viewer; other zombies are distributed across the scene, creating depth and a sense of encroaching threat.\n  \u2022 Lighting: Moonlight casts a cold, blue glow over the scene, with strong highlights and deep shadows; the zombies\u2019 eyes and wounds are accentuated with red, contrasting with the blue tones.\n  \u2022 Colour palette: Predominantly cool blues and greys, with vivid red for blood and glowing eyes.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar or measurement references.\n  \u2022 No on-image text except for the \"Pathfinder GM Core\" branding at the top.\n  \u2022 Artist signature \"FELIZ\" in the lower left corner.\n  \u2022 Stylised, painterly digital art style.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 Foreground: Central zombie emerging from a grave, reaching out with a bloodied hand.\n  \u2022 Midground: Several other zombies in various stages of emerging from graves, some partially obscured by tombstones and grass.\n  \u2022 Background: Gothic church, bare trees, and a large full moon, establishing the setting and mood.\n  \u2022 Rule-of-thirds: The main zombie\u2019s face and hand are positioned near the intersection points, drawing the viewer\u2019s focus.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The illustration conveys a sense of horror and imminent danger, with the undead appearing to rise en masse.\n  \u2022 The use of lighting and colour heightens the supernatural and menacing atmosphere.\n  \u2022 The composition leads the viewer\u2019s eye from the central figure outward, emphasising the scale of the undead threat and the isolation of the graveyard setting.\n  \u2022 The church in the background adds a gothic, possibly religious undertone, contrasting the sanctity of the place with the profane act of the dead rising.",
