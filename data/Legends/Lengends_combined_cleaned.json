Heroes must navigate relationships with a variety of people to further their quests, including smugglers, mages, scholars, artists, wealthy collectors, evangelists, and charlatans. From encounters with the people that populate their world, PCs can make friends, learn new skills, buy armor and weapons, gain information, and even enjoy a good meal. As adventurers become more powerful, authority figures might draw them into complex strategies and schemes or ask them to solve complicated problems. Heroes might spend only a single hour or a day with a given NPC, or they might form enduring friendships and relationships. So too might these characters become one-time enemies or even persistent antagonists; heroes might repeatedly encounter the same opponents, as the fortunes of war and the rise and fall of different nations and philosophies shape their world.",

In fact, she frequently changes her mind and has her former edicts erased from the books of Chelaxian history; overnight, even the direst decrees become outdated and are no longer enforced.

Abrogail, however, can enter into any number of Thrune contracts without restriction, and some believe she is even siphoning the other parties' investiture to increase her own. Once invested, Thrune contracts aren't visible—even though their effects can be—although anyone who has one is constantly aware of its presence.

We discovered a secondary pollinator, the crimson pharaoh beetle—Tukalo claimed that these beetles were the tastiest. I was not as excited about them on my plate as he was, but they kept us both fed in lean times.

They grew up in Kalabuto, though the exact details of their youth are unclear. Some claim to have seen them begging in the streets, left alone in the world. Others will swear they were the child of one of the secretaries to a councilor in Eleder, seeing firsthand what Chelaxian rule did to people who once spoke of the importance of their culture and history—how they threw it away so simply, and how corruption festered. Still others say they lived a relatively easy life in Freehold and only began to question their status and situation as Salgarth began to plot the \"restructuring\" of their home.

So Avarneus took up the role that was needed without anyone asking. They used their privileges, access, and guile to embed themself and other skilled spies in Sargava's colonial government. Key shipping routes and schedules, no matter how altered or convoluted, were disrupted and taken by pirates. The worst atrocities of cruel colonial rulers always seemed to end up presented to sympathetic eyes and hearts, who would then sever ties. Senior officials jumped at the offers of a Mwangi agent willing to sell out burgeoning rebellions, never assuming they might be sold out in turn. Slowly but surely, Sargava's elite reconsidered how tenuous their hold truly was due to the tireless and thankless work of Avarneus and others. When victory finally came, Avarneus was arrested as a perceived collaborator, but they took solace in the fact that their home would be in good hands. They were quietly surprised to see how many vouched for them in the fledgling Vidrian council's trials.",

Some say that Azarersi is the last surviving general of the Goblinblood Wars, while others insist she was the brutal Shriekwood Slayer who plundered Molthune's forests for a decade. Still other rumors claim she mastered a great god of the Darklands and chained it as her slave. Though these rumors are obviously embellished, there is a grain of truth to each. General Azarersi did fight in the Goblinblood Wars, she did raid Molthune for years, and a mighty barghest served her throughout the Ironfang Legion's campaigns. The greatest of the legends about her is the one that's entirely true: that she came from nowhere to achieve the impossible, carving out a homeland for goblinkind that shows every sign of enduring.",

One day, the girl hid from a blizzard in a valley, where she found a rowan tree next to a spring. The little girl was cold and tired, and she bathed in the spring... and the tree spoke to her. The rowan taught her secrets of birch and oak and ash, songs of wolves and stories of birds, and the wise tree taught her deep and ancient magic. When the little girl left the tree, she was no little girl, but a woman and a witch. \"The witch lived with many peoples, learning more of power and magic. But as her fame spread, more and more people came to ask her for help. Some tried to force her, but forcing a witch never works the way people think it does. Others begged her, and the witch hated the begging. Why, the witch thought, did all these people come to her with problems instead of solving them for themselves? \"So the witch started asking higher and higher prices from those who came to her. She asked for buckets of gold and threw them down the well. She asked for tracts of land and never visited them. She asked a man to cut off his ears to heal his blindness. She asked a farmer to burn his fields to save his cows. She asked for a child to cook her pet dog to give her parents wealth and glory. And people did all these things. The witch grew angrier and angrier with everyone's begging, until she grew a wrinkle for every question asked and a wart for every favor given.",

This is an ideal solution for Camilia, as the souls can either exist freely in Geb or pass onto their final judgment as they choose—and while Geb is a difficult ruler to reason with for both the living and the dead, his obsession with the archmage Nex and his lack of living spies to infiltrate his rival's nation has left him considering the offer.",

Except for his rare, unpredictable tours across Brevoy—tours that he used primarily to visit terrible retribution on wayward vassals, to remind them of the price of disloyalty—Choral rarely left his seat of power in New Stetven. Without Choral or his heirs to maintain unity, the nation of Brevoy has remained split at the seams. Old rivalries and new grudges have pushed the Issians and Rostlanders to the brink of civil war. Yet some few still fear this political infighting will only attract the return and wrath of House Rogarvia, and that those who fight for the right of rule will pay the price for presuming to lay claim to King Choral's crown.",

Eutropia's agents managed to resurrect her, Carrius stepped down, and Eutropia became grand princess; public opinion is that she faked her death. Their skepticism is unsurprising, given Eutropia seems to have weathered her own homicide without so much as a chipped nail or ruffled feather. Really, the agents even resurrected the dog that Rhien killed during the assassination (named Taldogis, on which I have no comment), so as to magically question the poor canine.

Geb scoured the globe for any power that would let him discover Nex's true fate, until he drove himself into despair with his own paranoia and finally took his own life. Yet even death could not deny Geb's vendetta; consumed by anguish and surrounded by necromancy, his suicide trapped his spirit on the Material Plane as a ghost. With no purpose and no escape, Geb languished on the throne of a kingdom he felt no affection for. Many of his subjects chose to follow Geb into undeath, leaving him with the rotting corpse of the nation he had founded. His only relief came in the form of tiny sparks of emotion across the ages, when it seemed something might challenge him. When the Holy Knights of Ozem attacked his kingdom, he retaliated by stealing the corpse of their god's deceased herald, Arazni, and turning her into his undead queen regent. When the armies of Holomog marched on Geb's borders, he unleashed a spell that turned every warrior to stone and rained down a cataclysm on their capital city. No matter how many potential rivals rose against him, none could withstand even his opening salvo. Each time he dashed a new foe, he sank deeper into despair, unmoved by opponents that lacked even a fraction of Nex's power.",

The same fate has fallen upon those who sought to keep oral histories of the previous ruler. That the blood mistresses have traditionally lived secretive lives has only made the mystery easier for Jakalyn to maintain.",

No records of the Red Mantis securing doses of the sun orchid elixir exist, for instance, nor is there any evidence of rituals performed to endow her with eternal life. Jakalyn herself often claims that the deaths of those she's slain keep her young, yet she's never revealed proof of this claim, and no other Red Mantis assassin has ever used such a technique.

The Blood Mistress explained to Abrogail that Kassi had already been targeted by the assassins years before on false pretenses. Misinformation had made it appear that Kassi had resurrected an earlier victim of the Red Mantis using an obscure occult ritual. However, Jakalyn learned that the victim had not perished; the assassin who had been sent on that job botched the murder and left the target unconscious but alive. Kassi's ministrations only saved the target from death rather than restoring them from death. As recompense, Jakalyn granted Kassi immunity to further Red Mantis assassinations as a show of good will. Abrogail did not let this setback delay her for long, ordering Kassi excruciated should the doctor ever set foot in Cheliax-controlled territory.",

In this way, she's found that it takes very little to push a group into doing her bidding, even in cases where the group itself would rather fight her instead. While payments of gold and magic are the typical rewards she offers for such missions, Jakalyn has been known to offer assassination services to those who please her. If murder's not to their liking, she can even offer adventurers clemencies—promises that no Red Mantis assassin will take a contract against a target or targets of the adventurers' choosing. These clemencies are almost always temporary injunctions, and in cases where Jakalyn secretly knows a target will be placed on the list soon, she arranges the length of these clemencies to her advantage. For those outside the Red Mantis's inner circle, Jakalyn has also been known to offer access to secret trainings or techniques normally reserved for the assassins themselves.",

After months went by with no one stepping forward to admit their association with the imprisoned messenger, Jakalyn discovered through her own investigation that the messenger hailed from Razmiran.

Kalabrynne survived the cataclysm, however, and though her heart surely ached at the loss, she rallied what survivors she could find and led their retreat to Vellumis. Once the survivors were safe in that port city, Kalabrynne called a meeting of all knights, soldiers, and able-bodied folk present there; in the days that followed, with many an impassioned speech and insightful plea, she organized the ragged survivors of a fallen nation into the proud and courageous Knights of Lastwall. The remains of Gwyndria were never recovered; either Iomeda r would be grateful beyond words for their recovery, for unconsecrated bones in the Gravelands rarely find peace.",

Unquestionably, she took the loss of her mother Gwyndria much harder than Kalabrynne, and every knight knows Clarethe's truest desire is to conquer the ruins of Vigil. It is most likely this quest that led to the fiery argument between her and her surviving mother, when Clarethe stormed from Vellumis with her most ardent allies in tow. This, then, was the schism among the knights that led to the formation of the Crimson Reclaimers. Since then the two Iomedars have made peace, and the two orders are one again; family and order each now more tightly bound than ever. Clarethe still prefers the field, though, for she is a creature of action.",

Then there was the craggy orc knight reclaimant with more scar than skin, who spoke enraptured of how Clarethe sings to her bastard sword in battle; how it chants the Crimson Oath in chorus with her; and how at times she seems to take its counsel and sends knights far afield to counter unforeseen enemy movements. Of these tales there is little proof; yet I say that a tale need not be factual to be true, especially in dark and hopeless times.",

The gods intentionally built mortals to be susceptible to addiction so we could be more easily deluded and addicted to religion and faith, and it is through that vulnerability that drugs prey upon us.\" Is this theological aside within a medical text truly necessary?",

Yet in Rahadoum, where faith in the gods is persecuted, techniques like those pioneered by Kassi are literal lifesavers. With degrees from major universities across Golarion and an apprenticeship with Artokus Kirran, the precocious Kassi Elaran traveled the world to further refine her techniques. Discoveries like kandleare, a deep sea algae with astounding medicinal properties, led to further breakthroughs, and studies with other medical practitioners helped her cultivate kandleare in her laboratories. She returned to Rahadoum to focus on her research, periodically sharing reports or updates with other scholars or government agencies for peer reviews and the like.",

By helping her to develop methods of healing based on science rather than faith, the veiled master posing as Hashim hopes to further erode the very concept of faith itself, something very different than what Kassi hopes to accomplish. Now that Kassi has an inkling of the veiled master's insidious schemes, whether or not its influence will play out the way it plans, only time will tell.

It has made me realize something: even all those years ago, I knew I couldn't simply stand by and research. But now I realize that traveling to triage the latest plague or disaster might be too reactive. And yet, I am needed for that! I realized I must foster students who can do what I am not able to accomplish alone. When we are young, we feel like we can not only do anything, but everything that needs to be done. Yet I can't be everywhere—I've tried. Even now, I feel an urge to travel to New Thassilon and seek out lost medicine. The people of the past brought forward with them, though I think I must prioritize treatment of some of the uniquely suffering victims of the Whispering Tyrant. Truly, positive energy can be as horrifying and cancerous as negative energy is ruinous, both bent so often as tools of the gods. Either way I go, I am doing nothing to prevent the next big medical emergency. But students... yes, students can be in two places at once, or more. Now I understand why you stayed in one place, hidden from all eyes. You knew that all along. I am sorry I accused you of caring only for Thuvia's economy, all those years ago. I hope you will forgive me for taking so long to learn that lesson. I write you for a more practical reason as well. While I know I spoke well of him in the past, I am beginning to detect something dangerous in Pastbroker ibn Sayid. Something more than mere greed. Something... wrong. when he calls in my favor, I think I am going to need to refuse it, and I am not sure what he'll do next.",

One year later, after conquering most of the neighboring lands, he was able to gain the willing alliance of several of Numeria's other clans. It took 3 more years to win the cautious acceptance of the remaining clans, who began to believe that Kevoth-Kul could be a truly great leader that would unite the land of Numeria. Declaring the mysterious city of Starfall to be his capital, Kevoth-Kul crowned himself Black Sovereign in 4690 AR.",

Chained skeletons, free-roaming exotic pets, and gruesome piles of skulls and other trophies mingle alongside luxurious baths, libraries, electric lights, and the highly advanced technological constructs known as gearsmen that serve as guards. The keep is usually in a state of constant revelry, with harried chefs providing meals and alcohol for feasts at all hours; demands for entertainment see a number of acrobats and storytellers present in the palace at all times, and guests have access to enough drug paraphernalia to put the finest Chelaxian parlors to shame. The recent influx of android residents and the Black Sovereign's newfound aversion to addictive substances has ushered in a more temperate atmosphere of late, though not by much.",

Rumor has it Barberstone Spa took the unusual step of completely draining and thoroughly scrubbing their big pool the other day as well, though they're being tight lipped about it, and I can't help but think that's related. Given the recent uptick in theft and vandalism in the area, as well as rumors of strange pirates attacking passersby, it seems likely they're still here. I suspect they're hiding out down in Underpeak, staring at that beautiful view of the Plane of Fire and plotting their next mischief. It's hard to know exactly what they're planning, but given their history it will probably involve the violent acquisition of something shiny, flammable, or both. It shouldn't be too hard to track them down, but be careful when you do; they're tougher than they look!",

He eventually grew desperate and infiltrated Madam Parisa's estate in an attempt to liberate Mariana. The attempt was an outright failure. Hamir faced off with Parisa's guards, and the fight culminating in a great fire in Madam Parisa's manor. From cellar to roof, the estate went up in flames, and neither Hamir nor Parisa were ever heard from again. Mariana was quickly captured and transferred to a new owner to continue her sentence.

Members hang these quilts from porches, windows, and clotheslines where tillers and other travelers can see them. Most quilts bear flowers, as they are inconspicuous and are instantly recognizable to other Bellflower agents. A common pattern is that of the lily. The flower warns of an upcoming crossroads, which may be heavily traveled. The background pattern's colors are used to indicate danger, with warmer colors suggesting higher risk.",

A traveler that recognizes the quilt can knock on the home's door, ask for directions to the \"Turning Theater\"—a reference to the halfling goddess Chaldira. Those in the know can then respond \"How would you perform?\" Responding with the phrase \"Why, with all my buttons!\" in halfling completes the exchange.

His pregnant and wounded mother, Ninnok (N female human hunter), fled as her fellow tribe members died, frantically running to secure a small piece of their future. Ninnok managed to survive giving birth in the desolate taiga, then carried her infant one desperate mile after another until she collapsed near Seer's Home, a settlement serving as home to the elders of all Varki tribes. Ninnok was cared for by the elders, though the trauma and tragedy she had endured left her quiet and withdrawn. Nankou grew up raised on the collected stories, knowledge, and wisdom of all the Varki tribes while learning to hunt and fish to provide for his mother.",

His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex—a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power—and in rumored immortality. None alive can say if agelessness alone was enough for Nex to achieve his destiny, but his legacy has led countless adventurers into the Crux to build their own legend.",

    "text": "Soon thereafter, Nex laid his eyes upon the gem beyond compare: the city of Absalom. Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom's skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city's gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein. Serving as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex's horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society's Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard's ambition.",

The archwizard could be brash, and his pursuit of arcane secrets often put him at odds with beings strange and mighty. The Zenj epic Song of the Fallen Briar recounts an early adventure in which the ambitious wizard sought sky-fallen relics among the toppled temples and shattered towers of the Mwangi Expanse. According to the Song, the young wizard earned the first of his great enemies in the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, after Nex and his companions thwarted one of the powerful fey demigod's plans. The Eldest and the wizard-king would clash many times after that first encounter, most notably when Nex \"borrowed\" a bandersnatch to relieve a pirate siege on Quantium. Curiously, after Nex sought to invade Absalom with a horde drawn from other planes—most prominently the shadowy fey horrors Count Ranalc was known to master—the Exiled Eldest vanished from the historical record.",

The two archwizards blurred national lines with alarming frequency, each seeking to expand their reach at the expense of the other.

From plagues that ossified hapless farmers to crawling behemoths the rival of any dragon, the devastating powers unleashed created a blighted no-man's land between the two nations, called the Mana Wastes. As thousands perished, the wizard-kings artificially extended their lives through obscure and perilous sorceries, creating a cold war that would span generations, ending suddenly when a Gebbite attack wreathed the city of Quantium in poisonous fumes. Though the attack cost countless lives, Nex was able to retreat to his personal demiplane, the Refuge of Nex, while the city rallied a defense, only for the wizard to vanish entirely from Golarion. Geb, haunted by an enemy truly beyond his reach for decades, finally ended his life a full 60 years later. Nex has yet to emerge from the Refuge, but his legend still looms over Garund.",

Yet Queen Telandia Edasseril's policy of allowing fleeing citizens of Razmiran into Kyonin, so long as they aren't Razmir's priests, has recently resulted in turmoil along the two nations' shared borders. In addition to refugees being attacked by cultists intent upon showing defectors the error of their ways, Queen Telandia suspects that Razmir may have sent infiltrators to weaken Kyonin for some unknown purpose—or simply out of spite.",

Freed from his prison under Gallowspire, Tar-Baphon is now rebuilding his fortress on the Isle of Terror, making his return an existential threat to all those who border Lake Encarthan. Not long after the Tyrant's return, Razmir sent a herald to the Isle with an offer of nonaggression. The herald returned, now a wraith wearing the mask of Razmir's faith, accepting the offer with one condition: Razmiran would tithe its dead to the Tyrant, at least 1,000 bodies per month, to maintain the peace. No one knows if the Living God accepted these terms, but as of yet there has been no fighting between the two. The Pale Mask, as the herald has come to be known, still resides in Thronestep and can be found wandering the city at night. Yet Blood Mistress Jakalyn of the Red Mantis Assassins recently announced that someone had paid for a contract to be placed on Tar-Baphon, and discovered that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. It's uncertain whether the missive was from Razmir himself, an acolyte who overstepped, or an enemy hoping to gain Razmir the wrong sort of attention, and just as uncertain is what might result from a clash between any of these three powers.",

Before the sudden and brutal crackdown on dissidents against House Thrune, Vyvienne had been intensely focused on her career as an actor and singer in Kintargo's robust theater scene, hoping to achieve something like the fame of her favorite opera star, Shensen (CG female half-elf celebrity)—and hoping to keep her tiefling heritage forever concealed. She had been fortunate in both respects, steadily landing roles and easily using her magical powers to disguise the orange-tinged fur and yellow eyes that she owed to a rakshasa progenitor. She had left the slums of northern Westcrown behind for this opportunity, making the arduous journey to Kintargo with only her sister—they had left home after the death of their parents, who were slaughtered along with the other members of the Bastards of Erebus tiefling gang. Vyvienne was thus no stranger to violence and loss. But as dawn rose following that particularly blood-soaked night in Kintargo, as the flames still sputtered and the cries rose over Shensen's disappearance, Vyvienne felt the smoldering hate that she harbored for House Thrune burst into insatiable flames.",

Sihar did, and since then Sewell has been completely dedicated to Sihar and her mission. Sihar relies on Sewell and trusts her above anyone else, even if Sewell is far quicker to jump to violence than the more prudent Sihar.",

He has escaped from his prison at Gallowspire, where he was once locked in by the *Great Seal*—the name of his prison only flared his ambitious fervor and arrogance when he destroyed it with his magical superweapon, the *Radiant Fire*. Imprisonment on his own throne did not temper his hubris or his ego—it only gave him more time to plot his escape and his plans beyond.

She has a steely gaze and a serious demeanor and has been described as looking more like a painting brought to life than a real person. The queen wears the traditional symbol of the Kyonin monarchy, the Viridian Crown: an enchanted circlet made of vines and flowers that change with the seasons. She has scarcely a hair out of place, though occasionally light talon marks grace her skin, a sign of the queen's one passion aside from the throne.

    "text": "# A ROYAL MATCH Telandia has always willingly sacrificed her personal wants for the good of her subjects, and this remains true for her relationships as well. While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced—good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn't factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are",

This rush of freedom has made Tessa somewhat reckless, and while that recklessness allows bold successes like Tessa's recent raid on Cheliax, it has left more cautious pirates worried about the inevitable backlash. Some of the other pirate lords regard Tessa as a weak and irresponsible leader, someone unworthy of representing and guiding them. Others simply covet her position or are actively scheming against her in order to open the way for a Chelaxian invasion. For now, however, Tessa is too popular to challenge, and she's very skilled at finding ways to increase that popularity.",

She closed the scroll she was reading and looked up at her father, standing by the window and looking at the horizon as if he could see Valenhall already. \"Then...\" she started, but paused. She knew her father well enough. If he had spoken it, then his mind was set. \"Then I wish you safe travels,\" she said instead. She stood up, grabbing her book and her sword. \"Are you certain of your choice still?\" he asked as Thira reached the door. \"You think my brothers more capable?\" she asked. \"You know I don't,\" he said, turning to face her. \"I only question your choice of prey. The message you will send.\" Thira stood by the door and looked at him. She could see worry in his eyes, though he wasn't looking at her. He was looking past her. \"Do you remember my duel with Josvein all those years ago?\" Thira spoke. \"Over his mockery when we returned from some hunt?\" The hint of a fond smile appeared on her father's face. \"I do not remember the hunt itself anymore,\" Thira continued. \"What I do remember is how soundly I thrashed that boy, and how it didn't matter. I was called a cheater for fighting smarter, since I knew I was not as strong. A cheater for using every advantage I had.\" Sveinn shook his head and looked back out the window. \"I paid attention after that. I kept my ears open. I understood. Not only was I raised in the shadows of your heroics and grand accomplishments, but I was also never the tallest and strongest child. Whoever thought of me did not think of Thira Ash-Eyes. They thought of a traitor and a witch. They thought of Sveinn Blood-Eagle's weakling daughter.\" \"You are no weakling,\" Sveinn said. \"No traitor. And no witch.\" \"What I am doesn't matter. When our own people, the so-called friends I grew up with think of me that way, what chance is there that another linnorm king will ever respect me?\" Sveinn let the silence stay for a few moments. \"I worked hard to earn our lands the respect they deserve,\" he finally said. \"And I will make sure that respect isn't lost,\" Thira replied. \"I will be climbing uphill in a blizzard, but I promise I have thought about every step. We will need a strong and sturdy image when you leave, even if it has to be unfriendly at first.\" With that, Sveinn nodded with a deep sigh, and Thira left the room. She gathered her traveling gear and was quietly out of Kalsgard before the light of dawn. ## CHALLENGE Thira walked through the snow in the manner the Varki ranger had shown her when she had shared a meal and a span of time with him at his camp. He was Nankou, he had said, and he had slain his own linnorm to lay claim to the throne of Icemark. She had not heard of his victory, she said, but would take word of it to the Thanelands and from there let it spread beyond. She said nothing of his heritage, and what the Ulfen people might think of Nankou taking the title. He said nothing of her father. Thira liked him for that. She had spent a good amount of time researching her plans, focusing on the king whom other kings scouted for, White Estrid. While learning about",

In Cheliax, investigating the misdeeds of the powerful often ends poorly for the investigator, but Lictor Vidoc's deft political maneuvering and the long list of nobles who owe him personal favors have given the Scourge Hellknights a relatively free hand to pursue their duties.

But a group of humble goblins convinced Ulthun to stand down, begging for his help to save their tribe from the undead. Recognizing the goblins would die without someone to help them flee to safety and knowing that many knights would be too clouded by prejudice to offer assistance, the encounter reminded Ulthun that his greater duty was to his suffering people—no matter what form they took. Ulthun fled his collapsing nation with the goblins and his remaining knights at his side, vowing to one day return, bring an end to Tar-Baphon, and rebuild his home.",

Each column represents an island in her domain, the Ironbound Islands. Her royal regalia is cropped at the arms, revealing pale white skin and toned muscle. A powerful woman with white hair and pale blue eyes from her albinism, Estrid wears ornately decorated armor that covers her body thoroughly to protect her from the sunlight. Even her royal trappings are fashioned from thick leather, as she is perpetually ready to do battle. Her battle axe is always at her side, the hilt hewn from the dark rock of the Ironbound Islands. Banners around her hall depict sea creatures locked in combat with armored women. Claw motifs adorn her throne, as if when she presides over the hall, she does so from the fallen body of a great beast. This is the Linnorm King White Estrid, scoffed at by other Ulfen in her land, yet so far unchallenged in her rule.",

Boiltongue remains bitter at times about the trade of his self-determination for his life, but he also acknowledges that Estrid gained a potent strategic advantage in choosing to not strike him down. The linnorm exists in a balancing act of resentment and respect that can easily swing in either direction depending on the situation and Boiltongue's mood, but as the years have gone on and he has accepted his fate, the pendulum tends toward respect. He is a great ally to the city of Halgrim, as well as the Ironbound Islands, and roams it as a protector, a duty he even seems to enjoy providing.

It is well earned, and my only regret is that Rothos suffered so terribly at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant to create the vacancy you now occupy. He was a good soldier and an even better commander. His reports are certainly much better organized and insightful than mine ever were, so your time reading them will be time well spent.",

There is already a lot of ink spilled about the heroics of the Pathfinder Society, the power of the city's mages leaping to its defense, and the siege weapons you designed and built (and, frankly, cosseted!) in your former role as First Siege Gear. All these helped break the siege, but all of them would have failed if we didn't have the former slaves doing the backbreaking work of defense. They were doing it for themselves, for their own city, and not out of fear of a master's lash. That made all the difference, I believe. The proudest I have ever been of the Grand Council was when they declared slavery and the slave trade illegal throughout Absalom only a few weeks after my order of manumission.

Wynsal was then declared acting primarch until an official replacement for the position could be found. While Wynsal is happy to cede his position to a legitimately chosen successor, his impeccable character and effective governance have led many to voice their support for Wynsal being appointed to the primarchy in truth. This popularity, especially among Wynsal's former underlings in Absalom's military forces, has caused other political hopefuls to see Wynsal as a threat to their ambitions, and rumors have been spread by the nobility that Wynsal is intending a military coup.

Qadira is forever surrounded by threats, forever far from imperial aid, and forever waiting for Taldor to resume its millennia-long habit of conquering its neighbors. Despite the comfort of his upbringing in the Qahir Palace of Katheer, Xerystes never lost sight of the fact that life on the frontier meant danger.",

I know only vague rumors of the practice have reached the capital, but I cannot walk through the Grand Souk without seeing an efreeti bound in iron chains or some conjurer with his \"pet\" marid. Many of the nobles and merchants here keep human or halfling slaves, and slave markets operate openly in the city! It makes my blood boil. I have freed all of the palace slaves and established salaries for them, but there is much more to do. In fact, I must cut this letter short to meet with an advisor and one of the palace wizards. All of my best to you and your mother. Write me soon, Deena",

Those lucky enough to earn an audience with her speak of her frank nature and calm self-assurance. An athletic woman with warm bronze skin and copper highlights in her dark hair, al-Parishat's appearance marks her origins in central Kelesh, and, indeed, she is a recent immigrant to Qadira, having traveled from the capital of the Padishah Empire for an arranged marriage with Satrap Xerystes II. The people of Qadira have generally welcomed the newcomer, hoping that the long-awaited end to Xerystes's bachelorhood will settle questions of succession in the satrapy.",

When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion. The genies and their elemental traits are as follows: djinni (air), efreeti (fire), marid (water), or shaitan (earth). A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie's elemental trait. Genie-touched companions can choose from the following options when they become specialized animal companions.",
