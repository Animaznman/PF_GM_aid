But it is also populated by people, from the rulers of empires to the rebels that work to bring down their regimes, and everything in between. Heroes must navigate relationships with a variety of people to further their quests, including smugglers, mages, scholars, artists, wealthy collectors, evangelists, and charlatans. From encounters with the people that populate their world, PCs can make friends, learn new skills, buy armor and weapons, gain information, and even enjoy a good meal. As adventurers become more powerful, authority figures might draw them into complex strategies and schemes or ask them to solve complicated problems. Heroes might spend only a single hour or a day with a given NPC, or they might form enduring friendships and relationships. So too might these characters become one-time enemies or even persistent antagonists; heroes might repeatedly encounter the same opponents, as the fortunes of war and the rise and fall of different nations and philosophies shape their world.",

Keenly aware of her reputation as being immature, capricious, and demanding, Abrogail cleverly uses this image to keep those who underestimate her off-balance. Yet she controls the fractious noble houses and byzantine bureaucracy of Cheliax predominantly through fear. Against those who offend her personally, her favorite punishment is petrification—an eternity in stone under her watchful eye in the Imperial Palace. These ornamental traitors further serve to remind every visitor, courtier, slave, and fiend of the majestrix's supreme authority.\n\nfigure: A hand holding a golden, ornate sword with a crossguard shaped like bat wings. The sword is positioned vertically, and the hand is visible from the left side of the image. The figure is placed to the left of the text, partially overlapping the first few lines.",

As a result, Andira grew up a happy child without wants or complaints. As a gift for her fifteenth birthday, Andira's parents paid for a voyage to Niswan in Jalmeray. A set of slaver galleys ambushed Andira's ship during her return journey, and she soon found herself the latest in a group of slaves serving as rowers. After several months Andira lost all hope of ever returning home, until a fleet of Gray Corsair ships found the trio of galleys and liberated Andira in the process. Among the Gray Corsairs was a woman named **Andira Galimnos** (LG female human Gray Corsair); the young Andira believed the fact that two shared a name to be more than mere coincidence. During the voyage home, Andira made it her goal to join the Eagle Knights to help others, much like Andira Galimnos had helped her.",

Despite welcome overtures from the neighboring Grand Princess Eutropia, Andira finds that the relationship that the Andoran people have with Taldor is still strained, as Eutropia's father, Grand Prince Stavian III, still considered Andoran part of the Taldan Empire, despite being either unable or unwilling to enforce the claim.",

They grew up in Kalabuto, though the exact details of their youth are unclear. Some claim to have seen them begging in the streets, left alone in the world. Others will swear they were the child of one of the secretaries to a councilor in Eleder, seeing firsthand what Chelaxian rule did to people who once spoke of the importance of their culture and history—how they threw it away so simply, and how corruption festered. Still others say they lived a relatively easy life in Freehold and only began to question their status and situation as Salgarth began to plot the \"restructuring\" of their home. Some whisper Avarneus has the standoffish, overly quiet inconspicuousness of someone from the hive of criminals and ne'er-do-wells of Crown's End.",

However, it quickly became apparent that many things they seemed to have such easy access to were almost entirely closed off from those who shared their idealistic vision, as information and the trust needed to gain it were in short supply for natives of what would soon be Vidrian. So Avarneus took up the role that was needed without anyone asking. They used their privileges, access, and guile to embed themself and other skilled spies in Sargava's colonial government. Key shipping routes and schedules, no matter how altered or convoluted, were disrupted and taken by pirates. The worst atrocities of cruel colonial rulers always seemed to end up presented to sympathetic eyes and hearts, who would then sever ties. Senior officials jumped at the offers of a Mwangi agent willing to sell out burgeoning rebellions, never assuming they might be sold out in turn. Slowly but surely, Sargava's elite reconsidered how tenuous their hold truly was due to the tireless and thankless work of Avarneus and others. When victory finally came, Avarneus was arrested as a perceived collaborator, but they took solace in the fact that their home would be in good hands. They were quietly surprised to see how many vouched for them in the fledgling Vidrian council's trials.",

Some say that Azarersi is the last surviving general of the Goblinblood Wars, while others insist she was the brutal Shriekwood Slayer who plundered Molthune's forests for a decade. Still other rumors claim she mastered a great god of the Darklands and chained it as her slave. Though these rumors are obviously embellished, there is a grain of truth to each. General Azarersi did fight in the Goblinblood Wars, she did raid Molthune for years, and a mighty barghest served her throughout the Ironfang Legion's campaigns. The greatest of the legends about her is the one that's entirely true: that she came from nowhere to achieve the impossible, carving out a homeland for goblinkind that shows every sign of enduring.",

Cheliax's reputation for treachery has made her wary, but she respects Queen Abrogail's ruthlessness and believes the empire may be a suitable ally for her goals. Meanwhile, Druma and Qadira seem like promising trade partners who might value Oprak's access to new markets through the Stone Roads. The venture currently holding much of Azaersi's interest is that of two hobgoblin alchemists who acquired the general's leave to seek training at the Citadel of the Alchemist in Thuvia. That Artokus Kirran apparently accepted the two hobgoblins as students surprised Azaersi and has earned her complete, precise attention.",

One day, the girl hid from a blizzard in a valley, where she found a rowan tree next to a spring. The little girl was cold and tired, and she bathed in the spring... and the tree spoke to her. The rowan taught her secrets of birch and oak and ash, songs of wolves and stories of birds, and the wise tree taught her deep and ancient magic. When the little girl left the tree, she was no little girl, but a woman and a witch.\n\n\"The witch lived with many peoples, learning more of power and magic. But as her fame spread, more and more people came to ask her for help. Some tried to force her, but forcing a witch never works the way people think it does. Others begged her, and the witch hated the begging. Why, the witch thought, did all these people come to her with problems instead of solving them for themselves?\n\n\"So the witch started asking higher and higher prices from those who came to her. She asked for buckets of gold and threw them down the well. She asked for tracts of land and never visited them. She asked a man to cut off his ears to heal his blindness. She asked a farmer to burn his fields to save his cows. She asked for a child to cook her pet dog to give her parents wealth and glory. And people did all these things. The witch grew angrier and angrier with everyone's begging, until she grew a wrinkle for every question asked and a wart for every favor given.",

Though few know the truth, recently her daughter, Queen Elvanna, trapped Baba Yaga in a set of matryoshka dolls. After being released by local heroes, Baba Yaga is willing to consider that perhaps she'd been too dismissive of this world.",

The central action involves a figure gesturing dramatically toward a seated, ice-encased woman, while three other figures and a fox observe.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The scene is set in a grand hall with arched windows revealing a mountainous landscape in the background.\n  • Five main characters are present: three standing on the left in elaborate, fur-lined and armored clothing; one central figure with long white hair and a flowing robe gesturing forcefully; and a woman seated on an icy throne or pedestal, surrounded by shards of ice.\n  • The border is highly decorative, featuring Celtic knotwork, icy motifs, and stylized figures and symbols, including a skull with antlers at the top center and two purple mushroom-like creatures.\n  • The color palette is dominated by cool blues, purples, and icy whites, with contrasting warm reds and golds in the clothing.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.\n  • The illustration is highly stylized, with a medieval manuscript or tapestry aesthetic.\n  • No on-image text or UI elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The three standing figures and a fox are positioned to the left, facing the central action.\n  • The central figure with white hair is in a dynamic pose, reaching toward the seated woman on the right, who is encased in ice.\n  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the dramatic gesture and the ice-encased woman as focal points.\n  • The ornate border frames the scene, adding narrative and thematic context.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration conveys a moment of confrontation or magical action, with the central figure possibly casting a spell or issuing a command toward the ice-encased woman.\n  • The presence of the fox and the varied attire of the characters suggest a party of adventurers or a council.\n  • The icy motifs and the throne imply themes of winter, magic, or imprisonment.\n  • The border elements reinforce the fantasy and magical setting, adding layers of symbolism and narrative depth.",

As king, Choral was a remote and terrifying figure, little seen by his people and less loved. Except for his rare, unpredictable tours across Brevoy—tours that he used primarily to visit terrible retribution on wayward vassals, to remind them of the price of disloyalty—Choral rarely left his seat of power in New Stetven.  \n  Without Choral or his heirs to maintain unity, the nation of Brevoy has remained split at the seams. Old rivalries and new grudges have pushed the Issians and Rostlanders to the brink of civil war. Yet some few still fear this political infighting will only attract the return and wrath of House Rogarvia, and that those who fight for the right of rule will pay the price for presuming to lay claim to King Choral's crown.",

Two key points, however. First, some bizarre minor cult managed to resurrect the late Carrius II. Then, toward the end of the crisis, our coreligionist Rhien secretly murdered Eutropia on the orders of some secret society or other, which led to Carrius II briefly ruling Taldor. Eutropia's agents managed to resurrect her, Carrius stepped down, and Eutropia became grand princess; public opinion is that she faked her death. Their skepticism is unsurprising, given Eutropia seems to have weathered her own homicide without so much as a chipped nail or ruffled feather. Really, the agents even resurrected the dog that Rhien killed during the assassination (named Taldogis, on which I have no comment), so as to magically question the poor canine. I am gravely disappointed in the quality of assassination in this country.\n\nNo one stays dead.",

In the aftermath, there was no sign of Geb's rival archmage, who had escaped into a magical refuge only to vanish from Golarion entirely. While history claimed this as Geb's victory, it rang hollow to the necromancer, who believed Nex had not only survived his final attack but was merely biding his time until the chance came to retaliate. Geb scoured the globe for any power that would let him discover Nex's true fate, until he drove himself into despair with his own paranoia and finally took his own life. Yet even death could not deny Geb's vendetta; consumed by anguish and surrounded by necromancy, his suicide trapped his spirit on the Material Plane as a ghost.\n\nWith no purpose and no escape, Geb languished on the throne of a kingdom he felt no affection for. Many of his subjects chose to follow Geb into undeath, leaving him with the rotting corpse of the nation he had founded. His only relief came in the form of tiny sparks of emotion across the ages, when it seemed something might challenge him. When the Holy Knights of Ozem attacked his kingdom, he retaliated by stealing the corpse of their god's deceased herald, Arazni, and turning her into his undead queen regent. When the armies of Holomog marched on Geb's borders, he unleashed a spell that turned every warrior to stone and rained down a cataclysm on their capital city. No matter how many potential rivals rose against him, none could withstand even his opening salvo. Each time he dashed a new foe, he sank deeper into despair, unmoved by opponents that lacked even a fraction of Nex's power.",

This consistent abuse took its toll on the artifact, and the tapestry, already in decline due to Hao Jin's absence, rapidly began to unravel. Through the sacrifices of dozens of Pathfinder agents and former Master of Spells Aram Zey, the Pathfinder Society staved off the tapestry's destruction long enough to find Hao Jin, exonerate her in the eyes of Axis and the Boneyard, and recruit her help in returning the tapestry's inhabitants to Tian Xia. This effort bore fruit despite an assault by the hag Aslynn (NE female night hag merchant), but the tapestry itself ripped further in the process, scattering many of its contents across the Astral Plane.",

When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful DC 35 Athletics check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain plane shifts you to Heaven when you reach the summit. You can return the mountain to the sky into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.",

Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-level create demiplane ritual (Advanced Player's Guide 241). When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.",

Beyond the fact that the blade is made from a skymetal alloy, its properties remain a mystery. Magical attempts to identify the blade produce varying results. At times, the blade seems capable of channeling electricity, while other times it instead burns like a flame. To the best of the Mendevian mages' understanding, the blade's properties change with every attempt to identify them. There is some consistency in the observations, however. Striking the blade always causes it to hum with a pleasant tone for several seconds, reminiscent of a tuning fork. Additionally, every person to study the blade notes a single ability that is always present across their unique identifications. Irahai's personal diviner, for example, always identifies the blade's ability to banish conjured creatures, but its other properties always vary.",

The messenger claimed that Tar-Baphon was no legitimate ruler, and argued that the Tyrant was a power-hungry fool attempting to become a god, a clear offense to Achaekek and the Red Mantis. When Jakalyn grew frustrated at the patron's attempts to remain anonymous, she had the messenger imprisoned and announced the request and incarceration publicly. After months went by with no one stepping forward to admit their association with the imprisoned messenger, Jakalyn discovered through her own investigation that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. Whispers that Jakalyn may be considering a retaliatory assassination against Razmir himself have begun to spread, as have rumors that she's still considering taking the contract on Tar-Baphon. Both Razmir and Tar-Baphon's power are great enough to combat most threats, but the attention of one of the world's most dangerous killers is something that neither lich nor \"god\" would be wise to ignore.",

I armed her with as much knowledge as I could, informing her that some of the bravest of the Emerald Boughs had already chosen to live secretly among the people of Mzali and see what they might learn. Sihar has since told me that a number of these Emerald Boughs have drawn too much attention to themselves. She is unable to do much to aid them, with her Bright Lions being stretched thin as is, but she told me she's willing to assist as much as she can with any efforts to smuggle my people out of the city. The Emerald Boughs are community organizers, not warriors. I fear for them if Walkena's ire falls upon them before they can be rescued.",

Now that Tar-Baphon has escaped and returned to power, all must band together to defeat him—not as servants and masters, but as comrades united with glorious purpose. Yet there are two who stand tall among the knights. I will not call these two our leaders; but they are an inspiration to all those who hold the banner of Lastwall high.",

Yet in Rahadoum, where faith in the gods is persecuted, techniques like those pioneered by Kassi are literal lifesavers. With degrees from major universities across Golarion and an apprenticeship with Artokus Kirran, the precocious Kassi Elaran traveled the world to further refine her techniques. Discoveries like kandleare, a deep sea algae with astounding medicinal properties, led to further breakthroughs, and studies with other medical practitioners helped her cultivate kandleare in her laboratories. She returned to Rahadoum to focus on her research, periodically sharing reports or updates with other scholars or government agencies for peer reviews and the like.",

She was introduced to the substance by Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid via a series of missives, but only recently has she started to suspect that his motives might be sinister. By helping her to develop methods of healing based on science rather than faith, the veiled master posing as Hashim hopes to further erode the very concept of faith itself, something very different than what Kassi hopes to accomplish. Now that Kassi has an inkling of the veiled master's insidious schemes, whether or not its influence will play out the way it plans, only time will tell. Regardless, none can argue that what Kassi has accomplished has been anything but beneficial to her patients and the medical community at large.",

One year later, after conquering most of the neighboring lands, he was able to gain the willing alliance of several of Numeria's other clans. It took 3 more years to win the cautious acceptance of the remaining clans, who began to believe that Kevoth-Kul could be a truly great leader that would unite the land of Numeria. Declaring the mysterious city of Starfall to be his capital, Kevoth-Kul crowned himself Black Sovereign in 4690 AR.",

The palace interior contains a vibrant environment that leaps between the crude and the cosmopolitan in a way that is jarring to many visitors. Chained skeletons, free-roaming exotic pets, and gruesome piles of skulls and other trophies mingle alongside luxurious baths, libraries, electric lights, and the highly advanced technological constructs known as gearsmen that serve as guards. The keep is usually in a state of constant revelry, with harried chefs providing meals and alcohol for feasts at all hours; demands for entertainment see a number of acrobats and storytellers present in the palace at all times, and guests have access to enough drug paraphernalia to put the finest Chelaxian parlors to shame. The recent influx of android residents and the Black Sovereign's newfound aversion to addictive substances has ushered in a more temperate atmosphere of late, though not by much.",

Similarly, he only communicates with her in writing to set up meetings, and any writing they exchange is coded. Whenever Gawta confronts him on his paranoia, Crookchar points to the Blue Streaks being named after them both as indication of how highly he regards her.

The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain. Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground.",

These quilts bear specific designs to notify Bellflower tillers and those they guide of any important information. Members hang these quilts from porches, windows, and clotheslines where tillers and other travelers can see them. Most quilts bear flowers, as they are inconspicuous and are instantly recognizable to other Bellflower agents. A common pattern is that of the lily. The flower warns of an upcoming crossroads, which may be heavily traveled. The background pattern's colors are used to indicate danger, with warmer colors suggesting higher risk.",

A traveler that recognizes the quilt can knock on the home's door, ask for directions to the \"Turning Theater\"—a reference to the halfling goddess Chaldira. Those in the know can then respond \"How would you perform?\" Responding with the phrase \"Why, with all my buttons!\" in halfling completes the exchange.

His tribe was slaughtered by one of the fearsome draconic creatures known as a linnorm on the day of his birth. His pregnant and wounded mother, Ninnok (N female human hunter), fled as her fellow tribe members died, frantically running to secure a small piece of their future. Ninnok managed to survive giving birth in the desolate taiga, then carried her infant one desperate mile after another until she collapsed near Seer's Home, a settlement serving as home to the elders of all Varki tribes. Ninnok was cared for by the elders, though the trauma and tragedy she had endured left her quiet and withdrawn. Nankou grew up raised on the collected stories, knowledge, and wisdom of all the Varki tribes while learning to hunt and fish to provide for his mother.",

Though clearly a legend who shaped the arcane and political landscape of Garund for nearly five millennia, Nex is a controversial figure in the modern day. At once a peerless scholar and a fierce war master, the archwizard's artifice stands in stark contrast to his centuries-long rivalry with the necromancer Geb. The clash between the two would lead to the loss of countless lives, the ravaging of both lands, the disappearance of Nex himself, and Geb's transformation to ghostly tyrant. Long absent from the kingdom bearing his name, Nex lives on in much the same way as Geb—an uneasy rumor haunting a tenuously peaceful realm.",

Guided by insights snatched from the Great Beyond, the ambitious wizard sought to craft a mighty destiny for himself. To that end, Nex searched for power and wisdom in the ruins of civilizations long past. In his research, he sought out cryptic bas-reliefs in the Mwangi Expanse, ley lines beneath Quantium, and scrying pools in the cyclopean depths of cursed Gholanoth. His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex—a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power—and in rumored immortality. None alive can say if agelessness alone was enough for Nex to achieve his destiny, but his legacy has led countless adventurers into the Crux to build their own legend.",

Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom's skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city's gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein.\n\nServing as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex's horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society's Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard's ambition.",

The archwizard could be brash, and his pursuit of arcane secrets often put him at odds with beings strange and mighty.

According to the Song, the young wizard earned the first of his great enemies in the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, after Nex and his companions thwarted one of the powerful fey demigod's plans. The Eldest and the wizard-king would clash many times after that first encounter, most notably when Nex \"borrowed\" a bandersnatch to relieve a pirate siege on Quantium. Curiously, after Nex sought to invade Absalom with a horde drawn from other planes—most prominently the shadowy fey horrors Count Ranalc was known to master—the Exiled Eldest vanished from the historical record.",

In the years since, Razmir has attracted an influential cult of followers. Lured to him with the promise of prosperity and peace, converts more often than not find themselves struggling to survive in a nation that seems built to funnel wealth and privilege to the priests.

In fact, scholars who have attempted to collect a complete\ntale of the Living God's mortal days find the history filled with\nconflicting events and differing origins. Some stories, for\nexample, claim that he grew up in Taldor, penniless on the\nstreets of Oppara, begging for food and sleeping under a\nsewer grate; others purport that he was raised in Varisia on a\nsmall rural farm, destined to live a simple life until he uncovered\nthe secret library of the Runelords, learning to wield their mighty\npower all on his own. Despite their differences, all of these stories\nbear a few basic similarities. In each, Razmir came from humble\nbeginnings, neither wealthy nor powerful, but through his own\ncunning and daring, he rose to become a deity.",

Razmir offered\nprosperity and peace to Duke Melcat if only he would convert to the\nfaith.

His army was made up entirely from converts—they were far from professional warriors, but with the personal backing of Razmir, they were rarely challenged. It was only upon reaching Ustalav that this expansion slowed. Razmir's attempts to annex further River Kingdoms have proven fruitless. That has not stopped him from trying, although he now employs subtler methods. The faithful of Razmir travel far and wide to spread the gospel. When arriving in a community, they immediately take up with the poor and indigent, offering them food, aid, and succor, all the while telling these desperate souls about the glory that is Razmir. With the new believers behind them, they then petition to open up a shrine and pressure local businesses to offer up donations to the church to protect and improve the neighborhood. If left unchecked, they soon infiltrate the local militia and then the government, using masks to hide the true identities of the faithful.",

The Pale Mask, as the herald has come to be known, still resides in Thronestep and can be found wandering the city at night.

She had left the slums of northern Westcrown behind for this opportunity, making the arduous journey to Kintargo with only her sister—they had left home after the death of their parents, who were slaughtered along with the other members of the Bastards of Erebus tiefling gang. Vyvienne was thus no stranger to violence and loss. But as dawn rose following that particularly blood-soaked night in Kintargo, as the flames still sputtered and the cries rose over Shensen's disappearance, Vyvienne felt the smoldering hate that she harbored for House Thrune burst into insatiable flames.",

Already adept at disguise, Vyvienne further learned its value as she crafted an alter ego, a new hero named the Sapphire Butterfly.\n\tIn the guise of the Butterfly, she could act swiftly and directly against Thrune agents and raise the morale of the oppressed; as Vyvienne, she could sneak into a party hosted by local nobility and learn Thrune's secrets. She could also show her true heritage as the Butterfly, serving as a symbol to all the people of Cheliax of the power, intelligence, and beauty of tieflings.",

The elven mage rules over her subjects with grace and skill, keeping the nation of Kyonin united despite its citizens' dislike of anything resembling authoritarian commands. She has a steely gaze and a serious demeanor and has been described as looking more like a painting brought to life than a real person. The queen wears the traditional symbol of the Kyonin monarchy, the Viridian Crown: an enchanted circlet made of vines and flowers that change with the seasons. She has scarcely a hair out of place, though occasionally light talon marks grace her skin, a sign of the queen's one passion aside from the throne. She is not only a skilled falconer, but magically assumes falcon form herself, flying alongside her beloved bird, Nyranin.",

    "text": "# A ROYAL MATCH\nTelandia has always willingly sacrificed her personal wants for the good of her subjects, and this remains true for her relationships as well. While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced—good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn't factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are",

While the queen is naturally disinclined to open any discussions with Razmir, she does allow Razmirans to enter Kyonin through their shared border, so long as they are not Razmiran priests. Recently, turmoil along the Razmiran–Kyonin border has Queen Telandia suspicious that Razmiran priests have found their way into her land, though her border guards swear that none have crossed. She suspects that the priests have found another way into her kingdom, and she plans to hire additional forces to figure out how and put a stop to it.",

Each encounter has ended peacefully, however, with the most recent meeting ending with an exchanging of letters between the two. House Thrune's seal on each letter suggests an exchanging of state secrets, but Tessa was quick to hush the whispers aboard her ship when she returned.\n\nfigure: The lower right portion of a ship with yellow and red hull, visible rigging, and large greenish sails.

The crackle of fire in the hearth was almost louder than he was. \"I will be announcing it in two days.\"\n\nThira tensed at the words. She closed the scroll she was reading and looked up at her father, standing by the window and looking at the horizon as if he could see Valenhall already. \"Then...\" she started, but paused. She knew her father well enough. If he had spoken it, then his mind was set.\n\n\"Then I wish you safe travels,\" she said instead. She stood up, grabbing her book and her sword.\n\n\"Are you certain of your choice still?\" he asked as Thira reached the door.\n\n\"You think my brothers more capable?\" she asked.\n\n\"You know I don't,\" he said, turning to face her. \"I only question your choice of prey. The message you will send.\"\n\nThira stood by the door and looked at him. She could see worry in his eyes, though he wasn't looking at her. He was looking past her.\n\n\"Do you remember my duel with Josvein all those years ago?\" Thira spoke. \"Over his mockery when we returned from some hunt?\"\n\nThe hint of a fond smile appeared on her father's face.\n\n\"I do not remember the hunt itself anymore,\" Thira continued. \"What I do remember is how soundly I thrashed that boy, and how it didn't matter. I was called a cheater for fighting smarter, since I knew I was not as strong. A cheater for using every advantage I had.\"\n\nSveinn shook his head and looked back out the window.\n\n\"I paid attention after that. I kept my ears open. I understood. Not only was I raised in the shadows of your heroics and grand accomplishments, but I was also never the tallest and strongest child. Whoever thought of me did not think of Thira Ash-Eyes. They thought of a traitor and a witch. They thought of Sveinn Blood-Eagle's weakling daughter.\"\n\n\"You are no weakling,\" Sveinn said. \"No traitor. And no witch.\"\n\n\"What I am doesn't matter. When our own people, the so-called friends I grew up with think of me that way, what chance is there that another linnorm king will ever respect me?\"\n\nSveinn let the silence stay for a few moments.\n\n\"I worked hard to earn our lands the respect they deserve,\" he finally said.\n\n\"And I will make sure that respect isn't lost,\" Thira replied. \"I will be climbing uphill in a blizzard, but I promise I have thought about every step. We will need a strong and sturdy image when you leave, even if it has to be unfriendly at first.\"\n\nWith that, Sveinn nodded with a deep sigh, and Thira left the room.\n\nShe gathered her traveling gear and was quietly out of Kalsgard before the light of dawn.\n\n## CHALLENGE\n\nThira walked through the snow in the manner the Varki ranger had shown her when she had shared a meal and a span of time with him at his camp. He was Nankou, he had said, and he had slain his own linnorm to lay claim to the throne of Icemark. She had not heard of his victory, she said, but would take word of it to the Thanelands and from there let it spread beyond. She said nothing of his heritage, and what the Ulfen people might think of Nankou taking the title. He said nothing of her father. Thira liked him for that.\n\nShe had spent a good amount of time researching her plans, focusing on the king whom other kings scouted for, White Estrid. While learning about",

The Order of the Scourge is dedicated to apprehending criminals of every stripe, from street toughs and isolated serial killers to corrupt merchants and casually murderous aristocrats who use their positions to cover their crimes. In Cheliax, investigating the misdeeds of the powerful often ends poorly for the investigator, but Lictor Vidoc's deft political maneuvering and the long list of nobles who owe him personal favors have given the Scourge Hellknights a relatively free hand to pursue their duties.

While Vidoc had so far managed to maneuver around Abrogail's interest in him—an interest he believes may have bordered on the romantic more so than the political—he recently earned her scrutiny due to Order of the Scourge's investigation into the queen herself. The Order posits that Abrogail may have had a hand in Cheliax's recent turmoil for political or financial gain. News of Abrogail's attempts to hire Blood Mistress Jakalyn to dispatch the queen's enemies, potentially including members of the Order of the Scourge, have only pushed this investigation to the Order's highest priority. Vidoc has halted the investigation for the moment as he considers his strategy, but stirrings throughout the Order of the Scourge suggest that the Hellknights will not be daunted by Abrogail and the investigation will be moving forward. A conflict between these powers seems near inevitable.",

Craving vengeance against the nation that oversaw his imprisonment, Tar-Baphon detonated a shard of the Shield of Aroden in Vigil, vaporizing the capital city in an instant, then set his hordes of undead across the entirety of Lastwall. Ulthun fought valiantly alongside the crusaders that had once trained him, intending to die with his old comrades in accordance with the vows of self-sacrifice he had made to Iomedae over a decade past. But a group of humble goblins convinced Ulthun to stand down, begging for his help to save their tribe from the undead. Recognizing the goblins would die without someone to help them flee to safety and knowing that many knights would be too clouded by prejudice to offer assistance, the encounter reminded Ulthun that his greater duty was to his suffering people—no matter what form they took. Ulthun fled his collapsing nation with the goblins and his remaining knights at his side, vowing to one day return, bring an end to Tar-Baphon, and rebuild his home.",

There is already a lot of ink spilled about the heroics of the Pathfinder Society, the power of the city's mages leaping to its defense, and the siege weapons you designed and built (and, frankly, cosseted!) in your former role as First Siege Gear. All these helped break the siege, but all of them would have failed if we didn't have the former slaves doing the backbreaking work of defense. They were doing it for themselves, for their own city, and not out of fear of a master's lash. That made all the difference, I believe. The proudest I have ever been of the Grand Council was when they declared slavery and the slave trade illegal throughout Absalom only a few weeks after my order of manumission. It goes to show that sometimes the best in anyone—or any group—comes not by ham-handed force, but by the independence to reach for great things.",

Wynsal was then declared acting primarch until an official replacement for the position could be found. While Wynsal is happy to cede his position to a legitimately chosen successor, his impeccable character and effective governance have led many to voice their support for Wynsal being appointed to the primarchy in truth. This popularity, especially among Wynsal's former underlings in Absalom's military forces, has caused other political hopefuls to see Wynsal as a threat to their ambitions, and rumors have been spread by the nobility that Wynsal is intending a military coup. That Wynsal has been retired from the military and serving as a politician for over a decade hardly matters, as matters of truth rarely do in politics.",

Her outspoken abolitionist stances have impressed the country's slaves and Sarenites as much as they have discomfited Qadiran traditionalists. At least for the moment, Xerbystes seems unconcerned by her habit of upbraiding genie binders in the streets, a fact that has endeared her new husband to her. The two also share a mutual fondness for her distant cousin **Layilah** (NG female human priestess of Sarenrae), who both believe would be an excellent candidate for heir to the Kelesh imperial throne. While she is still far from trusting her husband with her heart, or the extent of her plans about reforming Qadira, the shahiyan has found Xerbystes to be more than the warmonger she had resigned herself to marrying.",

When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion.

A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie's elemental trait.\n\nGenie-touched companions can choose from the following options when they become specialized animal companions.",

Wynsal would like to see the exiled Watcher-Lord Ulthun II elected to the role to help Absalom fight against Tar-Baphon, who sieged Absalom once before, and to ensure Absalom remains independent—as other candidates for the primarchy, such as those loyal to Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian, would prefer to see Absalom annexed into another nation. To add to Absalom's problems, Lictor Toulon Vidoc of the Hellknights has been fed bad evidence that Wynsal was the one who disposed of the rightful primarch, and the Order of the Scourge is now determined to investigate.",
