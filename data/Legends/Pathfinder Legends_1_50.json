But it is also populated by people, from the rulers of empires to the rebels that work to bring down their regimes, and everything in between. Heroes must navigate relationships with a variety of people to further their quests, including smugglers, mages, scholars, artists, wealthy collectors, evangelists, and charlatans. From encounters with the people that populate their world, PCs can make friends, learn new skills, buy armor and weapons, gain information, and even enjoy a good meal. As adventurers become more powerful, authority figures might draw them into complex strategies and schemes or ask them to solve complicated problems. Heroes might spend only a single hour or a day with a given NPC, or they might form enduring friendships and relationships. So too might these characters become one-time enemies or even persistent antagonists; heroes might repeatedly encounter the same opponents, as the fortunes of war and the rise and fall of different nations and philosophies shape their world.",

Abrogail would occasionally appear to be caught up in a romance or taken with a new celebrity, but such fancies were never unmotivated. The calculations behind all of her actions, even in adolescence, were in the name of power. But, in House Thrune, power is the only means to ensure survival.",

Her word carries the full weight of law, although it is far from immutable. In fact, she frequently changes her mind and has her former edicts erased from the books of Chelaxian history; overnight, even the direst decrees become outdated and are no longer enforced. Keenly aware of her reputation as being immature, capricious, and demanding, Abrogail cleverly uses this image to keep those who underestimate her off-balance. Yet she controls the fractious noble houses and byzantine bureaucracy of Cheliax predominantly through fear. Against those who offend her personally, her favorite punishment is petrification\u2014an eternity in stone under her watchful eye in the Imperial Palace. These ornamental traitors further serve to remind every visitor, courtier, slave, and fiend of the majestrix\u2019s supreme authority.\n\nfigure: A hand holding a golden, ornate sword with a crossguard shaped like bat wings.

As a result, Andira grew up a happy child without wants or complaints. As a gift for her fifteenth birthday, Andira\u2019s parents paid for a voyage to Niswan in Jalmeray. A set of slaver galleys ambushed Andira\u2019s ship during her return journey, and she soon found herself the latest in a group of slaves serving as rowers. After several months Andira lost all hope of ever returning home, until a fleet of Gray Corsair ships found the trio of galleys and liberated Andira in the process. Among the Gray Corsairs was a woman named **Andira Galimnos** (LG female human Gray Corsair); the young Andira believed the fact that two shared a name to be more than mere coincidence.

The young Andira was a voracious learner, studying diplomacy, negotiation tactics, politics, and philosophy with the same zeal that she carried on the battlefield.

He uses the confusion caused by this image as a tool of intimidation, appearing unarmed before other warlords,\n\nfigure: The left edge of the image contains a partial illustration of a curved, dark horn or tusk, possibly part of a stylized orc or creature.

They grew up in Kalabuto, though the exact details of their youth are unclear. Some claim to have seen them begging in the streets, left alone in the world. Others will swear they were the child of one of the secretaries to a councilor in Eleder, seeing firsthand what Chelaxian rule did to people who once spoke of the importance of their culture and history\u2014how they threw it away so simply, and how corruption festered. Still others say they lived a relatively easy life in Freehold and only began to question their status and situation as Salgarth began to plot the \u201crestructuring\u201d of their home. Some whisper Avarneus has the standoffish, overly quiet inconspicuousness of someone from the hive of criminals and ne\u2019er-do-wells of Crown\u2019s End.",

However, it quickly became apparent that many things they seemed to have such easy access to were almost entirely closed off from those who shared their idealistic vision, as information and the trust needed to gain it were in short supply for natives of what would soon be Vidrian. So Avarneus took up the role that was needed without anyone asking. They used their privileges, access, and guile to embed themself and other skilled spies in Sargava\u2019s colonial government. Key shipping routes and schedules, no matter how altered or convoluted, were disrupted and taken by pirates. The worst atrocities of cruel colonial rulers always seemed to end up presented to sympathetic eyes and hearts, who would then sever ties. Senior officials jumped at the offers of a Mwangi agent willing to sell out burgeoning rebellions, never assuming they might be sold out in turn. Slowly but surely, Sargava\u2019s elite reconsidered how tenuous their hold truly was due to the tireless and thankless work of Avarneus and others. When victory finally came, Avarneus was arrested as a perceived collaborator, but they took solace in the fact that their home would be in good hands. They were quietly surprised to see how many vouched for them in the fledgling Vidrian council\u2019s trials.",

Some say that Azarersi is the last surviving general of the Goblinblood Wars, while others insist she was the brutal Shriekwood Slayer who plundered Molthune\u2019s forests for a decade. Still other rumors claim she mastered a great god of the Darklands and chained it as her slave. Though these rumors are obviously embellished, there is a grain of truth to each. General Azarersi did fight in the Goblinblood Wars, she did raid Molthune for years, and a mighty barghest served her throughout the Ironfang Legion\u2019s campaigns.

Long ago and far away, there lived a little girl. One day, the girl hid from a blizzard in a valley, where she found a rowan tree next to a spring. The little girl was cold and tired, and she bathed in the spring... and the tree spoke to her. The rowan taught her secrets of birch and oak and ash, songs of wolves and stories of birds, and the wise tree taught her deep and ancient magic. When the little girl left the tree, she was no little girl, but a woman and a witch.\n\n\u201cThe witch lived with many peoples, learning more of power and magic. But as her fame spread, more and more people came to ask her for help. Some tried to force her, but forcing a witch never works the way people think it does. Others begged her, and the witch hated the begging. Why, the witch thought, did all these people come to her with problems instead of solving them for themselves?\n\n\u201cSo the witch started asking higher and higher prices from those who came to her. She asked for buckets of gold and threw them down the well. She asked for tracts of land and never visited them. She asked a man to cut off his ears to heal his blindness. She asked a farmer to burn his fields to save his cows. She asked for a child to cook her pet dog to give her parents wealth and glory. And people did all these things. The witch grew angrier and angrier with everyone\u2019s begging, until she grew a wrinkle for every question asked and a wart for every favor given.",

She was the most effective ruler Edasseril had ever seen, but even as her nation prospered, Belimarius never enjoyed the respect of her fellow runelords.

As king, Choral was a remote and terrifying figure, little seen by his people and less loved. Except for his rare, unpredictable tours across Brevoy\u2014tours that he used primarily to visit terrible retribution on wayward vassals, to remind them of the price of disloyalty\u2014Choral rarely left his seat of power in New Stetven.  \n  Without Choral or his heirs to maintain unity, the nation of Brevoy has remained split at the seams. Old rivalries and new grudges have pushed the Issians and Rostlanders to the brink of civil war. Yet some few still fear this political infighting will only attract the return and wrath of House Rogarvia, and that those who fight for the right of rule will pay the price for presuming to lay claim to King Choral\u2019s crown.",

Eutropia\u2019s agents managed to resurrect her, Carrius stepped down, and Eutropia became grand princess; public opinion is that she faked her death. Their skepticism is unsurprising, given Eutropia seems to have weathered her own homicide without so much as a chipped nail or ruffled feather.

Dominicus Rell, the leader of the Lion Blades, continues to serve Eutropia as he did her father, and acts as her liaison to the more recalcitrant nobles. Dominicus seems distressingly loyal to the nation of Taldor, though his struggles with Eutropia over who ultimately has control over the other are quite fascinating to watch.",

In the aftermath, there was no sign of Geb\u2019s rival archmage, who had escaped into a magical refuge only to vanish from Golarion entirely. While history claimed this as Geb\u2019s victory, it rang hollow to the necromancer, who believed Nex had not only survived his final attack but was merely biding his time until the chance came to retaliate. Geb scoured the globe for any power that would let him discover Nex\u2019s true fate, until he drove himself into despair with his own paranoia and finally took his own life. Yet even death could not deny Geb\u2019s vendetta; consumed by anguish and surrounded by necromancy, his suicide trapped his spirit on the Material Plane as a ghost.\n\nWith no purpose and no escape, Geb languished on the throne of a kingdom he felt no affection for. Many of his subjects chose to follow Geb into undeath, leaving him with the rotting corpse of the nation he had founded. His only relief came in the form of tiny sparks of emotion across the ages, when it seemed something might challenge him. When the Holy Knights of Ozem attacked his kingdom, he retaliated by stealing the corpse of their god\u2019s deceased herald, Arazni, and turning her into his undead queen regent. When the armies of Holomog marched on Geb\u2019s borders, he unleashed a spell that turned every warrior to stone and rained down a cataclysm on their capital city. No matter how many potential rivals rose against him, none could withstand even his opening salvo. Each time he dashed a new foe, he sank deeper into despair, unmoved by opponents that lacked even a fraction of Nex\u2019s power.",

At the same time, if there is any magician\nwho has left more of a scar on the world than Hao Jin, it\u2019s Geb, through his war with\nhis rival Nex. With rumors of Nex\u2019s potential return and Geb\u2019s obvious preparations\nto resume the war, Hao Jin wonders whether she would be returning the sites only to\nsee them destroyed, or worse yet, if Geb might use them to inflict some new horror.\nPressure from the aeons of Axis, who seek the return of the lost sites regardless of the\nmoral consequences, has only further burdened her conscience.",
