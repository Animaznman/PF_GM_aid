While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced\u2014good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn\u2019t factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are",

Each encounter has ended peacefully, however, with the most recent meeting ending with an exchanging of letters between the two.

The crackle of fire in the hearth was almost louder than he was. \u201cI will be announcing it in two days.\u201d\n\nThira tensed at the words. She closed the scroll she was reading and looked up at her father, standing by the window and looking at the horizon as if he could see Valenhall already. \u201cThen...\u201d she started, but paused. She knew her father well enough. If he had spoken it, then his mind was set.\n\n\u201cThen I wish you safe travels,\u201d she said instead. She stood up, grabbing her book and her sword.\n\n\u201cAre you certain of your choice still?\u201d he asked as Thira reached the door.\n\n\u201cYou think my brothers more capable?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t,\u201d he said, turning to face her. \u201cI only question your choice of prey. The message you will send.\u201d\n\nThira stood by the door and looked at him. She could see worry in his eyes, though he wasn\u2019t looking at her. He was looking past her.\n\n\u201cDo you remember my duel with Josvein all those years ago?\u201d Thira spoke. \u201cOver his mockery when we returned from some hunt?\u201d\n\nThe hint of a fond smile appeared on her father\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI do not remember the hunt itself anymore,\u201d Thira continued. \u201cWhat I do remember is how soundly I thrashed that boy, and how it didn\u2019t matter. I was called a cheater for fighting smarter, since I knew I was not as strong. A cheater for using every advantage I had.\u201d\n\nSveinn shook his head and looked back out the window.\n\n\u201cI paid attention after that. I kept my ears open. I understood. Not only was I raised in the shadows of your heroics and grand accomplishments, but I was also never the tallest and strongest child. Whoever thought of me did not think of Thira Ash-Eyes. They thought of a traitor and a witch. They thought of Sveinn Blood-Eagle\u2019s weakling daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are no weakling,\u201d Sveinn said. \u201cNo traitor. And no witch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I am doesn\u2019t matter. When our own people, the so-called friends I grew up with think of me that way, what chance is there that another linnorm king will ever respect me?\u201d\n\nSveinn let the silence stay for a few moments.\n\n\u201cI worked hard to earn our lands the respect they deserve,\u201d he finally said.\n\n\u201cAnd I will make sure that respect isn\u2019t lost,\u201d Thira replied. \u201cI will be climbing uphill in a blizzard, but I promise I have thought about every step. We will need a strong and sturdy image when you leave, even if it has to be unfriendly at first.\u201d\n\nWith that, Sveinn nodded with a deep sigh, and Thira left the room.\n\nShe gathered her traveling gear and was quietly out of Kalsgard before the light of dawn.\n\n## CHALLENGE\n\nThira walked through the snow in the manner the Varki ranger had shown her when she had shared a meal and a span of time with him at his camp. He was Nankou, he had said, and he had slain his own linnorm to lay claim to the throne of Icemark. She had not heard of his victory, she said, but would take word of it to the Thanelands and from there let it spread beyond. She said nothing of his heritage, and what the Ulfen people might think of Nankou taking the title. He said nothing of her father. Thira liked him for that.\n\nShe had spent a good amount of time researching her plans, focusing on the king whom other kings scouted for, White Estrid. While learning about",

The Order of the Scourge is dedicated to apprehending criminals of every stripe, from street toughs and isolated serial killers to corrupt merchants and casually murderous aristocrats who use their positions to cover their crimes. In Cheliax, investigating the misdeeds of the powerful often ends poorly for the investigator, but Lictor Vidoc\u2019s deft political maneuvering and the long list of nobles who owe him personal favors have given the Scourge Hellknights a relatively free hand to pursue their duties.

Though Ulthun genuinely cares for his brother-in-arms, he also hopes that his relationship with Wynsal will pave the way for a long-term relationship with Absalom\u2019s Grand Council. To this end, Ulthun actively wants Wynsal to remain the acting primarch or seek a full appointment as primarch of Absalom, even though he knows that Wynsal hopes to replace himself with a legitimate successor. Ironically, Wynsal seems to consider Ulthun II the ideal candidate for that replacement.",

There is already a lot of ink spilled about the heroics of the Pathfinder Society, the power of the city\u2019s mages leaping to its defense, and the siege weapons you designed and built (and, frankly, cosseted!) in your former role as First Siege Gear. All these helped break the siege, but all of them would have failed if we didn\u2019t have the former slaves doing the backbreaking work of defense. They were doing it for themselves, for their own city, and not out of fear of a master\u2019s lash. That made all the difference, I believe. The proudest I have ever been of the Grand Council was when they declared slavery and the slave trade illegal throughout Absalom only a few weeks after my order of manumission. It goes to show that sometimes the best in anyone\u2014or any group\u2014comes not by ham-handed force, but by the independence to reach for great things.",

Wynsal was then declared acting primarch until an official replacement for the position could be found.

This popularity, especially among Wynsal\u2019s former underlings in Absalom\u2019s military forces, has caused other political hopefuls to see Wynsal as a threat to their ambitions, and rumors have been spread by the nobility that Wynsal is intending a military coup.

A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1.

If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type.
