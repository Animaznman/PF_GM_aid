## WALKENA, THE CHILD GOD
Over a century ago, the city-state of Mzali was largely in disarray. Yet one day, a group of priests discovered the mummified body of Walkena in an old temple. The discovery attracted attention <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.071,r=0.363,b=0.173), with ID ec47cc3f-287c-41ee-b1ca-f2da83f202f3 -->

not only from pilgrims from every
corner of the Mwangi Expanse but also
from Sargavan colonists determined to
conquer the city and plunder its riches.
Before the Sargavan armies could reach
Mzali, however, Walkena suddenly rose
from the dead. The child-mummy brought
down sunfire on the attackers, and then
declared himself ruler of the city. The
people of Mzali thought that they would
finally live in a paradise, but the child
god’s short temper, unreasonable laws,
and apparent desire to conquer his fellow
Mwangi quickly proved that such a hope
was not in Mzali’s future. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.173,r=0.365,b=0.403), with ID 13688c16-935e-4485-9d6c-28e110c66a3f -->

Summary : This illustration features three distinct objects: a black statue of a seated animal, a silver anthropomorphic figure with a feline head holding a spiked mace, and a large ornate golden shield with a lion motif. The objects are arranged in a collage style with no visible background context.

Chohar, the Sun God of Noon [LG]
The Lion God of justice, loyalty, and work. He is most commonly depicted as a golden lion with a sun for a mane. Some priests of Walkena claim that the child god is a descendant of Chohar, because of their shared love of justice—yet Walkena’s justice is vindictive and cruel, while Chohar’s is one of duty.

# TAARGICK’S LEGACY
While Taargick is a mythical figure among the dwarves of Avistan and Garund, he is not as well-known among dwarves in other parts of Golarion. During the Quest for Sky, many dwarf clans went in their own directions in hopes of finding a more suitable route to reach Golarion’s surface. Over the centuries, these clans lost contact with the main group that emerged in the Inner Sea region and eventually completed the quest independently. As a result, the dwarves of Arcadia, Tian Xia, and Casmaron each have their own stories and heroes, though they recognize Taargick’s importance to the Inner Sea region. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.069,r=0.365,b=0.329), with ID 58603d17-cd3b-41d9-8283-6b56d20a0bff -->

# TAARGICK

## FIRST HIGH KING OF THE DWARVES, KING OF SKY

**LG MALE DWARF ARISTOCRAT**  
Taargick is the most famous and storied of all dwarven rulers in the Inner Sea region, for he united the dwarf clans, founded the kingdom of Tar Taargadth, oversaw the completion of the Quest for Sky, and designed many of the first Sky Citadels. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.070,r=0.911,b=0.187), with ID d043bfcc-fff1-4d19-8189-eab02c6a0e2b -->

The mighty dwarven leader known as Taargick was born in the Darklands in –5293
AR, the night the Starstone crashed into the surface world. His mother was Hilgart,
a military commander and war oracle for the dwarven nation of Felgunn, one of a
dozen or more subterranean kingdoms ruled by dwarves at the time. When Earthfall
struck and many dwarves—taking this as a divine sign from Torag—called for a
start to the Quest for Sky, most Felgunn citizens resisted the call, but Hilgart was not
among them. Infant Taargick on her hip, she marched forth within days of Earthfall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.188,r=0.914,b=0.296), with ID 3457f526-8c29-428c-9ade-68dfafec1cd3 -->

Thus, Taargick grew up always on the move, born to a life of constant struggle and divinely mandated hardship. As he came into maturity, Taargick wished to be a warrior, but his mother insisted he learn many different skills. She ensured he was trained in diplomacy, engineering, logistics, and religious rites and doctrines along with his martial training. Because he was clever, strong, and courageous, Taargick was often assigned to work groups when major issues arose in moving an entire people in an endless march, and he became well known and liked over his first two and a half centuries of life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.296,r=0.914,b=0.417), with ID f611e93a-0049-480b-8753-16c5da4d64c1 -->

At the Battle of Basalt Grimm in –5153 AR, the united dwarven front was ambushed by a massed orc horde. Having been relentlessly driven from their homes and forced further and further toward the surface by the marching dwarven host, scores of orc clans found their hatred of the dwarves a bond strong enough to band together. The dwarven vanguard collapsed, and orc raiders struck deep behind the dwarven front lines. Thousands of dwarven civilians, children, and elders were slain, including Hilgart. The dwarves were overcome by shame and anger, and abandoned the Quest for Sky to pursue vengeance against all orcs.

Without the unity of their shared mission, various dwarven
factions began to press for greater control of the once-mobile
nation’s resources. For the first several years of this time,
Taargick was as obsessed with vengeance as his compatriots.
But as time passed, dwarven factions began to vocally
suggest settling where they were, or even returning to their
original homes. Taargick was horrified at the idea that all
the suffering and work the dwarven people had undertaken
might be put aside without accomplishing their divinely
mandated goal and began passionately speaking in favor of a
the Quest for Sky. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.572,r=0.916,b=0.736), with ID cfb67cb0-1316-48fb-92a7-69afbae3e210 -->

His deep connections to different dwarf factions served Taarqick in
good stead, and many flocked to his call. They named themselves after
him, calling the alliance Tar Taargadth. Over a few years, this alliance
grew, in large part due to Taarqick’s reputation as a hard-working,
brave dwarf of skill and determination. When Taarqick began
the work of actually mobilizing the dwarves once again,
however, some well-entrenched factions refused his call
and challenged his right to rule. Taarqick called out the
leader of the largest of these factions, Hrungul Ironeye, to a trial by
single combat, which Taarqick narrowly won. Hrungul became one of
Taarqick’s most fervent supporters and sent his own guards to “escort”
other recalcitrant dwarven elders to a ceremony where Taarqick was named
High King of the nation of Tar Taargadth, the first dwarf to ever hold such a title. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.736,r=0.914,b=0.940), with ID 51d951e3-2144-4a2b-9c93-acd7ee4680c9 -->

With renewed purpose, the dwarves of Tar Taargadth completed the Quest for Sky within a year, discovering they had paused within a thousand feet of the surface. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.078,r=0.618,b=0.127), with ID 861fef21-3dbe-47c6-a80c-e577061182fb -->

# SKY CITADELS
Following the successful conclusion to the Quest for Sky, Taargick set about attempting to ensure the dwarven kingdom could survive the new dangerous and harsh conditions of the surface world. He drew about him the greatest minds he could find, dwarf and surface-dweller alike, to design massive fortresses that came to be called Sky Citadels. Each of these was the pinnacle of dwarven engineering, architecture, science, and military strategy, designed to serve as fortress, administrative center, city, academy and, in times of great risk, final redoubt. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.138,r=0.616,b=0.264), with ID 9072362e-5065-4829-9694-b708b6bf35d0 -->

The first Sky Citadel to be designed was Koldukar, built at one of the sites where the dwarves emerged onto the surface of Golarion. Taargick himself surfaced and saw the sky for the first time at this location, and he intended to make it the center of the kingdom of Tar Taargadth. It was from here Taargick ruled over the nation that bore his name during the height of its success. But they were also years of endless conflict, much of it with Darklands creatures that had been driven before the dwarven march, and Taargick’s name was among the most hated by those displaced peoples. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.265,r=0.615,b=0.387), with ID 45c98f65-6c13-44c1-9264-62145ae7eb93 -->

The second Sky Citadel was Dongun Hold, far to the south of the dwarven
emergence point on the surface and built as part of an alliance with Osirion.
Taarigk envisioned Dongun Hold as the first of many far-flung outposts of Tar
Taargadth, connected to one another by tunnels through the upper reaches of
Nar-Voth, the uppermost layer of the Darklands. Because Dongun Hold was so
far removed from central Tar Taargadth, it was assigned to one of Taarigk’s most
trusted generals to command, the Mistress-of-Fire Arnhild Arunak. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.388,r=0.615,b=0.494), with ID f803cda7-f3fb-430e-8f03-b6e1600045a3 -->

As Taargick approached an impressive 600th year, a grand tomb was built for him in Koldukar, but the aged High King feared entombing him within it would subject the first Sky Citadel to endless attacks by those who hated his legacy. Instead he abdicated the throne, donned his old adamantine armor, and marched off to find a place to die and be buried in obscurity. Despite his sacrifice, long after Taargick’s reign ended, Koldukar fell to orc invaders, who renamed it Urgir and claimed it as the capitol of their own nation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.495,r=0.614,b=0.601), with ID ca9789f6-9c19-4532-97e1-8aca672fa419 -->

# ECHOES FROM THE ANCESTORS
Taargick remains one of the most revered and beloved of dwarven heroes millennia after his death. His name can inspire dwarves of every heritage, and still rouse anger in traditional enemies of dwarvenkind. A single scrap of adamantine armor with the dwarven runes for the King of Sky has turned up in a small market hidden in the alleys of Absalom, supposedly sold by an adventurer who took it from an orc bandit’s corpse. The location of Taargick’s final resting place remains unknown, and if orcs have breached that holy site, it is imperative it be located and reconsecrated so the first High King may rest in peace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.613,r=0.615,b=0.754), with ID 1a04c52f-838f-4c67-83f1-c1f0a51882ac -->

And in Dongun Hold, a long sealed-away library was uncovered as High King Anong Arunak prepared the undercity as a shelter for a potential war, and the last papers of Taargick were found. They included a long missive where Taargick admitted his regrets for not seeking a more peaceful solution to the war that drove the orcs from their homeland, and a wish that an orc king existed that Taargick could send his apologies to.

Summary : This image shows a cylindrical container with metallic gold-colored end caps and a transparent blue central section, within which a humanoid figure is suspended in a swirling, icy environment.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a cylindrical capsule or canister, vertically oriented.
  • The capsule has metallic gold-colored end caps at the top and bottom, with mechanical or industrial design elements.
  • The central section is transparent and filled with a blue, icy or crystalline substance.
  • Inside the blue section, a humanoid figure is visible, apparently frozen or suspended in the middle of swirling, icy patterns.
  • The lighting is even, with the blue glow of the central section providing the main color accent.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or measurement indicators are present.
  • The image is a digital illustration, not a photograph of a real object.
  • The humanoid figure appears to be encased in ice or a similar translucent material.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The capsule is centered in the frame, with the figure centrally located within the blue section.
  • The swirling icy patterns spiral around the figure, emphasizing its containment.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates the concept of containment or preservation, possibly of a person or entity in stasis or cryogenic suspension.
  • The use of blue and gold colors, along with the mechanical design, suggests a science fiction or fantasy context.
  • The swirling patterns and the posture of the figure reinforce the idea of being frozen or immobilized within the capsule. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.664,t=0.060,r=0.853,b=0.389), with ID fbff9f1a-412d-4218-97d7-6949062803f0 -->

# STRANGE TRUTHS
The location of the original homeland of Taargick, Felgunn, has long been lost to time—but an ancient sliver of map on a clay tablet suggests it is located deep below Hagegraf, a major duergar city itself beneath the Five Kings Mountains. The same tablet claims Hagegraf was first named “New Felgunn,” which would suggest some dwarves of Felgunn, including some closely related to Taargick, rejected the Quest for Sky and may have been among the first to become duergar. The proof of duergar related to Taargick would send a shock wave through dwarf society, and an expedition would surely be assembled to prove or disprove the theory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.640,t=0.398,r=0.876,b=0.694), with ID 5c37a723-ee01-4d51-9dce-ee451738c7b4 -->

THE WHISPERING TYRANT  
NE MALE HUMAN LICH NECROMANCER  
Countless books tell of Tar-Baphon and his ongoing legacy; entire ancient libraries, saturated with rumors and intrigue, would not be enough to house the documentation of his influence. The record goes thusly: he was once an exceptionally spoiled and gifted student who fell to the temptation of the writings of the last Runelord of Gluttony, Zutha. Tar-Baphon dug a portal to the Negative Energy Plane on the Isle of Terror, ignited a long-lived rivalry with the god Aroden, descended to lichdom, took Ustalav beneath his might, then was imprisoned in Gallowspire and subsequently escaped. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.107,r=0.915,b=0.264), with ID 42e32206-2685-449f-b602-a89f4b6bb811 -->

Larger still is his unwritten legacy. His morbid cult of acolytes, the Whispering Way, maintain a 10,000-year-long oral history exchanged only in hushed murmurs. They speak of his leadership with great reverence and eagerly await his plans for the future. These days, the Whispering Tyrant appears not only as a vigilant, violent warlord but as a boogeyman in the minds of even the most innocent; villagers often claim to see him in a farmyard after dark or lurking in a graveyard just at the edge of a mourner’s vision.

He has escaped from his prison at Gallowspire, where he was once locked in by the *Great Seal*—the name of his prison only flared his ambitious fervor and arrogance when he destroyed it with his magical superweapon, the *Radiant Fire*. Imprisonment on his own throne did not temper his hubris or his ego—it only gave him more time to plot his escape and his plans beyond. Now that he’s made his way out, he has only the cruelest of intentions; he plans to leverage his stolen power, his vast legions of enslaved minions, and the Whispering Way to achieve his long-awaited goals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.381,t=0.265,r=0.916,b=0.527), with ID 9d9a9810-29f2-4010-a500-909a92b45c3b -->

**THOSE AFFECTED**  
The Tyrant has perhaps touched as many lives—and deaths and undeaths—as any god. In his calamitous grasp for divinity, he has transformed into something of a miasmatic vertex, connecting vast group of nations and individuals alike simply by means of his generations-long campaign of destruction and fear. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.536,r=0.915,b=0.632), with ID 5df2ae22-ef72-4e0e-b9f7-28ebd180c7e1 -->

In expanding his power, Tar-Baphon sought to act on the
ancient oaths that the orcs swore to him. And yet, when he sent
his undead messengers, their mounts were sent back with the
corpses of their riders decapitated, and with their proposals stuffed
into their exposed necks. The Whispering Tyrant was not accustomed
to trifling petulance, and sent an army to force compliance, only to see
his forces routed by the united orc holds. To add further insult, the orc
overlord Ardax named one of the trophies of his kills—a skull from
one of Tar-Baphon’s felled minions—after Tar-Baphon and placed
cow horns on its head as a mockery of his enemy. The brazen taunt
has filled the Tyrant with a renewed wave of malevolence and a
determination to strike down the orc’s haphazard allegiances.
Tar-Baphon’s vicious stubbornness is both his virtue and his
downfall; the orcs may soon know the brunt of his maliciousness
much more intimately. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.444,t=0.633,r=0.916,b=0.860), with ID 5e0a74cd-9c92-41aa-b2dc-94abab4c4394 -->

The nation of Razmiran and Tar-Baphon have entered into
something of an unsteady agreement; Razmir has publicly signaled
that he will not outright oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as Tar-
Baphon does not disturb the realm of Razmiran. This unofficial treaty
leaves Razmiran standing among a small host of those neutral on the matter <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.396,t=0.862,r=0.915,b=0.940), with ID 7a97699d-39ad-43fc-968b-13f3a62fd992 -->

of the Tyrant, though it is difficult to distinguish neutral parties from those too
terrified to speak. Those listening to the abounding whispers have heard claims
that Razmiran may be handing its dead off to Tar-Baphon as payment in exchange
for peace, but nothing has been proven beyond furtive rumors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.078,r=0.620,b=0.142), with ID 6f1df448-0aa7-4b92-9a9c-b52b235aa045 -->

The knights of Lastwall continue to oppose the Tyrant in every way they
can, with heroes such as Kalabrynne Iomedar and Clarethe Iomedar serving
on the front lines and former watcher-lord Ulthun II rallying other nations to
fight the lich’s forces. Tar-Baphon’s escape from Gallowspire also caused the
self-proclaimed Speaker of All the World’s Tales, a half-elf called Janatimo, to
advocate for a Magaambyan presence in Avistan in the hopes of studying the
Tyrant’s escape and helping the survivors of his destruction. Thus far, Tar-Baphon
has not paid mind to the many efforts to aid the scattered, desperate populations
of the Gravelands, but there is no guarantee that he will merely let them be once
he does. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.142,r=0.620,b=0.294), with ID 91787360-9ffc-4026-a958-bbbc65012788 -->

Achakek, the patron god of the Red Mantis assassins, has a long history of thwarting attempts at divinity both with his own power and with the skill of his assassins. Their human leader, Blood Mistress Jakalyn, recently received a mysterious offer of payment for Tar-Baphon’s assassination. While not explicitly opposed to Tar-Baphon, the Red Mantis are infamous for ending the aspirations of would-be divine entities. The shadowy messenger, perhaps, hoped to rile the Red Mantis, the Blood Mistress, and their assassins—with Tar-Baphon’s well-known attempts at divinity and his many illegitimate reigns, the messenger seemed to believe that this would be an eagerly accepted contract. Blood Mistress Jakalyn, however, knew better than to take the offer at face value and investigated the proposal before deciding whether she would accept it. She discovered that the origin of the offer of payment for Tar-Baphon’s assassination was from within Razmiran—obfuscating an already muddy relationship between the two nations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.295,r=0.620,b=0.497), with ID 9462c1c9-f772-4a34-8f11-ec4a84999013 -->

# MACHINATIONS PRESENT AND FUTURE
The machinations of the Tyrant are many, mighty, and all in the interest of expanding his already vast influence on Golarion. The _final blades_ of Galt are of special interest to Tar-Baphon; these guillotines store the souls of their condemned inside of them, and only Galt’s executioners, the Gray Gardeners, know how to release the trapped souls. Tar-Baphon does not seek to destroy the blades out of any desire for justice, but simply to break the blood-stained wood open like a pomegranate and take the many trapped souls within to add to his undead hordes. Rumors swirl that the Whispering Way has taken measures to scope out the _final blades’_ locations and their protectors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.504,r=0.620,b=0.663), with ID 1d3cd535-42be-420b-9f86-d69fc7e7ca08 -->

His most cherished goal, as it has been since his youth, is ascension to divinity.
In 1 AR, Tar-Baphon’s rival Aroden lifted the *Starstone* from the bottom of
the Inner Sea and became a living god, creating Absalom and the Starstone
Cathedral. Since then, the Test of the *Starstone* has allowed anyone who can
overcome its many trials to receive divinity. Only three of many have passed,
including Iomedae, a follower of Aroden’s cause who later became his herald. To
Tar-Baphon, the entire test and city smacks of Aroden’s smugness and victory—
though Aroden may be dead by mysterious circumstances, Tar-Baphon is still
not content to leave his rival’s successes be. He is not so much interested in
taking the test of *Starstone* as he is on taking everything: the cathedral, Absalom,
the *Starstone*, all of it. His unfettered ambition will turn a vessel of divinity into
a mere plaything for his undying rule. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.662,r=0.620,b=0.849), with ID 14c85117-12eb-4fdf-a782-97573761e687 -->

FAMILIAR FACES  
The lich Tar-Baphon has been a plague on modern-day Golarion even before he broke free from his prison of Gallowspire to continue his reign of terror. His agents in the Whispering Way concocted a plot to free him in the Carrion Crown Adventure Path, only to be foiled by a group of cunning investigators, as played by the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.635,t=0.336,r=0.886,b=0.502), with ID d1301cce-bfee-4b96-b27d-cff1818d4c95 -->

Tar-Baphon redoubled his efforts  
to escape, eventually discovering  
a means to channel his magic into  
a devastating discharge known as  
the *Radiant Fire*. The destruction  
that followed made up the events of  
the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path.  
*Legends* assumes that Tar-Baphon’s  
inexorable march on Absalom was  
ended by a group of tragic heroes  
whom he had callously slaughtered  
alongside their neighbors, and who  
returned from the Boneyard to find a  
means to stop the Whispering Tyrant  
by turning his unstoppable arcane  
power back upon him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.636,t=0.509,r=0.882,b=0.757), with ID 5a44f1a7-c71c-4dd8-9c64-724b3197a7ab -->

Summary : This image shows a decorative vertical table of contents or index, likely from a book or game manual, with section headings and page navigation cues, overlaid on a blue and gold ornamental banner.

# THE VIRIDIAN CROWN
An artifact thousands of years old, the *Viridian Crown* has been worn by the monarch of Kyonin since the nation was founded. It is claimed to sprout vicious thorns in times of war, though no such sight has been seen under Queen Telandia’s rule. That may soon change, however, and elven courtiers watch the queen’s circlet for early signs that Telandia’s thoughts might turn to battle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.068,r=0.362,b=0.253), with ID f4eb4cd2-f5ad-45a1-b4c5-d137d3eefe95 -->

NG FEMALE ELF WIZARD  
Humans may think they play the game of politics well, but they know nothing of the statecraft of elves, who have centuries at hand to plot and plan. Queen Telandia Edasseril of Kyonin plays that game better than anyone, hence keeping her throne longer than many of her fellow world leaders have been alive. The elven mage rules over her subjects with grace and skill, keeping the nation of Kyonin united despite its citizens’ dislike of anything resembling authoritarian commands. She has a steely gaze and a serious demeanor and has been described as looking more like a painting brought to life than a real person. The queen wears the traditional symbol of the Kyonin monarchy, the Viridian Crown: an enchanted circlet made of vines and flowers that change with the seasons. She has scarcely a hair out of place, though occasionally light talon marks grace her skin, a sign of the queen’s one passion aside from the throne. She is not only a skilled falconer, but magically assumes falcon form herself, flying alongside her beloved bird, Nyranin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.127,r=0.916,b=0.371), with ID c4ee61d3-cad7-42c0-bb77-c853fa3de375 -->

Telandia was born to nobility, and she learned long ago how to navigate the mazes of the powerful. Though her parents were royalty, they were not the king and queen. With Telandia a potential heir to the throne, they educated her in magic, etiquette, languages, diplomacy, history, and every other topic that could be useful to the budding leader. She made friends with all the most powerful elves, influencing with a light touch yet always making sure that everyone was in her debt, and when the King died without a child, Telandia took the throne. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.415,t=0.372,r=0.917,b=0.494), with ID 859e5938-6304-4cd0-af2e-b3af8232909f -->

She continued to ensure she knew all the movers and shakers in the kingdom, including the ambassadors from other lands. This included the Galtan representative Apalma Drannoch and her then-young daughter Camilia. Telandia suspected that the young but very forceful Camilia would grow up to either rule a country of her own or destroy one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.407,t=0.494,r=0.915,b=0.573), with ID 949c181d-bc84-4f24-a819-071b7aa2888a -->

# A ROYAL MATCH
Telandia has always willingly sacrificed her personal wants for the good of her subjects, and this remains true for her relationships as well. While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced—good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn’t factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.582,r=0.915,b=0.937), with ID 24b83343-bb1f-401c-8710-7b5d05a3f455 -->

fond of each other, and keen-eyed elves sometimes now spot three birds flying  
together near the royal residence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.079,r=0.618,b=0.111), with ID 20a6edf9-d268-412c-8ff5-d8bc6f820691 -->

This practice makes the royal guard nervous, as it seems only a matter of
time before something happens during one of the queen’s flights in bird form.
Given that this is her only real pastime that has not been sacrificed on the altar
of rulership, the queen refuses to stop flying, even if the land-bound guards can’t
keep her safe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.111,r=0.617,b=0.188), with ID 964c97bb-724b-4432-ae44-f8de350ec353 -->

# RETURN OF TAR-BAPHON
While Kyonin has a reputation of staying out of the affairs of shorter-lived peoples, recent events have demonstrated that Telandia must take a more active approach to global politics. The re-emergence of Tar-Baphon as a threat necessitates action. She has opened Kyonin to outsiders, seeking to gather allies among other nations, preparing for nearly certain war against the powerful lich. The queen is sending out missives to various countries and groups around Golarion, but she doesn’t expect all to be immediately receptive of an elven envoy. She sometimes hires groups of the same ancestry or heritage as her target ally to deliver her initial letter, reaching out for a diplomatic relationship and potential alliance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.199,r=0.616,b=0.356), with ID 6d7f5f0f-0c7d-4ee1-aff4-24115e472a05 -->

At the same time, she must placate her own elven subjects, some of whom
fear losing their small nation—one of the major bastions of the elven people
left on Golarion—to outsiders, and some of whom believe the queen should use
her new network of powerful allies to take out Treerazer (*Pathfinder Bestiary*
312) once and for all. While the queen despises the nascent demon lord of
pollution and decay, who remains festering in Tanglebriar after he conquered
part of Kyonin, she is still reluctant to rekindle an old battle on another front
with a new enemy so close at hand. She has been hiring diplomats to speak
to the agitators within the kingdom and try to steer them away from talk of
starting war with Treerazer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.357,r=0.616,b=0.509), with ID d4c92056-d9a8-4191-a13b-deadfc238d78 -->

Queen Telandia began her diplomatic outreach with those countries local to her, and thus far, these olive branches have been generally well received. Grand Princess Eutropia of Taldor sees the benefit of an alliance with the elven kingdom, as does Supreme Elect Andira Marusek of Andoran. High King **Borogrim the Hale** (LN male dwarf high king of Highhelm) of the Five Kings Mountains has always shared good relations with Telandia and recently agreed to an uneasy military alliance—while neither leader enjoys being beholden to send troops to aid the other, they have put that aside for the moment simply due to the magnitude of the threat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.510,r=0.615,b=0.647), with ID efc0c35c-749a-48b8-b89c-fe4fd1faa419 -->

However, Queen Telandia is not open to diplomatic talks with all her neighbors. The oppression of Razmiran disgusts Telandia, and Razmir has declared all elves to be heretical, leaving the two countries effectively at war. While the queen is naturally disinclined to open any discussions with Razmir, she does allow Razmirans to enter Kyonin through their shared border, so long as they are not Razmiran priests. Recently, turmoil along the Razmiran–Kyonin border has Queen Telandia suspicious that Razmiran priests have found their way into her land, though her border guards swear that none have crossed. She suspects that the priests have found another way into her kingdom, and she plans to hire additional forces to figure out how and put a stop to it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.648,r=0.615,b=0.800), with ID 3b300b54-5d54-4a02-895a-86c9796a7101 -->

Telandia has also been reluctant to seek alliance with Galt, given the constant

# DECEIVING APPEARANCES
Queen Telandia spends so much of her time on statecraft that many forget her exceptional skill in arcane magic. The royal palace is cloaked from top to bottom in illusions, and servants sometimes interact with a fellow servant that is actually the queen, or a queen that is nothing more than a figment. Most notably, Telandia has permission to scry on many of her loyal subjects, meaning any elf from Kyonin might serve as the queen’s eyes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.641,t=0.073,r=0.874,b=0.280), with ID 9fcd17a5-3387-403e-b135-2810b9e6eb7b -->

# TESSA FAIRWIND

## HURRICANE QUEEN OF THE SHACKLES

CN FEMALE HALF-ELF PIRATE
Tessa Fairwind cuts a striking figure on the prow of her ship, its proud mast and pirate flag a challenge to everyone who sees it. She can hear the welcoming shouts from other captains, the roar of commerce—the bustle and chaos of Port Peril. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.067,r=0.912,b=0.188), with ID 689ee193-9c03-4c92-8d34-b239c1a15dab -->

This is her city, her seat of power. The Hurricane Queen has come home, triumphant over Cheliax yet again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.188,r=0.913,b=0.218), with ID d987deb9-4ce5-4981-8b35-7e5650a1a54c -->

# SCOURGE OF CHELIAX
Tessa was born on the sea, the product of a brief affair between a human merchant and an elven priest of Calistria. She learned to walk on the pitching decks of her mother’s ship, and by the time she could talk, she was helping the sailors tie knots. She was her mother’s pride and despair, stealing a boat when she was only 8 years old. Her mother found her, unrepentant, in the hands of the guards and judged, correctly, that this was only the start of greater delinquency. She signed her daughter over to Captain **Karise** (N female human ship captain), a stern friend who plied dangerous routes through the High Seas with her crew. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.230,r=0.914,b=0.371), with ID a2f66439-1026-4c6f-b5f1-9fbe4fbe7d6b -->

Under Karise’s care, Tessa quickly became a competent sailor, but her wild streak never settled. At 15, she stole a Thuvian pleasure barge on a dare. Thuvian guards chased her for days before she pillaged and abandoned the barge. She escaped their grasp, but her fate was sealed by a price placed on her head. Within 3 years, her name was blazoned across the Inner Sea region, and she sailed through the arch of Aroden into the Arcadian Ocean to evade her pursuers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.389,t=0.372,r=0.913,b=0.464), with ID 0379a600-315e-403d-a920-2bb4b7ec61ae -->

Tessa set her sights on Cheliax early on, harassing their shipping routes and
playing merry havoc with their interests. She scored many victories, and the price
on her head nearly quadrupled before she turned 20. She made her
fortune off of Cheliax’s woes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.464,r=0.913,b=0.524), with ID 77668f34-bd2e-4d0a-80ff-0f51d4643080 -->

In the autumn of her twenty-third year, Tessa was caught in a trap laid by a Chelaxian captain who had been hunting her. Her ship was badly damaged, and she was knocked overboard. Chelaxian sailors scooped her up as she floated, stunned and badly wounded. She spent 2 years in a hard labor camp in the Menador Mountains before escaping. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.399,t=0.525,r=0.913,b=0.601), with ID 0e454bc6-3336-4e0a-b780-712641d6f24e -->

Tessa never showed much political drive in her early life, but her prowess and reputation as a pirate captain quickly elevated her to the Pirate Council. Very soon after, she claimed the port of Quent as her home base and was declared the town’s Mistress. She worked tirelessly to root out the traitors to the previous Hurricane King, with little success. When he fell, she eventually (though somewhat reluctantly) took the title of Hurricane Queen with her strength and guile. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.602,r=0.913,b=0.693), with ID 3656255d-29fe-45a9-9415-ad8cebac79ef -->

Tessa rules from her town house in Port Peril, on Motaku Isle, venturing into the Shackles only when needed for official business. She isn’t fond of the intrigues and endless paperwork she has found herself saddled with, but her generally affable nature and curiosity suit her new role well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.694,r=0.913,b=0.753), with ID 65bf5a01-08c5-40f5-b651-bb99b5264534 -->

# THE EYE OF THE STORM
Tessa never deliberately sought the title of Hurricane Queen, as she preferred a carefree lifestyle, but she has found that power offers her a refuge from consequences that she didn’t have before. This rush of freedom has made Tessa somewhat reckless, and while that recklessness allows bold successes like Tessa’s recent raid on Cheliax, it has left more cautious pirates worried about the inevitable backlash. Some of the other pirate lords regard Tessa as a weak and irresponsible leader, someone unworthy of representing and guiding them. Others simply covet her position or are actively scheming against her in order to open the way for a Chelaxian invasion. For now, however, Tessa is too popular to challenge, and she’s very skilled at finding ways to increase that popularity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.401,t=0.767,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID 66d402f9-e646-4225-86ef-b305450f2f3b -->

Whatever Tessa’s weaknesses, she is frightfully aware of the Chelaxian threat,
and devotes many of her resources toward monitoring their movements. Tessa
is quick to sniff out Chelaxian rats among the crews of the Free Captains, and
Queen Abrogail’s navy has lost many vessels in its attempts to capture Tessa’s ship,
_Luck of the Draw_. Rumors that the navy has recently seized the nautical chop
shop Rickety’s Squibs to help fashion a new warship capable of taking on _Luck of
the Draw_ have merely earned scoffs from Tessa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.078,r=0.619,b=0.189), with ID 8bc2b0a1-c0bd-45d7-8157-65e7810e7d87 -->

Tessa is a generally friendly and easy-going woman, honoring her commitments
and proving loyal to her allies. Although she seems careless, she is more calculating
than she lets on, and she has a reputation of getting ruthless payback on anyone
who crosses her. She is not above using her beauty and reputation—Tessa has had a
string of lovers and partners since she became a captain, most lasting no more than
a few days. She claims that a broken heart has taught her to love quickly and lightly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.189,r=0.616,b=0.280), with ID 88ff59d6-00ec-4336-b3d3-35b743e55cb2 -->

Some say she and Shimali Manux have a history, and that perhaps Shimali is the one who caused that broken heart, though such suggestions tend to quickly burn through Tessa’s good humor. The Hurricane Queen’s feelings on the Vidric captain do seem conflicted; at times, Tessa laughs at the name, claiming Manux has only luck to thank for her success. Other times, Tessa speaks of Shimali’s exploits with admiration, comparing Shimali to some more well-known sailors and even to Tessa herself. Tessa’s fickleness draws many questions from her other lieutenants, and the fact that the captains often have their confrontations interrupted by storms and other highly unlikely conveniences has only increased their suspicion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.281,r=0.616,b=0.418), with ID a389ad3e-adf1-4275-848b-0dafe009564f -->

Another possible culprit is the Vidric councilor Avarneus, whom Tessa claims courted and then betrayed her. Tessa has offered rewards for the capture of Avarneus after the spy ruined more than a few of her carefully laid plans for the invasion of Vidrian; however, she is too impetuous and easily distracted to maintain the sort of subtle hunt that might actually catch Avarneus. Tessa appears content to take her time with dealing with the spy, and Avarneus’s newer inventions always seem to eventually make their way to *Luck of the Draw*, as evidenced by the clockwork dragonfly and other innovations stashed in the captain’s quarters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.419,r=0.615,b=0.540), with ID 7e7e890f-3811-4fe9-8617-7b9ff7286614 -->

The most tempestuous of Tessa’s relationships are those with the Firebrands, particularly the Sapphire Butterfly. In public, Tessa expresses her dislike of the Firebrands, but she has quietly assisted them on occasion. She has also, much to the delight of bards everywhere, had plenty of temporary alliances and assignations with certain Firebrands, which both offer her entertainment and boost her reputation.
The Sapphire Butterfly and Tessa have had several encounters in the years since Ravounel’s founding, usually when the vigilante is aboard one of the many Vidric ships she uses to traverse the Inner Sea. Each encounter has ended peacefully, however, with the most recent meeting ending with an exchanging of letters between the two. House Thrune’s seal on each letter suggests an exchanging of state secrets, but Tessa was quick to hush the whispers aboard her ship when she returned.

# THIRA ASH-EYES

## LINNORM KING OF THE THANELANDS

N FEMALE HUMAN MAGUS  
“I am leaving for Valenhall,” Sveinn Blood-Eagle said. He spoke quietly, as if to himself. The crackle of fire in the hearth was almost louder than he was. “I will be announcing it in two days.”

Thira tensed at the words. She closed the scroll she was reading and looked up at her father, standing by the window and looking at the horizon as if he could see Valenhall already. “Then...” she started, but paused. She knew her father well enough. If he had spoken it, then his mind was set.

“Then I wish you safe travels,” she said instead. She stood up, grabbing her book and her sword.

“Are you certain of your choice still?” he asked as Thira reached the door.

“You think my brothers more capable?” she asked.

“You know I don’t,” he said, turning to face her. “I only question your choice of prey. The message you will send.”

Thira stood by the door and looked at him. She could see worry in his eyes, though he wasn’t looking at her. He was looking past her.

“Do you remember my duel with Josvein all those years ago?” Thira spoke. “Over his mockery when we returned from some hunt?”

The hint of a fond smile appeared on her father’s face.

“I do not remember the hunt itself anymore,” Thira continued. “What I do remember is how soundly I thrashed that boy, and how it didn’t matter. I was called a cheater for fighting smarter, since I knew I was not as strong. A cheater for using every advantage I had.”

Sveinn shook his head and looked back out the window.

“I paid attention after that. I kept my ears open. I understood. Not only was I raised in the shadows of your heroics and grand accomplishments, but I was also never the tallest and strongest child. Whoever thought of me did not think of Thira Ash-Eyes. They thought of a traitor and a witch. They thought of Sveinn Blood-Eagle’s weakling daughter.”

“You are no weakling,” Sveinn said. “No traitor. And no witch.”

“What I am doesn’t matter. When our own people, the so-called friends I grew up with think of me that way, what chance is there that another linnorm king will ever respect me?”

Sveinn let the silence stay for a few moments.

“I worked hard to earn our lands the respect they deserve,” he finally said.

“And I will make sure that respect isn’t lost,” Thira replied. “I will be climbing uphill in a blizzard, but I promise I have thought about every step. We will need a strong and sturdy image when you leave, even if it has to be unfriendly at first.”

With that, Sveinn nodded with a deep sigh, and Thira left the room.

She gathered her traveling gear and was quietly out of Kalsgard before the light of dawn.

## CHALLENGE

Thira walked through the snow in the manner the Varki ranger had shown her when she had shared a meal and a span of time with him at his camp. He was Nankou, he had said, and he had slain his own linnorm to lay claim to the throne of Icemark. She had not heard of his victory, she said, but would take word of it to the Thanelands and from there let it spread beyond. She said nothing of his heritage, and what the Ulfen people might think of Nankou taking the title. He said nothing of her father. Thira liked him for that.

She had spent a good amount of time researching her plans, focusing on the king whom other kings scouted for, White Estrid. While learning about <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.016,t=0.055,r=0.925,b=0.946), with ID 330fcc66-4749-4a70-83e4-190f6dce19a0 -->

White Estrid’s accomplishments and rise to power, Thira had come to respect
the other woman as a ruler and as an accomplished leader, but Thira could
already see the ugly comparisons that would be drawn between the two of
them. And so, Thira had chosen White Estrid as the target of her
message to the world of her own power and strength. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.078,r=0.622,b=0.158), with ID f9c54ea0-2ab2-47f1-acd5-31e6b7972da7 -->

Knowing White Estrid’s attachment to her crag linnorm and
her controversial choice of keeping it as a pet rather than killing
it, Thira had spent a great deal of time and effort hunting another
of its kind. The crag linnorm Thira had tracked and found months
ago was asleep when she arrived at its lair. The temptation to cut
its head off in its sleep was strong, but she was well aware she
couldn’t do that. It would have to be an honest, one-on-one fight.
Thira closed her eyes, going through the magic she had at hand
and keeping her plan in mind. With a deep breath, she jumped
down, sword at the ready, the runes on her face glowing bright.
The linnorm’s orange eyes opened and quickly focused on her. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.158,r=0.512,b=0.325), with ID 278d7f49-df08-4eac-84d4-9b5895f75ada -->

“Do you have a name?” Thira shouted, her voice echoing in the cavern.  
The linnorm rose, its head reaching up high and looking down at Thira.  
“Zahasha,” it said with a hiss, letting the sound drag on.  
“I am Thira Ash-Eyes, and I will kill you for my right to rule.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.326,r=0.615,b=0.387), with ID 5b3b86f0-7ca8-4be7-b765-2fad8bf64c47 -->

The linnorm seemed amused as it lunged for her. Thira dodged aside and let a bright green ray of light fly off her sword to strike the linnorm. Panic quickly set in behind Zahasha’s eyes as smoke rose from the horrific wound left by the spell. The linnorm’s stance changed, from a hunter toying with its food to prey fighting for survival. It rushed her again, and this time Thira let her guard down, letting the claws rake across her body. She could feel the bright burn as it ripped open wounds upon her arm, yet the creature was weaker than she had expected. Thira conjured another spell and then faltered for a moment; she couldn’t risk destroying the linnorm’s head. In that moment of hesitation, the linnorm rounded on her, its tail wrapping around her and pulling her toward its venomous teeth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.386,r=0.615,b=0.539), with ID 4d3e46ff-fed0-44ff-98c0-3216da919e9b -->

Thira took the risk, channeling powerful life-draining magic through her sword. As soon as the sword hit the linnorm’s neck, the spell took effect, nearly jerking the blade from her grasp as it sank deeper. The horrified linnorm clawed at her, to no avail, as Thira pushed on. The tail let go just as the creature’s head fell to the ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.540,r=0.616,b=0.617), with ID 16565329-7a86-4f94-a0fa-a8454c5cb30e -->

**RETURN**
When she walked through the gates of Kalsgard several days later, her arms numb from the linnorm’s claws and from dragging the beast’s heavy head behind her, she was surrounded by whispers of doubt and disbelief. The shock and confusion that started at the gate turned to shouts of cheating and witchcraft by the time she had reached the keep. She heard her siblings’ voices, Birgun Whale-Eater and Yngvilda the Bold, those who had squabbled for power when their father departed. By the time she arrived at the castle doors, one voice was loudest above all. Uldren Orcsbane, her eldest brother and the most ambitious of her siblings, who had always been among the first to discredit her.

# UNFINISHED BUSINESS
For years Thira’s father, Sveinn Blood-Eagle, plotted to strike out against the nation of Irrisen and reclaim the land Baba Yaga had taken from the linnorm kings. Knowing his years were growing short, Sveinn had recently been increasing his preparations, spurred on by news of the fall of the winter queen and the change in rulership. Yet Sveinn abandoned his plan and sailed across <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.644,t=0.303,r=0.873,b=0.495), with ID 592e760e-aca1-46b3-bffb-d1c6f30788b4 -->

# MISSING IN ACTION
Lictor Vidoc has pressed his agents to determine whether there are any survivors of the Order of the Coil in Vidrian who might be debriefed about that Order’s fate. The Order of the Scourge suspects that the Coil may have overstepped its bounds, and thus their interest is not to visit retribution on Vidrian’s revolutionaries. However, because of the Coil’s past abuses, Hellknights are unwelcome in Vidrian. Accordingly, Lictor Vidoc has been forced to work through intermediaries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.069,r=0.364,b=0.283), with ID e89459b4-1cc0-4e5f-8a0f-ee29f76a54cd -->

LEADER OF THE ORDER OF THE SCOURGE
LN MALE HUMAN HELLKNIGHT
The charming, capable Lictor Toulon Vidoc is the leader of the Hellknight Order of the Scourge, the oldest Hellknight order and the one perhaps most often at odds with Cheliax’s ruling houses. The Order of the Scourge is dedicated to apprehending criminals of every stripe, from street toughs and isolated serial killers to corrupt merchants and casually murderous aristocrats who use their positions to cover their crimes. In Cheliax, investigating the misdeeds of the powerful often ends poorly for the investigator, but Lictor Vidoc’s deft political maneuvering and the long list of nobles who owe him personal favors have given the Scourge Hellknights a relatively free hand to pursue their duties. Without the lictor’s influence, it is likely that the Order of the Scourge would have run afoul of House Thrune long ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.106,r=0.916,b=0.294), with ID 43d2a5ab-719a-4153-a21a-d984eb47a31c -->

Toulon Vidoc was born to a prosperous merchant family in Egorian. He joined the dottari as a youth, but as he was not of the nobility, his prospects for advancement were slim. Nevertheless, he applied himself energetically to the work, learning investigative techniques and developing the beginnings of an informant network that would serve him throughout his career. Whenever the young dottari encountered someone who took policing seriously, he applied himself to learning whatever he could from such masters, irrespective of their rank or background. This made him an anomaly in Egorian’s status-obsessed society, where one’s family name was often more important than one’s deeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.296,r=0.915,b=0.433), with ID 5156ae68-df21-4c48-bbda-1fb17c65fa3c -->

Vidoc left the dottari after two of his cases ended in frustration. In the first, he uncovered a nest of Skinsaw cultists who had been murdering slum dwellers in Egorian. He believed—and believes to this day—that Asmodean aristocrats used the cult killings to cover their own murders, which were attributed to the Skinsaw cult and the cases officially closed despite Vidoc’s protests. He still wonders who those Asmodeans were, and why his superiors were so adamant that the case be closed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.434,r=0.914,b=0.525), with ID 1a401bff-e95c-4b47-97ed-0058f2bb4325 -->

The second case struck closer to home. Vidoc’s parents were ruined when a ship in  
which they’d been heavily invested was seized by pirates in the Shackles. The cargo  
was lost along with all hands—an unusual level of savagery that tipped Vidoc off  
to the probability that the massacre was meant to cover something. Vidoc began  
investigating and soon determined that a competitor had deliberately betrayed  
the ship’s route and defenses to ensure that his own ship’s cargo would be  
the only one to arrive safely, thereby tripling his profits. However, the  
conspirators in the Shackles were no ordinary pirates but something  
far worse, and not remotely human.

Before Vidoc could finish his investigation, it was shut down unceremoniously. Egorian’s dottari had no authority to investigate anything in the Shackles. His personal interest, given the loss of his parents’ fortune, made his involvement suspect. And the Egorian merchant who had orchestrated the scheme died suddenly, under mysterious circumstances, leaving no culprit left to bring to justice in Cheliax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.463,t=0.663,r=0.913,b=0.755), with ID 03d89009-ab6b-4528-b9f0-96874d274e59 -->

# THE ROAD TO HELL
Frustrated, Vidoc left the dottari and joined the Order of the Scourge. Here, his lack of noble ancestry posed no obstacle, and he rose quickly through the ranks. Toulon Vidoc rapidly developed a reputation for precise thinking, dogged determination, and tremendous personal courage. His years navigating Egorian’s politics also left him far more adept at manipulating the levers of power than most Hellknights could ever be. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.767,r=0.913,b=0.891), with ID 52157e97-01be-4797-9d41-b6c2d7618314 -->

Within less than a decade, Vidoc rose from a rank-and-file Hellknight to lictor. He shaped the Hellknights under his command in his own image, constantly exhorting them to develop new policing strategies, build up informant <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.415,t=0.893,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID a7f5e4af-1d92-4bcc-a429-28cfd29ea8c7 -->

Summary : This is a network diagram or "conspiracy board" style illustration, showing a collection of hand-drawn character sketches and notes pinned to a wooden board, interconnected by red strings. The central image is a detailed drawing of a crowned or horned figure, with other sketches and notes radiating outward, each connected by multiple strings, suggesting relationships or links between the individuals or concepts depicted.

network diagram:
# Nodes :
  • Central node: Detailed sketch of a crowned or horned figure (center).
  • Peripheral nodes: Multiple hand-drawn character sketches and notes, each on separate pieces of paper, distributed around the central image.
  • Each node is represented by a pinned piece of paper, some with visible faces, others with only partial sketches or text.

# Relationships :
  • Red strings connect the central figure to nearly all peripheral nodes.
  • Many peripheral nodes are also interconnected with each other via red strings, forming a dense web.
  • The connections are undirected (no arrows), indicating associations rather than directional relationships.

# Layout :
  • The board is triptych-style, with three wooden panels (left, center, right) forming a semi-circular display.
  • The central figure is prominently placed in the middle panel.
  • Peripheral sketches and notes are distributed across all three panels, with some overlapping the panel edges.
  • The red strings crisscross the board, creating a visually complex network.

# Analysis :
  • The diagram visually emphasizes the centrality of the crowned/horned figure, suggesting this character is a key node in the network.
  • The dense interconnections among peripheral nodes indicate a web of relationships, alliances, or shared information.
  • The use of red string and pinned notes evokes investigative or conspiratorial themes, implying a search for connections or hidden truths among the depicted individuals.
  • The overall structure suggests a narrative or mystery involving multiple characters, with the central figure as the focal point. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.004,r=0.979,b=0.423), with ID fdff0f0f-707b-4ad3-9241-e1ee955f4aa9 -->

His career has been burnished by his Order’s successes. Five years ago, Vidoc secretly
captured the Bellflower Network’s previous leader, Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG
female halfling abolitionist). The hellspawn Hellknight **Jheraal** (LN female tiefling^APG
human hellknight) solved a series of unsettling murders in Westcrown, ultimately
tracing them to agents of the graveknight Order of the Crux. Master of Blades
**Uldrannas Haelcant** (LG male human hellknight) continues to pursue a 40-year-old
ring of necromantically influenced organ harvesters and kidnappers. Though he has
not succeeded in apprehending its ringleaders, he has greatly diminished its activity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.479,r=0.618,b=0.602), with ID 899f0824-a130-49a0-b1a6-722197f7a3e3 -->

The Order of the Scourge, under Lictor Vidoc’s guidance, has also taken a passing
interest in the disappearance of Absalom’s primarch, Lord **Gyr of Gixx** (N male
human rogue), and the appointment of Wynsal Starborn as acting primarch in Gyr’s
place. The Hellknights’ interest is to ensure that Absalom continues to run smoothly,
as the city-state is too important a trading power to be allowed to slip into chaos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.602,r=0.619,b=0.679), with ID 16f38cae-d662-4d97-83c1-60d0bdbcc7d8 -->

Vidoc’s accomplishments unsurprisingly drew the attention of Queen Abrogail II of Cheliax. While Vidoc had so far managed to maneuver around Abrogail’s interest in him—an interest he believes may have bordered on the romantic more so than the political—he recently earned her scrutiny due to Order of the Scourge’s investigation into the queen herself. The Order posits that Abrogail may have had a hand in Cheliax’s recent turmoil for political or financial gain. News of Abrogail’s attempts to hire Blood Mistress Jakalyn to dispatch the queen’s enemies, potentially including members of the Order of the Scourge, have only pushed this investigation to the Order’s highest priority. Vidoc has halted the investigation for the moment as he considers his strategy, but stirrings throughout the Order of the Scourge suggest that the Hellknights will not be daunted by Abrogail and the investigation will be moving forward. A conflict between these powers seems near inevitable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.679,r=0.619,b=0.864), with ID 4bdb2b21-05a4-425d-a77b-ec3ba88c9504 -->

# OLD FAVORS
A peculiarity of Toulon Vidoc’s early career was his lack of interest in claiming credit for his successes. It was the work itself that absorbed him, not the acclaim that followed. While Vidoc was quick to volunteer for the hardest cases, he was also happy to let other dottari claim credit for the apprehensions.

# ENTERTAINING THE MASSES
Watcher-Lord Ulthun personally vouched for all of his goblin retainers upon arriving in Absalom, resulting in a minor scandal among Absalom high society. Yet the scandal was so minor and amusing it has caused many residents of Absalom to view goblins as curiosities–which, while not ideal, is still better than as threats. It also gained Ulthun a cadre of curious and loyal Absalom goblin volunteers, though how helpful many of them are is debatable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.068,r=0.368,b=0.269), with ID 9594329b-b545-41d9-9cd9-8f9422794b4d -->

# ULTHUN II

WATCHER-LORD IN EXILE  
LG MALE HUMAN PALADIN  
The destruction of Lastwall sometimes reminds Ulthun of his family’s origins. His grandparents fled from the horrific violence of the priests of Zon-Kuthon in Nidal, arriving in Lastwall as refugees. They laid down roots in Vigil, and Ulthun was born there in 4690 AR. From an early age, Ulthun nurtured a passion for literature and history. But after forming a habit of defending other children from bullies, Ulthun grew certain that it was the duty of the powerful to protect the vulnerable. He then dedicated himself to becoming one of Lastwall’s crusaders and a paladin of Iomedae, the goddess of righteous valor, justice, and honor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.380,t=0.066,r=0.921,b=0.265), with ID 4537c9c0-2a33-4af7-988b-447889035553 -->

In 4709 AR, however, his plans were eclipsed. Though Ulthun was only 19, the Precentors Martial of Vigil’s War College elected him as the watcher-lord of Lastwall. Despite his youth, his tours of service in Belkzen proved Ulthun’s unparalleled commitment to the crusaders’ virtues. For the subsequent decade, Ulthun led his people with the backing of his advisors in the Precentors Martial.

The people of Lastwall celebrated Ulthun as a measured ruler dedicated to social advancement and vigilant defense of Lastwall’s borders. Though still a romantic at heart, Ulthun refrained from mingling with the suitors that flocked in Castle Overwatch’s courtyard to vie for his attention. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.380,t=0.264,r=0.919,b=0.405), with ID 39300f6d-2fa2-473a-8e1b-09d3d242e460 -->

During the tenth year of Ulthun’s rule, Lastwall faced a calamity. In 4719 AR, Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, broke free from his prison in Gallowspire. Craving vengeance against the nation that oversaw his imprisonment, Tar-Baphon detonated a shard of the Shield of Aroden in Vigil, vaporizing the capital city in an instant, then set his hordes of undead across the entirety of Lastwall. Ulthun fought valiantly alongside the crusaders that had once trained him, intending to die with his old comrades in accordance with the vows of self-sacrifice he had made to Iomedae over a decade past. But a group of humble goblins convinced Ulthun to stand down, begging for his help to save their tribe from the undead. Recognizing the goblins would die without someone to help them flee to safety and knowing that many knights would be too clouded by prejudice to offer assistance, the encounter reminded Ulthun that his greater duty was to his suffering people—no matter what form they took. Ulthun fled his collapsing nation with the goblins and his remaining knights at his side, vowing to one day return, bring an end to Tar-Baphon, and rebuild his home. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.457,t=0.406,r=0.917,b=0.723), with ID 1e21aa14-c37e-4f77-8c48-8af2c8eba161 -->

Almost a year has passed since the fall of Lastwall.
After months of journeying, the last watcher-lord arrived
in Absalom empty-handed, just as his grandparents had
once arrived in Lastwall. The government of Absalom
welcomed Ulthun with open arms, allowing Ulthun to
establish a makeshift embassy in the Precipice Quarter,
a neighborhood that had been nearly annihilated by an
earthquake. Ulthun now works to revitalize the Precipice
Quarter, building a community for refugees grieving the loss
of their home. With each passing week, more newcomers
arrive, all seeking to assist the survivors of Lastwall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.723,r=0.920,b=0.895), with ID 2b991a98-19f5-44d9-b55d-43f8adfd2c31 -->

The displaced ruler now gathers his strength in preparation  
for the reclamation of his nation. Ulthun provides shelter to  
other refugees, spins stories to win over new allies, and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.893,r=0.921,b=0.942), with ID 22a6d1c0-5ee8-4bca-9b0c-08771ea98236 -->

negotiates to secure the materials and transportation they’ll need for the coming
war. Yet, a surfeit of doubts and guilt lies underneath his efforts. Even as Ulthun
wonders if the fall of Lastwall grew out of his own shortcomings, he questions
whether he still holds enough faith in Iomedae’s pure ideals to see him through.
But, with each dawn, Ulthun pushes past his inner turmoil, as the return of Tar-
Baphon presents a threat far beyond such petty matters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.078,r=0.619,b=0.175), with ID dd905974-0c2d-427d-8d1d-bc8def184c8e -->

# LORD IN EXILE
Though Ulthun has done his best to remain a steady pillar in these trying times, his pain, frustration, and regret are not demons that can be banished by a sword. It is clear to most of his entourage that the watcher-lord has sublimated much of his frustration into reclaiming the Precipice Quarter, using what small victories he can claim as a balm for the defeats he’s suffered. Those knights closest to him worry about his psyche and health, especially after Ulthun uncovered and killed a manipulative undead creature known as a lovelorn that seemed to be drawn to him. While Ulthun tries to seek out help when the burden becomes too much, his status as a public figure in the eye of the world has left him sorely without confidants. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.182,r=0.619,b=0.341), with ID 80269694-b38c-468b-95c1-8c98f94f99df -->

The current acting primarch of Absalom, Wynsal Starborn, has proven a steadfast friend in these trying times. Both men have committed their lives to military service, and more importantly, Wynsal Starborn gave Ulthun and his people a home when they came to Absalom utterly destitute. Though Ulthun genuinely cares for his brother-in-arms, he also hopes that his relationship with Wynsal will pave the way for a long-term relationship with Absalom’s Grand Council. To this end, Ulthun actively wants Wynsal to remain the acting primarch or seek a full appointment as primarch of Absalom, even though he knows that Wynsal hopes to replace himself with a legitimate successor. Ironically, Wynsal seems to consider Ulthun II the ideal candidate for that replacement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.341,r=0.620,b=0.497), with ID f018cecf-598c-432f-b27d-4cc92cfee00e -->

# THE LONG PATH FORWARD
Ulthun devotes most of his time to mustering the strength needed to defeat Tar-Baphon. His efforts take a great number of forms, but three projects currently demand his attention in particular. Ulthun has heard of a group of survivors who have fled to the woods near Three Pines Ford. If the rumors are true, they are under the protection of the three dryad sisters that the town was named for. Ulthun is desperate to send agents to smuggle the survivors out of Three Pines Ford, and to secure the dryad sisters as allies against Tar-Baphon’s forces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.504,r=0.620,b=0.633), with ID ebb04016-b524-432b-85c9-c03b3134d402 -->

Ulthun also hopes to send a contingent of soldiers to the port city Vellumis, where priestess **Aylunna Varvatos** (LG female human cleric of Iomedae) is still orchestrating evacuations to Absalom alongside volunteers from the Magaambya. While she has done well to maintain Vellumis’s defensive perimeter, Ulthun hopes that, by bolstering her forces, Aylunna will be able to reclaim some of the surrounding territory from Tar-Baphon’s army. This would allow Lastwall’s forces to take the first steps toward establishing the forward bases and supply lines that they would need in the upcoming war. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.632,r=0.620,b=0.755), with ID 74c6c5d0-5afd-4460-aa89-d7c1f4dc3360 -->

In addition to rescuing his people, Ulthun is searching for powerful weapons to challenge Tar-Baphon’s arcane might. With that in mind, he has turned his gaze to the half-sunken ruins of Beldrin’s Bluff, which lie just off the coast of the Precipice Quarter. He plans to send a team of intrepid adventurers into the ruins to seek out an artifact of the legendary arcanist Beldrin, despite rumors of sea devils plundering Beldrin’s fallen tower. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.755,r=0.620,b=0.849), with ID 214f170e-57c9-4e14-9471-3faa8172f446 -->

# ULTHUN’S PROPAGANDA
Ulthun II currently serves as the locus of Lastwall’s recruitment campaign. While Ulthun remains in Absalom, telling what tales he can and glad-handing who he must to continue the flow of gold and supplies to the remains of Lastwall, the knights Kalabrynne and Clarethe lomedar serve on the front lines of the battle against the Whispering Tyrant. Kalabrynne oversees the training of recruits at Vellumis, one of the few remaining cities in the nation that still stands. She works closely with her child, Clarethe, whose boldness inspires recruits and veterans alike to decisive action. As a knight-reclaimant, Clarethe is eager to take the offensive in the war against Tar-Baphon and reclaim the ruins of Vigil, a brash move that perhaps fails to perceive how dire a threat Tar-Baphon <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.634,t=0.363,r=0.882,b=0.695), with ID 1433162a-8117-4a24-b991-544717b51fc8 -->

Ulthun is beginning to sympathize with

LINNORM KING OF THE IRONBOUND ISLANDS
CN FEMALE HUMAN BARBARIAN
Four fierce eyes survey the throne room of Halgrim, two belonging to a great crag linnorm and two belonging to an imposing woman seated in the center of a group of columns. Each column represents an island in her domain, the Ironbound Islands. Her royal regalia is cropped at the arms, revealing pale white skin and toned muscle. A powerful woman with white hair and pale blue eyes from her albinism, Estrid wears ornately decorated armor that covers her body thoroughly to protect her from the sunlight. Even her royal trappings are fashioned from thick leather, as she is perpetually ready to do battle. Her battle axe is always at her side, the hilt hewn from the dark rock of the Ironbound Islands. Banners around her hall depict sea creatures locked in combat with armored women. Claw motifs adorn her throne, as if when she presides over the hall, she does so from the fallen body of a great beast. This is the Linnorm King White Estrid, scoffed at by other Ulfen in her land, yet so far unchallenged in her rule. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.381,t=0.106,r=0.915,b=0.355), with ID c0a827cc-1b6c-4637-95e4-395a4336ce68 -->

As a young girl, Estrid joined a hearth with the
intention of training as a warrior. During her
time at the hearth, Estrid refined her skills
with the sword as well as in sailing. After
leading the fleet of longboats she sailed with
on a great raid on the port of Nisroch in 4704 AR,
Estrid broke through a blockade at the Arch of Aroden and ferried
the raided treasure directly into the harbor at Absalom, the City
at the Center of the World. Due to this and other exploits, Estrid
gained a reputation as daring in the face of danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.467,t=0.356,r=0.916,b=0.510), with ID 0b890172-b6ef-4e4d-acf1-22a4974f9275 -->

When tales of a crag linnorm taking up residence on one of the
islands struck the ears of her crew, Estrid was the first to call for
the anchor to be lifted, and the first to set off for the glory of the
ultimate prize: the head of a linnorm. After tracking the creature
to the mysterious Island of Ancestors, White Estrid battled
fiercely with the linnorm **Boiltongue** (CE male crag linnorm).
Yet in the final moments, instead of killing the monster, Estrid
accepted the beast’s plea to parlay and bound him to her service,
agreeing to take Boiltongue alive as her thrall. Estrid returned
to Halgrim to claim the title of linnorm king as her own, where
Boiltongue stands behind her throne, a living trophy and avatar
of her power. King Estrid also returned from the isle with a
powerful weapon, though she will not share anything of its
origin beyond that it was a gift from earth spirits that inhabit
the island, making the elders of Halgrim uneasy about who or
what Estrid is beholden to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.482,t=0.510,r=0.916,b=0.754), with ID 73b5e226-e162-4df4-a4b4-ca041fa7dfc9 -->

Despite her detractors, White Estrid is currently one of the
longest-established linnorm kings. She rules with ferocity, and
continually engages in military moves as well as diplomatic
ones. She encourages agrarian pursuits, and due to the
presence of Boiltongue, her farmlands are often the most
secure—to her critics’ chagrin. Estrid also encourages
groups outside of the Ulfen to settle in her lands. Her
subjects include orcs, half-orcs, and dwarves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.522,t=0.757,r=0.916,b=0.881), with ID 6a90dab4-98c8-498a-874b-4e317229f0d3 -->

in the Thanelands and Icemark have added a sense of tension to the lands. White Estrid is eager to use that tension to her advantage in building her armies, security, and wealth in the face of a changing world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.079,r=0.617,b=0.127), with ID 6a7e9736-e715-4628-8f71-dd9c33079ff9 -->

FRIEND TO THE PECULIAR  
Though in many ways she’s an ideal Ulfen warrior in her ambition and daring, White Estrid seems to enjoy finding others who upend expectations like herself. She has heard of Nankou and has attempted to contact him directly through diplomatic channels, but her attempts have revealed that he is often away from his throne—Estrid has had the most luck in reaching Nankou’s mother’s household, as the new linnorm king is most often found in the tundra of his kingdom rather than his throne room. She is impressed with his tenacity and is glad to see another king breaking with traditional Ulfen assumptions. Ever an astute ruler, White Estrid also sees a potential ally in Nankou and the kingdom of Icemark, especially if there is to be a fight with Belimarius to rally together for. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.138,r=0.616,b=0.310), with ID 6915d2bf-2fb4-4c69-9b0b-ed97a44f0e66 -->

Thira Ash-Eyes, who recently rose to power in the Thanelands, is a curiosity to White Estrid. King Estrid is intrigued by the fact that Thira was the one who claimed the throne of the most powerful linnorm king in the land, especially as she was not the expected successor to her father, **Sveinn Blood-Eagle** (CN male human barbarian). Estrid has not met with Thira Ash-Eyes yet, though she plans to contact the new linnorm king of Kalsgard with intentions of renewing the treaty between their kingdoms. Estrid is no fool, however—she is well aware of Thira’s unstated challenge toward her in deliberately seeking the same type of linnorm that Estrid vanquished, and then in emphasizing how Thira killed it with her own strength instead of taming it with a gift from the earth. Estrid is also unsure of how Thira came to be so powerful without attracting attention before, and she’s using diplomatic relations to dig further into Thira’s background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.311,r=0.616,b=0.494), with ID bd61aac9-7948-4844-848b-a76417f77d6e -->

Estrid and Boiltongue’s relationship remains enigmatic, though in public
the linnorm always shows silent deference. Estrid is never cruel to Boiltongue,
admiring the strength of the linnorm, but his subservience and his nickname of
“Estrid’s pet” are not kind to his pride. Boiltongue remains bitter at times about
the trade of his self-determination for his life, but he also acknowledges that
Estrid gained a potent strategic advantage in choosing to not strike him down.
The linnorm exists in a balancing act of resentment and respect that can easily
swing in either direction depending on the situation and Boiltongue’s mood, but
as the years have gone on and he has accepted his fate, the pendulum tends toward
respect. He is a great ally to the city of Halgrim, as well as the Ironbound Islands,
and roams it as a protector, a duty he even seems to enjoy providing. He speaks
little, unless the validity of Estrid’s claim is challenged—then he is quick to affirm
that she did best him in one-on-one combat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.495,r=0.615,b=0.693), with ID 6b3b31fd-4981-4489-85d8-21f98236d7a6 -->

Estrid considers the biggest threat to her kingdom to be Runelord Belimarius; the runelord’s defeat of Opir Eightfingers means that her hungry gaze can now turn to the Ironbound Islands. Estrid is wary of Belimarius’ ambition and has doubled the security around her person, as well as increased the number of longboat crews that venture into the Steaming Sea on patrol. Recognizing that the runelord is attempting to goad Estrid into brash action, the linnorm king has outmaneuvered these political traps, though she knows this may not remain effective for long. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.694,r=0.614,b=0.800), with ID cc5ab77d-f739-417c-81fc-2406d072625b -->

King Estrid is also keen on recruiting heroes to further explore the mysterious
Island of the Ancestors. To this end, she has reached out to the Pathfinders in
Iceferry Lodge, though she has proven enigmatic toward her goals or the potential
contents of the island. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.801,r=0.615,b=0.862), with ID 78640ddd-3aa0-440e-8ef0-7d3d0aa8551c -->

# BOILTONGUE’S TRAVELS
*As you know, Boiltongue leaves Halgrim once every year, typically after the harvest, only to return some days later.

_Legends_ assumes that Absalom’s army narrowly routed Tar-Baphon’s forces in the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path. Though the captain of the First Guard, Lord **Rothos of House Vastille** (LN male human fighter), fared better than countless other heroes, he was struck with so many wounds and curses that he was forced to retire.

# ACTING PRIMARCH OF ABSALOM
LG MALE HUMAN FIGHTER
To Chun Hye Seung, Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom:
    Greetings, my friend. Seeing your title written out in full at the top of a missive from the primarch must seem strange. I should know; it was the case when I served as captain, too. Congratulations on your promotion. It is well earned, and my only regret is that Rothos suffered so terribly at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant to create the vacancy you now occupy. He was a good soldier and an even better commander. His reports are certainly much better organized and insightful than mine ever were, so your time reading them will be time well spent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.106,r=0.915,b=0.264), with ID c43d749c-2a97-4779-8910-f9d2c790b1f0 -->

These are strange days, and this was brought most recently to my attention when I visited a new orphanage opening in Eastgate. It was the Hodley Manor! Over on the Stag Road, where I used to explore as a child. Someone bought the manor, it seems, and renovated it. I didn’t have the heart to tell them how all the neighborhood children considered it haunted back in our day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.265,r=0.914,b=0.341), with ID b15461b8-868e-4b31-ad4c-3fd3d806723c -->

I can already see your eyebrows coming together in suspicion and concern.
Wynsal Starborn, known for blunt forthrightness in decades of service to the
First Watch, meandering into an anecdote? Have the years he spent on the Grand
Council after his retirement instilled the tendency to circumlocution inherent in
all politicians? Has his appointment as Acting Primarch of Absalom, Acting Siege
Lord, Acting Protector of Kortos, and Acting Everything-Else-Lord-Gyr-Left-
Behind-When-He-Vanished eroded his sanity in the last four years? Not at all.
I just feel like I have few true confidants these days. The weight of managing
a chaotic and ancient and marvelous city such as ours is crushing, but I can’t
publicly show it. Some say I’ve seized power, or engineered a military coup, and
that I crave to drop the “Acting” from my title of “Acting Primarch.” But you
know better, that I’m driven by duty and not desire. If Lord Gyr came back today,
I’d be toasting his health in the Little Roofs with my old comrades tonight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.342,r=0.914,b=0.540), with ID 5c6bf036-f3f8-488a-acef-56f12c51eb87 -->

I’m not giving up hope of finding him, or of finding another worthy successor to be primarch. Have you met Watcher-Lord Ulthun II from Lastwall? Seeing a beloved nation destroyed is the greatest burden I can imagine, and he’s held up through it all. He’s a paragon of resolve. If the Whispering Tyrant is to be the burden of our age, I sometimes think Ulthun should be the primarch to face him. Yet Ulthun has already lost so much to the Whispering Tyrant that perhaps that would be another cruelty heaped upon the pile. I can only hope that Ulthun has confidants in his troubles, and is right this moment penning a letter to a friend, like this one I’m writing to you, sharing his worries and weariness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.388,t=0.542,r=0.913,b=0.677), with ID 616f96f6-5264-41d5-a143-0ec0f5b5f310 -->

I’m far too old now to be naive, but I remain an idealist. Leaders with nobility and a sense of purpose bring out the best in those they lead. My enemies are many, from invaders jealous of Absalom’s wealth to career politicians who crave more power (and, frankly, the latter are far more dangerous than the former). These enemies all have one thing in common: they believe rule by force is superior to rule by example. They are wrong. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.398,t=0.678,r=0.914,b=0.770), with ID 400a1eca-8abe-46cd-944f-2d391a7e998e -->

In your new leadership role, that is probably my most critical advice. Oh, and stay away from Hodley Manor. Just in case.

To Chun Hye Seung, Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom:
    Greetings, my friend, though I fear I write to you in the spirit of business rather than companionship. Beside me sits an urgent missive from Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid, warning me of a gnoll slaver and fugitive named Shimon-Je who is running one step ahead of the law. He believes she is traveling to Absalom and has asked us to capture Shimon-Je and return her to Katapesh to face judgment. It’s well within his rights to ask, and a task I am eager to perform. You know my <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.831,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID 1405a041-10c3-4dfe-8995-528b7884f559 -->

opinions on slavery well by this point, and I am certain you will assign

There are rumors that slavery may soon fall out of favor in Katapesh. Perhaps they are just rumors, but they give me hope. The fires of abolition seem to be catching. I’m proud of my part in that, and what I’ve done for Absalom. Manumitting all the slaves was the only way this city repelled the Fiendflesh Siege three years ago. There is already a lot of ink spilled about the heroics of the Pathfinder Society, the power of the city’s mages leaping to its defense, and the siege weapons you designed and built (and, frankly, cosseted!) in your former role as First Siege Gear. All these helped break the siege, but all of them would have failed if we didn’t have the former slaves doing the backbreaking work of defense. They were doing it for themselves, for their own city, and not out of fear of a master’s lash. That made all the difference, I believe. The proudest I have ever been of the Grand Council was when they declared slavery and the slave trade illegal throughout Absalom only a few weeks after my order of manumission. It goes to show that sometimes the best in anyone—or any group—comes not by ham-handed force, but by the independence to reach for great things. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.113,r=0.585,b=0.417), with ID 657be19b-a94d-4729-864e-1778dfd5f3f0 -->

In that same vein, I am pleased to say Avarneus from Vidrian has reached out to me again, with questions of diplomatic support. I am happy to give it. Although I consider revolutionaries dangerous, I understand that Vidrian is building something empowering from the ruins of something tyrannical. I support that. Perhaps I ought to introduce Avarneus to Andira Marusek on Andoran’s People’s Council. Certainly, the two have a common enemy in Abrogail Thrune, and keeping Cheliax in check benefits Absalom. Ah, but that’s mercenary of me. These days it seems I can’t help but think like that. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.418,r=0.617,b=0.541), with ID 6e415aa7-a60e-4d71-a261-ead73403a0f7 -->

With regard to your report on the Spire of Nex, I’ve received confirmation from Venture-Captain Shevala Iorae that she and the Pathfinder Society are willing to fully cooperate with your efforts. Shevala especially should be a boon, as I doubt there are any who know more about that tower than Nex himself. Though I know better than to tell you how to do your duties for you, permit me to caution all of you to be careful, for my own peace of mind. You and I have stared down a number of sieges in recent years, but seeing the Spire so close in everyday life seems to have a pronounced effect on my worries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.541,r=0.617,b=0.664), with ID 2729636a-84fe-4e0a-9750-a99407e716e9 -->

Finally, to your vindication, I must at last concede to your concerns over Lictor Toulon Vidoc. I felt I had nothing to fear from his investigations—I have no political skeletons for him to ferret out from beneath my bed. But you were correct that someone has been feeding him bad evidence, even insisting that I might have had involvement in Lord Gyr’s disappearance! Yet though I understand your personal stake in the matter, I reiterate that the First Guard fights Absalom’s external enemies, not its internal ones. It is a heavy chain to wear, and one I knew well in my many years of service, but you must wear it. We both have our own battlefields, and you have foes enough on yours to deal with. I will handle mine.

# EVERYTHING IS POLITICS
Wynsal’s political situation is a complex one, fitting for a city as complex as Absalom. His initial appointment was to the emergency position of siege lord, when the true primarch of Absalom was found to be missing during an assault on the city known as the Fiendflesh Siege. Wynsal was then declared acting primarch until an official replacement for the position could be found. While Wynsal is happy to cede his position to a legitimately chosen successor, his impeccable character and effective governance have led many to voice their support for Wynsal being appointed to the primarchy in truth. This popularity, especially among Wynsal’s former underlings in Absalom’s military forces, has caused other political hopefuls to see Wynsal as a threat to their ambitions, and rumors have been spread by the nobility that Wynsal is intending a military coup. That Wynsal has been retired from the military and serving as a politician for over a decade hardly matters, as matters of truth rarely do in politics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.634,t=0.408,r=0.881,b=0.867), with ID ea52f4db-08ed-49fc-8dae-ffb19dce54e6 -->

I did not hear what the genie-binder said
to the shahiyan, and certainly could not
describe the look of wrath that fell over her
face. You would not believe the insults the
woman could craft, nor the speed at which
she could conjure them! The merchant
looked to her husband for help, but the

Please convey this gift to our bellicose friends in Canal Row. They will be concerned to learn of the Satrapian Guard exercises near Delenah, no doubt. A show of force would prove that Taldor’s recent internal troubles have not weakened the empire’s resolve. Once knowledge of the provocations in Golsifar becomes widespread, the Senate will have no choice but to take military action. Qadira will react in kind.

SATRAP OF QADIRA  
N MALE HUMAN ARISTOCRAT  
The province of Qadira is the frontier of perhaps the largest empire in the world, but early in his training to become satrap, a young Xerystes realized that the imperial bureaucrats of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh had forgotten what a frontier is. Qadira is forever surrounded by threats, forever far from imperial aid, and forever waiting for Taldor to resume its millennia-long habit of conquering its neighbors. Despite the comfort of his upbringing in the Qahir Palace of Katheer, Xerystes never lost sight of the fact that life on the frontier meant danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.400,r=0.915,b=0.540), with ID 9d6e0052-7b35-4432-94a5-d0bc58912ec7 -->

Today, the tall, bronze-skinned satrap believes that he could end that danger permanently, and earn a place for himself in history, by executing a decisive invasion of Taldor. Unfortunately for Xerbystes’s plans of conquest, the Padishah Emperor has expressly forbidden military intervention in Taldor, instead directing Vizier Hebizid Vraj to strengthen ties with Grand Princess Eutropia’s new regime. Though he does have a grudging respect for Eutropia’s resourcefulness in claiming the throne, Xerbystes deeply resents the meddling from the distant capital. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.541,r=0.914,b=0.647), with ID b1407c43-af91-4430-a886-e37e98640e21 -->

This interference is not the only example in Xerbystes’s life on the emperor’s long leash. Under threat of removal from his position, the long-time bachelor has taken a distant member of the imperial family, Deena al-Parishat, for a wife. Deena is a shahiyan, or a member of the royal family too far removed from the throne to have a more specific title. Though initially suspicious of Deena, the satrap has become intrigued by his passionate spouse, and many wonder if the new shahiyan will soon sway her husband into banning the practice of keeping mortal slaves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.648,r=0.913,b=0.754), with ID 331d46f1-6819-44e0-96e1-e85d67005c50 -->

While publicly Xerbystes can do little more than review the Satrapian Guard and complain about Taldan aggression, he continues to fund covert operations to heighten tensions along Qadira’s northern border, hoping to goad Taldor into military action that might spiral into all-out war. Not daring to send the Peerless, his personal entourage of heroes who are all closely watched by his vizier, Xerbystes relies on dupes within Taldor or independent operators to accomplish his goals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.755,r=0.913,b=0.846), with ID 9a24961b-5e6d-4203-b3d7-cd2575021bad -->

With much of the country’s military force tied up in preparation for eventual war, Xerystes prefers to contract with mercenaries or adventurers to address domestic troubles. Recent reports of qlippoth in the Maharev Jungle, sinister cultists off the Emerald Coast, and a fiendish infestation in the Meraz Desert have caused him to put out a call for adventurers willing to hazard danger in exchange for Keleshite gold. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.388,t=0.847,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID fd73647c-8cfe-4f6f-89c2-2916ed2400b8 -->

A Diplomatic Communiqué  
To Her Imperial Majesty, Grand Princess Eutropia of Taldor,  
   I would like to extend a personal apology on behalf of Emperor Kalish XXII for the recent unpleasantness involving Trestarin Vain of Daggermark. The Qadiran coins found on his person are a transparent attempt by outsiders to reignite conflict that would weaken both of our empires. Still, we will redouble the efforts to remind citizens of our western-most satrapy that peace is mutually beneficial and mutually profitable.  
   Speaking of which, I have enclosed draft proposals for a number of trade agreements. I trust you to guide them through the labyrinth of your Senate. Exchange of lumber and spice will do more to bind the wounds of our nations than any peace treaties or imperial edicts.

HEBIZID VRAJ

VIZIER OF QADIRA
NG MALE HUMAN INVESTIGATOR
Many Kelesh diplomats would find assignment to Katheer to be a hardship post, but Hebizid Vraj relishes his position as vizier of the empire’s most isolated satrapy. Far from the imperial court, the canny Vraj enjoys almost complete autonomy. While dealing with the constant resentment of Satrap Xerbystes II is unpleasant in the extreme, the energetic vizier focuses his efforts on making the best of his situation. To Vraj, Qadira is the bridge between the Inner Sea region and the Kelesh Empire, and the best of both regions should be brought together in Katheer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.290,r=0.620,b=0.464), with ID 915e0b96-8496-4558-a8b3-94dc5eb059e6 -->

Much to the chagrin of Qadira’s satrap, the Padishah Empire long ago traded
military domination for economic, and much of Vraj’s time is concerned with
tending to the empire’s extensive web of trade agreements. Whether dealing
with Hashim ibn Sayyid as the chosen agent of Katapesh’s Pactmasters
or coaxing Taldan merchants to set aside ancient prejudices, the vizier is
a shrewd bargainer. Employing a vast network of intelligence agents, Vraj
ensures that he knows his partners’ positions as well as his own and leverages
that information to accomplish what he sees as best for the empire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.464,r=0.585,b=0.587), with ID 9f336cd5-12ec-4482-95ad-1063e44394f1 -->

Though international relations are Vraj’s primary focus, the vizier pursues opportunities to improve life for the average Qadiran. Vraj is a patron of the arts and sciences in Katheer and, in his small amount of free time, he enjoys attending lectures at the Planar Institute and the Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery. Though his efforts are currently secret, the vizier is zealously attempting to entice the great Rahadoumi healer, Kassi Aziril, to tone down her outspoken atheism enough to join the teaching staff at the Venicaan College, promising not only a substantial salary but also protection from any complications that immigration to Qadira might bring. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.587,r=0.585,b=0.725), with ID 40382241-442d-41c5-80d5-9f7f497d4108 -->

Many other projects within the country attract portions of Vraj’s attention: he frequently seeks experienced explorers to accompany military patrols to ruins in the Meraz Desert and Zho Mountains; he gathers reports of missing persons and property for investigation by the military or independent contractors; and he recruits skilled engineers and craftspeople to complete complex public works. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.725,r=0.555,b=0.816), with ID 91dac181-8658-4066-b002-41130ecfaf0c -->

A Perfumed Letter, Sent to the Imperial Capital  
_Dearest Cousin,_  
   _I must tell you, Layilah, that while Katheer is a bit of a backwater, it is not without its pleasures. The Qahir Palace would seem cramped by your standards, but it is well furnished, and the mosaic work would not be out of place at home. The satrap keeps one of the finest stables in the province, and he is an accomplished rider himself. As you know, our marriage was no love match, but I am pleased to share that interest with him._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.141,r=0.915,b=0.263), with ID 9b13a23e-b13d-4a1f-b050-632ef9950664 -->

You would not believe the horses, Laylah! Gray as mist and swift-footed as the wind, or shimmering gold and able to keep a rider warm through the coldest night on the sands. Some say the horses were a gift from genies long ago, and I believe it.
   The genie-touched horses here are my chief joy, but they also remind me of my chief sorrow. I know only vague rumors of the practice have reached the capital, but I cannot walk through the Grand Souk without seeing an efreeti bound in iron chains or some conjurer with his “pet” marid. Many of the nobles and merchants here keep human or halfling slaves, and slave markets operate openly in the city! It makes my blood boil. I have freed all of the palace slaves and established salaries for them, but there is much more to do. In fact, I must cut this letter short to meet with an advisor and one of the palace wizards. All of my best to you and your mother. Write me soon,

DEENA AL-GHARLA ANTIM ZHAR AL-PARISHAT

SHAHIYAN OF QADIRA
N FEMALE HUMAN ARISTOCRAT
Most people’s first impression of Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat is the snap of a cloak and the thunder of hooves as she rushes through the pre-dawn streets of Katheer on the way to her morning ride through the city’s outskirts. Those lucky enough to earn an audience with her speak of her frank nature and calm self-assurance. An athletic woman with warm bronze skin and copper highlights in her dark hair, al-Parishat’s appearance marks her origins in central Kelesh, and, indeed, she is a recent immigrant to Qadira, having traveled from the capital of the Padishah Empire for an arranged marriage with Satrap Xerystes II. The people of Qadira have generally welcomed the newcomer, hoping that the long-awaited end to Xerystes’s bachelorhood will settle questions of succession in the satrapy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.476,r=0.915,b=0.692), with ID 04dce7ba-0836-42bf-80da-e1504d0af957 -->

Despite the warm reception offered her, Shahiyan Deena is a polarizing figure. Her outspoken abolitionist stances have impressed the country’s slaves and Sarenites as much as they have discomfited Qadiran traditionalists. At least for the moment, Xerbystes seems unconcerned by her habit of upbraiding genie binders in the streets, a fact that has endeared her new husband to her. The two also share a mutual fondness for her distant cousin **Layilah** (NG female human priestess of Sarenrae), who both believe would be an excellent candidate for heir to the Kelesh imperial throne. While she is still far from trusting her husband with her heart, or the extent of her plans about reforming Qadira, the shahiyan has found Xerbystes to be more than the warmonger she had resigned herself to marrying. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.694,r=0.914,b=0.846), with ID 84f7640b-b6e2-4de3-853e-8cbd8cf4fd09 -->

Al-Parishat has discussed some of her plans with Vizier Hebizid Vraj, who shares many of her imperial Keleshite sensibilities. On his advice, the shahiyan is cultivating allies at the Planar Institute in Katheer and recruiting agents to investigate rumors of geniekin communities in the Zho Mountains. What the vizier does not know is that she is actively seeking to make contact with the Bellflower Network, and hopes to fund clandestine efforts to undermine the Qadiran slave trade, particularly in Sedeq. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.848,r=0.913,b=0.939), with ID b7b38834-fabc-4ae3-a92c-3590ca562dc4 -->

GENIE-TOUCHED COMPANIONS (RARE)
Xerystes II has had his palace spellcasters work to develop ways to replicate the great powers of the genie-touched horses of Qadira. These spellcasters have a rudimentary method in place that can grant such power to any animal companion, infusing them with elemental power and granting them otherworldly insight. Xerystes will sometimes gift these companions as a favor to others or have his spellcasters infuse the companions of trusted allies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.074,r=0.618,b=0.189), with ID bb9f6c07-e18c-490c-887c-efe4a828273a -->

If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have a savage or nimble animal companion, you can instead choose to for it to become a genie-touched companion. When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion. The genies and their elemental traits are as follows: djinni (air), efreeti (fire), marid (water), or shaitan (earth). A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie’s elemental trait.

Genie-touched companions can choose from the following options when they become specialized animal companions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.189,r=0.618,b=0.435), with ID 69ee5b12-b403-43e1-8be3-721bf5574fb6 -->

Deep Diver  
Your companion gains a swim Speed of 30 feet or a +10-foot status bonus to its existing swim Speed and can breathe underwater if it couldn’t already. Its Constitution modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank for Athletics increases to master and for barding increases to expert. This specialization can only be selected by marid-touched companions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.444,r=0.515,b=0.559), with ID 94028bd7-5805-4b1b-9a59-8f82e5cc692b -->

Steadfast Strider  
Your companion ignores natural difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from sediment or stone and can move across quicksand, mud, and similar surfaces as if they were solid. It gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws and DCs to prevent being Shoved or Tripped. Its Strength modifier increases by 1 and its proficiency for barding increases to expert. This specialization can only be selected by shaitan-touched companions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.567,r=0.539,b=0.697), with ID 0537cf29-e8b3-4e36-894a-19cd8ffa52bb -->

Wildfire Scorcher  
Your companion gains resistance to fire equal to your level. Any creature that attempts to Grapple or Grab your companion, hits your companion with a melee unarmed attack, or hits your companion with a melee weapon Strike while adjacent to your companion takes 2d6 fire damage. Its Dexterity modifier increases by 1 and its proficiency rank increases to legendary for Reflex saves and to expert for unarmored defense. This specialization can only be selected by efreeti-touched companions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.705,r=0.603,b=0.834), with ID 19ea2b66-aae0-4d1f-bd57-c10c09272e4e -->

Its proficiency rank increases to legendary for Reflex saves and to expert for unarmored defense. This specialization can only be selected by djinni-touched companions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.842,r=0.568,b=0.943), with ID 93551541-2008-4348-811a-549e7ecd08bb -->

# THE FIGHT FOR ABOLITION

Recent victories like **Wynsal Starborn**’s ban on slavery and the revolution spearheaded by rebels such as **Avarneus** and **Shimali Manux** have emboldened abolitionists around the Inner Sea region, such as Shahiyan **Deena al-Parishat**, who might be backed by her husband Satrap **Xerbytes II**. **Andira Marusek** has been preying on slaver ships from ports overseen by **Hashim ibn Sayyid**. In return, Hashim has been sending aid to Queen **Abrogail Thrune II**. The queen has also been enslaving refugees from **Tar-Baphon** and has ordered the deaths of Farmers **Magdelena and Martum Fallows**, who work with Andira to help slaves escape. The two Farmers are unwittingly compromised, as a previous Farmer was captured by Lictor **Toulon Vidoc**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.126,t=0.580,r=0.385,b=0.927), with ID ddd52f19-8d22-43af-9ffa-0e12e9fff035 -->

# HUNT FOR THE PRIMARCH

The primarch of Absalom mysteriously vanished several years ago, forcing the ruling councils to appoint Wynsal Starborn as acting primarch until a new primarch can be elected. Wynsal would like to see the exiled Watcher-Lord Ulthun II elected to the role to help Absalom fight against Tar-Baphon, who sieged Absalom once before, and to ensure Absalom remains independent—as other candidates for the primarchy, such as those loyal to Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian, would prefer to see Absalom annexed into another nation. To add to Absalom’s problems, Lictor Toulon Vidoc of the Hellknights has been fed bad evidence that Wynsal was the one who disposed of the rightful primarch, and the Order of the Scourge is now determined to investigate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.072,r=0.518,b=0.282), with ID 27c62c41-8e6e-4fb1-8078-9942398c5f46 -->

# MOTHER OF MEDICINE
Kassi Aziril, a Rahadoumi student of the legendary alchemist Artokus Kirran, has been making many breakthroughs in the field of non-magical healing, with the help of a few favors from Katapesh’s pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid. Kassi’s work has attracted attention from High King Anong Arunak, whose homeland lies in a magic-dead zone, and Grand Vizier Hebizid Vraj, who wishes Qadira’s medical schools to provide the best training possible. Kassi’s outspoken atheist beliefs have alienated many, however, and Queen Abrogail Thrune II even hired the Red Mantis assassins to murder the doctor, only to be shocked when Blood Mistress Jakalyn voided the contract. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.101,t=0.323,r=0.437,b=0.561), with ID c3d9799a-82bd-4382-9e3d-15beedac72ab -->

WAR IN THE NORTH  
Chancellor Irahai, the new leader of Mendev, aims to retake the land of the Sarkoris Scar, aided by legendary heroes such as Irabeth Tirabade and volunteers sent from the Magaambya by Janatimo. She recently received a sword from the Numerian warlord Kevoth-Kul but is uncertain whether it is a sign of alliance or a declaration of war. If Irahai investigates further, she might discover that one of Kevoth-Kul’s supposed allies, Khismar Crookchar, is illicitly sending agents to plunder the treasure of Choral the Conqueror that has been mysteriously washing up on Mendev’s shores. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.099,t=0.688,r=0.444,b=0.897), with ID 7daa07fe-9889-4877-adea-b68738bfd203 -->
