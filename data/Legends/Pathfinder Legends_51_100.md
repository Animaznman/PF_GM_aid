# DECEIVING THE DECEIVERS
Hashim is not the only prominent figure in Katapesh who is not as they appear. The Pactmasters are in fact enigmatic aliens known as witchwyrds (*Pathfinder Bestiary 2* 294) who have been ruling Katapesh for centuries. While Hashim’s usurpation by Olordaera went unnoticed, the Pactmasters are beginning to suspect something strange is afoot, though they are not yet sure what that may be. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.070,r=0.362,b=0.252), with ID c94e6ba1-feab-40a5-a932-02da5ed9272b -->

PACTBROKER OF KATAPESH  
LE GENDERLESS VIDILETH INFILTRATOR  
Within his extravagant chambers above the streets of Katapesh, Hashim sat comfortably in the lavish trappings provided him by the position of Pactbroker. A breeze wafted through the outside patio doors, thrown open and overlooking the busy merchant stalls below. Taking in the abundance of fine food and drink set before him, Hashim brought a jeweled goblet to his nose, and then his true self remembered two things—that it had a very important meeting to attend to, and that it could not bear the scent of wine. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.106,r=0.917,b=0.249), with ID 8c4a7f50-ff9a-4d33-a651-d0de916a7fe1 -->

Dumping the drink in his chamber pot far away from him, he returned to face the open air, took a moment to ensure his magical protections were in place, sat in a meditative stance, and closed his eyes. He opened its mind, and the voices came. One from Magnimar, one from the Darklands, and another from Rahadoum. The voices of its fellow veiled masters. Through the shared linking of their minds, they got right to the point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.249,r=0.915,b=0.341), with ID c98bb725-f75f-41c3-b42c-ca9bace3620a -->

“Olordaera,” asked Yuildoroc, its equal in Rahadoum. “What pact have you brokered with the alchemist Kassi Aziril behind my back, helping her heal the flesh of mortals without magic?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.342,r=0.915,b=0.387), with ID 0bc2c07c-631d-46c4-a1f8-26cb54e1b815 -->

“One that benefits us both, I assure you,” Olordaera replied. “Having such talent promote the anti-deific rhetoric of the Laws of Mortality only yields more subjects willing to turn to us instead of the gods. I provided her an ingredient that only we can harvest, in the depths of the Sightless Sea.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.388,r=0.914,b=0.448), with ID dac5f607-3830-4b5c-96a2-aab61fcd44fb -->

“A favor you should not soon forget,” said Uruluura, interjecting from its domain of Orv in the Darklands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.449,r=0.913,b=0.479), with ID 41efefeb-741b-4847-9f0f-3b5f164144f0 -->

“And what of your folly, Olordaera? What of Shimon-Je?” This was Thulgroon, in Magnimar. Independently of Olordaera’s thoughts, Hashim’s face clenched in aggravation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.480,r=0.912,b=0.524), with ID e32a8535-69c1-4fd0-8247-3cb788057eed -->

“The gnoll will be tracked down and disposed of,” Olordaera said.  
“She is despised in Katapesh, and I have ensured she will find no  
allies elsewhere. With my agents on her trail, our secret will be safe.”  
A sudden cacophony of voices rose, powerful and loud, and the  
alghollthu mentally present all withdrew a step inward. Hashim’s  
nose began to bleed. It was the Mhalssthru: the confluence of minds  
that ruled over and led their kind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.525,r=0.913,b=0.631), with ID 97f62866-2d35-4fda-8c00-81f476c02f96 -->

“It is *your* secret that you risk, Olordaera,” they said, echoing. “If your plan fails, you will be expunged. Our greater influence must not be discovered.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.633,r=0.912,b=0.663), with ID cf582a4c-cdac-476b-a1ab-03268bd3f5b5 -->

Just as quickly as it arrived, the mass of voices receded. For a moment, all Olordaera could sense was the fresh pulse of its now-empty mind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.661,r=0.913,b=0.693), with ID 2d277b50-3826-4c9f-aab2-7c22d7ba79ac -->

Hashim’s eyes fluttered open. He stood, wiped his nose with a handkerchief of imported Tian silk, then turned to the work of putting his plans in motion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.421,t=0.694,r=0.913,b=0.725), with ID 081b4744-9d99-45f5-b7fe-f5a0f5e4c049 -->

# DEPTHS OF HISTORY
Though the unseen and mysterious Pactmasters rule over Katapesh, they leave the enforcement of their decisions and mundane government up to a single appointed Pactbroker. The most recent Pactbroker to be appointed was Hashim ibn Sayyid, a human chosen for his mercantile skill and willingness to uphold the Pactmasters’ judgments. Weeks after his acceptance to the post, Hashim ibn Sayyid was murdered and replaced. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.391,t=0.738,r=0.913,b=0.845), with ID 775f1fda-1457-4d79-b52c-4ee00e95ec04 -->

The new Hashim is a vidileth—a veiled master—one of the sinister alghollthus.
These ancient aquatic beings have meddled in the fate of countless mortals,
even warping them into entirely new creatures. They were also the architects of
Earthfall, and to this day consider themselves superior to all others, including
deities. In their unending desire for control over other species, the alghollthus of
Golarion currently have multiple plans in motion. Some, like Olordaera, have <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.847,r=0.912,b=0.938), with ID 4f223fc8-569d-4ade-9600-6201d0ef0912 -->

chosen to take the personas of influential figures of power through shapeshifting, while others have turned to fleshwarping experiments to create more pliable servants, and some pursue secret plots they keep even from each other. Not all veiled masters work together, but they all watch one another, ensuring that their schemes do not threaten to reveal their existence to the world at large. If the plans of an individual veiled master seem doomed to fail in this way, the liability is annihilated. This measure has been enacted twice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.078,r=0.618,b=0.188), with ID 058eee2b-3d53-44b2-9143-7ac3eff538a4 -->

There is a series of four edicts that all alghollthu can recall from within their shared memory. The First Dictum is that life exists to be controlled. The Second Dictum is that to be an alghollthu is to control. The Third Dictum is that alghollthus are eternal as many and one. The Fourth and Final Dictum is that to overreach is to threaten the eternal. It is this last dictum that Olordarea is in danger of breaking; its true identity has been discovered by a gnoll named **Shimon-Je** (NG female gnoll abolitionist), who has thus far evaded capture on multiple counts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.188,r=0.617,b=0.297), with ID 8f29dc65-18e5-428c-9443-2f63b032e67b -->

MAKING WAVES  
An abolitionist gnoll and cleric of Sivanah jailed several times for disrupting Katapesh’s slave trade, Shimon-Je has repeatedly escaped permanent incarceration for her efforts. She became a true threat when she accidentally learned of the original Hashim’s death, confirming the ruse using a *true seeing* spell. Rumors suggest she has been attempting to make contact with Andira Marusek and her Gray Corsairs of Andoran. Hashim reached out to the interplanar bounty hunter Qiloc (LE female xill ranger) to hunt the gnoll down and has controlled the story outside of Katapesh well enough to convince Wynsal Starborn of Absalom that the gnoll is actually a fugitive slaver. With the Pactbroker’s resources allied against her, it seems only a matter of time before Shimon-Je is silenced. For anything else to happen would be catastrophic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.307,r=0.616,b=0.494), with ID d7ccb00b-c26f-4831-93db-21d4203073c4 -->

To the rest of the world, Hashim appears to be conducting business as usual,
even as he secretly pursues the alghollthu agenda. With the Grey Corsairs engaged
in the fight against slavery right on Hashim’s doorstep, he has officially requested
Wynsal Starborn’s help in removing them, yet these requests are seemingly falling
on deaf ears, regardless of which trade accords are threatened or brought to bear.
Hashim has publicly resigned himself to the Gray Corsairs’ attacks but has begun
to privately—and deniably—funnel more than a few potent weapons to Andira’s
rival, Queen Abrogail Thrune II of Cheliax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.494,r=0.616,b=0.617), with ID 855f10f5-7d2f-4335-9c26-5bed7c447b15 -->

Word of Nex’s potential return has led Hashim to contact High King Anong Arunak of Dongun Hold, requesting a trade agreement for firearms. If the war between Geb and Nex spreads to other nations, firearms will be crucial for defense. And should Geb and Nex destroy each other, there will be two countries directly south of Katapesh ripe for the taking. Hashim also keeps an eye on Kassi Aziril, to whom he granted a secret ingredient to bolster her medical advances; while he has so far passively supported her to encourage the spread of Rahadoum’s anti-theistic beliefs, he expects to collect on that debt when it would be most useful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.617,r=0.616,b=0.739), with ID 5614681c-324d-4497-91aa-910dca490ca6 -->

Hashim has also used his influence over the city to lay the lines of a mental focus known as a telepathic mesh repeater under the streets of Katapesh and begin a secret coup against the Pactmasters. Once it is active, the range of his mental domination would increase exponentially; he could solidify his rule of the region and potentially reach his mind beyond worlds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.740,r=0.615,b=0.818), with ID ad69ec52-f202-44e5-811c-c2bf331f1fbe -->

By any method or means, it’s time to make his move. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.102,t=0.817,r=0.447,b=0.831), with ID 081516fd-8453-433f-8ecc-fb7019f281c7 -->

# Irabeth Tirabade

## RENOWNED HEROINE OF THE WORLDWOUND

LG FEMALE HALF-ORC PALADIN  
One of the greatest heroes of the Fifth Mendevian Crusade is the half-orc Irabeth Tirabade, paladin of Iomedae, former knight of the Eagle Watch, and onetime ruler of Drezen. After a storied career in the final crusade of Queen **Galfrey** (LG female herald of Iomedae) to close the Worldwound, Irabeth retired with her wife **Anevia Tirabade** (NG female human rogue) to rural Mendev, where they rebuilt a modest home on her parents’ old farmstead a few days’ ride east of Kenabres. There, life had been comfortable—but Irabeth remained plagued by a nagging guilt that she had abdicated her duty and now works actively for the benefit of the people trying to reclaim the demon-scarred north. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.378,t=0.065,r=0.918,b=0.282), with ID 682b0943-7b3e-4041-8953-3511b804bee0 -->

# BORN OF TWO WORLDS
Irabeth Tirabade was born to loving, affectionate, and protective parents who instilled a strong sense of self-worth in their daughter from a young age, as they knew that a half-orc child would face more than her share of headwinds in life. Retired crusaders themselves, they also passed their faith in Iomedae down to their daughter. Thus was Irabeth’s life shaped by two strong forces: a fierce sense of self-respect and a deep, reverent righteousness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.289,r=0.918,b=0.403), with ID 065867b3-9d97-463a-8079-319c03189753 -->

Irabeth spent her early life trying to find her place in the world.
She went first to Lastwall, but the Lastwall’s knights’ long and
bitter wars against the orcs of Belkzen fostered an abiding antipathy toward
anyone of orcish descent. As a result, Irabeth found neither friendship
nor professional advancement, purely due to her parentage, and
she left disheartened. This youthful disillusion was traumatic and
lasting: even today, with Lastwall fractured and desperate after the
Whispering Tyrant’s rise and more sympathetic leaders
such as Kalabrynne Iomedar heading day-to-
day operations, Irabeth hesitates to return to
them. There are other causes and needs in the
world that call out for Irabeth’s heroism. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.424,t=0.401,r=0.916,b=0.585), with ID ec8b9dec-7f87-4aaf-ad1c-2983b89cf287 -->

After leaving Lastwall, Irabeth journeyed to the River Kingdoms, where she spent several years righting small wrongs and bringing bandits and scoundrels to justice. To this day, Irabeth is fondly remembered by those she helped find a modicum of justice in a rough-and-tumble land. Some of her old comrades continue to operate as bounty hunters and magistrates across the River Kingdoms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.586,r=0.916,b=0.694), with ID e2ee5b6d-fb72-4799-ad35-b8ab57e71797 -->

**LOVE AND LOSS**  
While working in the River Kingdoms, Irabeth met Anevia, her future wife. Raised as a man, Anevia had been living as a woman for years. The two journeyed to Kenabres together. Upon arrival, Irabeth learned that her parents had come out of retirement to re-join the Mendevian Crusade, and that both of them had died in the notorious Eagle Rock massacre. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.705,r=0.914,b=0.801), with ID a69f2290-7d3c-4dec-971c-36bc35eaaf54 -->

The loss nearly unmoored her, and only Anevia’s love kept Irabeth grounded. In gratitude, when she’d overcome her grief, Irabeth proposed to her lover and presented Anevia with an elixir that would change her physical form to match her identity. Irabeth never told Anevia that she’d sold her father’s sword to fund the transformation, but this secret eventually came out when the sword was recovered from the evil cultists that had bought it from an unscrupulous merchant without Irabeth’s knowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.801,r=0.913,b=0.892), with ID e15b5f89-8daa-4dd8-895b-9c652864388c -->

Although this outcome was unforeseeable, it briefly cast a pall over their joy, as
Anevia wrestled with feelings of unexpected guilt that Irabeth had let her father’s
sword slip away to secure her happiness. However, after its recovery, the sword <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.893,r=0.915,b=0.938), with ID 5993fd4e-d005-4acf-a6d7-176066e9c83e -->

was wielded by a succession of champions who brought great honor to Mendev, which reassured both Irabeth and Anevia that perhaps all of this had been part of Iomedae’s design. Today, Irabeth carries her father’s sword with her, waiting to find the next promising champion to wield it in Iomedae’s name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.080,r=0.617,b=0.141), with ID ae780827-2772-4e18-b9bb-0bb7254e4b5f -->

Soon after Irabeth and Anevia married, they found themselves caught up in world-shaking events. Irabeth rose to renown after a series of heroic successes, culminating with a period of service as steward of Drezen under Queen Galfrey’s command. She continued to serve in the crusade until it ended in victory and the Worldwound’s closure. Feeling that her work was finally done, Irabeth retired with Anevia to her parents’ old farmstead, to live out their lives together in peace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.142,r=0.616,b=0.236), with ID 955f5469-1f91-4d8e-a489-7c5eb40720aa -->

# NO REST FOR THE RIGHTEOUS
For several years, the couple lived happily in their modest home, tending to their fields and fostering orphaned children and youth in need of guidance. Their farm became a haven for many young people who felt ill at ease in society. Irabeth’s half-orc heritage and Anevia’s struggles with her identity had left both of them with deep understanding and compassion for others trying to find their way, and using her heroic reputation to inspire and minister to such aching souls satisfied Irabeth’s need to help. Several of these youths, who consider themselves Irabeth and Anevia’s adopted children, went on to join righteous causes throughout the northlands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.245,r=0.616,b=0.386), with ID 5f905b97-92a9-4919-b776-d79c52c79316 -->

In time, however, Irabeth felt the call to return to the battlefield. Word of the Sarkorian tribes’ efforts to reclaim their long-lost homeland from the demon-blighted wastes of the former Worldwound had spread across Mendev. It struck a chord with Irabeth, who had done exactly that in restoring her parents’ farm. Leaving their homestead in their adopted children’s hands, Irabeth and Anevia returned to Mendev and the lands of their old crusade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.387,r=0.615,b=0.479), with ID 56c77321-de5f-4f9c-8a52-91044de8caae -->

Although Chancellor Irahai—an old friend and respected comrade of both
women—has subtly pressed Irabeth to take greater control of the rebuilding of
Mendev, neither Irabeth nor Anevia has shown any inclination to do so. Irabeth feels
strongly that the Sarkorians should decide the agenda for the reclamation and views
her proper role as protecting and supporting their efforts without compromising
their self-determination. She is acutely aware that some southern crusaders were
dismissive, even cruel toward the indigenous peoples, and she feels a need to atone
for their excesses. Irabeth has worked closely with the Uzunjati spellcasters in the
area, serving as guardian to the Magaambyan envoys when she can, but keeps her
distance from their work, even after their repeated requests. Irabeth is content to lead
warriors against demons on the ground, and Anevia has mostly acted in support
roles behind the scenes. Neither woman wants to play politics in the Sarkoris Scar. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.479,r=0.614,b=0.663), with ID 5fe984b2-37bb-44d2-9b8f-0d834de2d8b5 -->

How long Irabeth will continue to serve, however, remains uncertain. Her parents died after returning to their crusade after a period of retirement, and the ghost of that loss still hangs heavy over both Irabeth and Anevia. Irabeth can’t bear the thought of inflicting similar pain on her loved ones, but in her darker moments, she wonders whether such suffering is inevitable. Perhaps it is the fate of all Iomedae’s champions to fall, someday, in the field. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.663,r=0.614,b=0.755), with ID 0f89bfa3-7f82-4687-90aa-d7453665fe02 -->

And some of her old enemies continue to lurk in the periphery of her life, plotting revenge, such as the vivisectionist **Yurvak the Gut-Braider** (CE male half-fiend alchemist). While not even Yurvak would be foolish enough to strike directly at a paladin as formidable as Irabeth, he is hardly above hurting her by more oblique means. Yurvak recently learned of Irabeth’s return to the Sarkoris Scar, and it has occurred to him that the demons of the frigid north may be able to do what he can’t—if only he can find some way to help them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.755,r=0.615,b=0.863), with ID b6e53008-53dd-47f4-b8ab-cab1a06dc96f -->

# THE TRIALS OF IRABETH
During the Fifth Crusade, Irabeth fought alongside some of the greatest heroes ever known. Though she lacked the mythical power these heroes wielded, Irabeth was able to hold her own against the Worldwound’s harshest environments and fiercest demons. Ever since, rumors have persisted among the surviving crusaders that Irabeth’s role in closing the Worldwound served as her ascension, and that she now holds the same power as those great heroes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.639,t=0.073,r=0.876,b=0.280), with ID 5645b7cb-4fb8-4d7e-aed4-7faec794bf95 -->

# A CHANGING GOVERNMENT
Irahai was quick to establish the Mendevian Delegation, a group of officials that represent the interests of Mendev’s citizens who help establish, enact, and enforce new laws and regulations. With the delegation in place, Irahai’s next goal is to assemble the Sarkorian Council, a group of clan leaders that advise in matters affecting the people of Sarkoris. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.070,r=0.363,b=0.236), with ID ac8f7c13-fba9-47fd-a57f-dc4a42071bd3 -->

# CHANCELLOR OF MENDEV
NG FEMALE HUMAN POLITICIAN
Born to Thuvian crusaders who answered the call to combat the Worldwound, Chancellor Irahai has deep roots in Mendev and personal ties to the region’s tumultuous, demon-scarred recent history. Although her parents were determined to keep Irahai from joining the front lines, she knew from childhood that she wanted to contribute to the war effort. Having grown up among soldiers, Irahai learned the crucial importance of sound logistics from a young age and became a highly capable administrator. When the Worldwound was finally closed, Irahai was the obvious choice to take over Mendev’s provisional government: Queen Galfrey (LG female herald of Iomedae) named Irahai chancellor before ascending, leaving the transition to a civilian structure in Irahai’s hands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.107,r=0.915,b=0.295), with ID 2eb449dd-d78c-49fe-a23a-8c516caec3b8 -->

Chancellor Irahai’s personal background has given her an abiding respect for the courage and sacrifices of the crusade. She views rebuilding Mendev’s strength as crucial to honor the crusade’s work, and she is determined to uphold her duties with integrity. Her experience with demonic schemes has proven invaluable in achieving this goal, for she has recognized and countered several subtle, fiend-driven plots to corrupt the budding civilian nation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.295,r=0.914,b=0.387), with ID fe451e66-ef6a-412c-aeec-060e66572778 -->

Additionally, many of the contacts Irahai developed during her work with
the crusaders have proved useful in her new role as head of the provisional
government. Among the chancellor’s many friends and former comrades is the
renowned Irabeth Tirabade, famous for helping close the Worldwound. Chancellor
Irahai greatly respects the crusader’s heroism and is keenly aware of the potential
political value of Irabeth’s return to the Sarkoris Scar for the effort to reclaim
Sarkoris from the remaining demon armies. Although Irahai strives not to meddle
in Irabeth’s decisions, she does continually calculate their effect on her plans. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.387,r=0.913,b=0.509), with ID 9dbf8061-b9af-417c-9bb3-f06693cda5da -->

The alchemist Artokus Kirran is another of Irahai’s correspondents. After Mendev twice won the bidding for the sun orchid elixir to rejuvenate Queen Galfrey—a project that Irahai handled personally—the chancellor sent a letter of thanks to the famous recluse. Somewhat to Irahai’s surprise, the alchemist responded, and the two began a regular exchange of letters. She enjoys his letters not only for their practicality and insight, but because they often help her understand curious phenomena discovered in the Sarkoris Scar; Kirran’s personal musings also grant Irahai a window into the Thuvian homeland she never knew. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.511,r=0.913,b=0.631), with ID 0958a605-397c-42c7-90d8-2ad9f9be1eda -->

Most of the chancellor’s attention, however, is focused closer to home. Much of Mendev’s wealth was held in trust by crusader lords, and one of Irahai’s biggest and most vexing tasks is the reapportionment of those interests to their rightful, indigenous owners. However, after so much time and tumult, identifying the proper heirs is difficult, particularly given the lack of surviving written records, inheritors’ intermarriage with crusaders, the disqualifying effect of demonic corruptions, and conflicts between Mendevian and Sarkorian rules of inheritance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.633,r=0.913,b=0.739), with ID 08212e67-158d-41d3-80bc-d44bd5e1bec7 -->

# SINS OF THE PAST
Irahai’s unfamiliarity with a scattered and reforged Sarkorian culture has exacerbated her problems. Despite good intentions, the chancellor has occasionally relied on untrustworthy intermediaries. In some cases, she has also been blind to the nuances of ancient, complicated grievances between rival clans—many of whom share common ancestors, and thus have competing claims to the same holdings. Early missteps, alongside the misdeeds of the Mendevian crusaders, have cost her credibility. Though she would dearly like to find someone patient and impartial to help her avoid further errors and make amends for past ones, Chancellor Irahai still lacks a reliable guide through the thickets of interclan disagreement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.752,r=0.913,b=0.906), with ID dac8bd21-00d8-434b-9071-f35c90e49c6f -->

The most grievous of her errors on this front was trusting the Sarkorian shaman **Lokhallat the Wanderer** (NE male human shaman), who advanced <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.437,t=0.909,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID dd45d12b-46b1-4907-ab7f-beb5d8edff30 -->

several misleading claims on ancestral hunting grounds and Sarkorian valuables. Seeking a reliable consultant on Sarkorian issues, Irahai was deceived by a number of testimonials from other Sarkorians, who unfortunately turned out to be accomplices or fellow victims. Lokhallat’s frauds were all built on kernels of truth, and by the time the crusader government disentangled the real merits of his claims, the Wanderer had sold some of his ill-gotten gains and disappeared into the wilderness with the rest of his treasures. In his wake, the frustrated Irahai has accepted the aid of several Uzunjati envoys sent by the Magaambyan Janatimo to better vet further Sarkorian claims and establish rapport with clan leaders, though she considers this another failing on her part and has yet to decide if she can trust the storytellers any more than Lokhallat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.079,r=0.619,b=0.234), with ID 594e5268-06c3-4b4c-be44-e1cf385a9b50 -->

The chancellor’s interest in apprehending Lokhallat the Wanderer is well known and has led to many false sightings. Some of these were genuine mistakes, others have been used strategically by frustrated citizens to draw the thin-stretched government’s attention to problems it had been trying to ignore, and still others have been outlaws’ ruses to distract investigators from their schemes. These false reports have only hardened Irahai’s resolve to catch Lokhallat and put an end to the distractions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.234,r=0.617,b=0.326), with ID 218c76de-b315-46ab-b3b4-fd139982a5fe -->

The stakes of these decisions are high, not only for Chancellor Irahai’s credibility with the Sarkorians, but because crusader holdings represent the vast majority of Mendev’s surviving wealth. Mendev lacks basic infrastructure, and most of what exists was built to serve the crusaders’ military objectives rather than the civilian populace. Much of its need could be addressed with sufficient resources, but Mendev is a poor nation, especially now that the crusaders have largely dispersed, along with the political and material support that southern nations once sent them. Chancellor Irahai simply does not have enough money to do all that must be done, and the financial pressure exacerbates all the others she faces. Mendev’s poverty, and what it means for the government and the people it must protect, keeps her awake at night. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.326,r=0.616,b=0.479), with ID 72360df4-34b6-4513-9c40-03bde1b95910 -->

One possible solution has recently appeared from the cold and enigmatic Lake of Mists and Veils. Chunks of treasure have begun to mysteriously wash up on the lake’s shores, spurring conflicts between unscrupulous former crusaders, ordinary citizens, Sarkorian reclaimers, and the bankrupt government. Foreign agents, including servants of the Numerian conspiracy known as the Blue Streaks, have also taken to plundering the shoreline and escaping Mendev without notice. Yet those who attempt to pursue the treasure into the lake usually vanish without a trace, leaving many households impoverished and bereft even among untold piles of riches. Some say that these prizes are actually the royal treasures of the vanished House Rogarvia of Brevoy, a rumor that has added even more complications to an already-fraught situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.480,r=0.616,b=0.632), with ID 666a000a-cff8-4bbe-ae4b-bf00783a66b8 -->

A portion of this treasure has found its way into the hands of **Akkhara Snarltongue** (LE female halfling knight), a corrupt crusader whose band of cruel mercenaries has become a plague on the lake folk now that they’re no longer drawing a living from the Mendevian crusade. Akkhara and her mercenaries are no better than bandits, but their years of demon-fighting have honed the company into a fiercer adversary than most local militias are capable of facing. Irahai would dearly love to bring the ex-crusaders to justice, ending this persistent headache and stain on Mendev’s reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.633,r=0.615,b=0.740), with ID 6efdbe56-9b9f-4a70-b1f0-72f39b75bb69 -->

Finally, Numeria presents a puzzle of sorts for Irahai to solve. Shortly after the chancellor took control of the provisional government, the Numerian barbarian lord Kevoth-Kul sent a messenger bearing the gift of a sword forged from a strange new skymetal alloy called sovereign steel. No message accompanied the gift, and no one is certain what Kevoth-Kul meant by it. Although the chancellor has tried, discreetly, to probe for some explanation via diplomatic channels, these efforts have, perhaps unsurprisingly, received no answer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.740,r=0.615,b=0.848), with ID 8a48a528-953f-4613-8d2b-a3b6d64e954f -->

# THE SOVEREIGN BLADE
Kevoth-Kul’s gift, which has been given the name Sovereign Blade, vexes Irahai and her advisors. Beyond the fact that the blade is made from a skymetal alloy, its properties remain a mystery. Magical attempts to identify the blade produce varying results. At times, the blade seems capable of channeling electricity, while other times it instead burns like a flame. To the best of the Mendevian mages’ understanding, the blade’s properties change with every attempt to identify them. There is some consistency in the observations, however. Striking the blade always causes it to hum with a pleasant tone for several seconds, reminiscent of a tuning fork. Additionally, every person to study the blade notes a single ability that is always present across their unique identifications. Irahai’s personal diviner, for example, always identifies the blade’s ability to banish conjured creatures, but its other properties always vary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.656,t=0.453,r=0.882,b=0.897), with ID 9185f035-0e20-44c2-bd53-ed6186659bf5 -->

# MURDEROUS VAINGLORY
Like no Blood Mistress before her, Jakalyn maintains an unorthodox public persona. She eschews the mantis mask and makes no attempt to hide her hand in worldly affairs. Many Vernai have shown concern at Jakalyn’s overtness, worrying that she plans to claim sole rulership of the Red Mantis, but in the span of her rule she’s made no noticeable moves toward such a goal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.070,r=0.349,b=0.251), with ID 6602d25a-b578-401e-bbba-116fc62dd22c -->

# JAKALYN

## BLOOD MISTRESS OF THE RED MANTIS

LE FEMALE HUMAN RED MANTIS ASSASSIN

From the spires of the Crimson Citadel, deep in the mountainous jungles of Mediogalti Island, the mysterious leaders of the Red Mantis assassins look down upon the world. Known collectively as the Vernai, these powerful assassins number in the dozens, with each having their own specialties and regions of influence throughout Golarion. Yet even the Vernai have a leader, a deadly honor that can be held only by a woman who has earned the respect and support of at least two-thirds of the Vernai and speaks the will of Achaekek himself: the blood mistress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.071,r=0.914,b=0.247), with ID 61b8b545-f54a-4869-90fe-fcc48a9841d3 -->

While her exact age is unknown, Blood Mistress Jakalyn has ruled the Vernai for
well over a century. Records of her life before she became the blood mistress, as well
as records of the one she replaced, have proven all but impossible to track down, and
those who have made it their mission to do so have invariably become the targets of
assassinations themselves. The same fate has fallen upon those who sought to keep
oral histories of the previous ruler. That the blood mistresses have traditionally lived
secretive lives has only made the mystery easier for Jakalyn to maintain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.249,r=0.914,b=0.356), with ID e803e0ea-708c-4dac-a74a-61ae900bf10a -->

Blood Mistress Jakalyn’s prices for assassinations vary widely—she’s been known
to accept contracts for as little as a handful of copper coins, or to demand outrageous
payments in excess of a hundred thousand gold. Scholars and politicians are aware
of a few deaths that she has personally admitted to orchestrating, but beyond this,
her murderous conquests are the subject of rumor. These range from the old and
outlandish, such as supposed assassination of the god Aroden, to the recent and
plausible, such as the “perished under mysterious circumstances” Lord-Mayor
Haldmeer Grobaras of Magnimar. Jakalyn is content to let these rumors propagate
and spread; even total fabrications can only enhance her reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.357,r=0.913,b=0.494), with ID f6413218-e7ff-4f00-aea8-15f3f273b5f7 -->

Jakalyn appears as a young woman with features that suggest a mix of Tian, 
Nidalese, and Taldan ancestry, only adding further complications to the attempts of 
curious researchers eager to learn more of her time before the Red Mantis. The streak 
of red in her hair is meant to honor the sanguine hues of her murderous deity as 
much as the blood of her many victims. The source of her apparent youth 
is, like her deep history, an enigma. No records of the Red Mantis 
securing doses of the sun orchid elixir exist, for instance, nor is 
there any evidence of rituals performed to endow her with eternal 
life. Jakalyn herself often claims that the deaths of those she’s slain 
keep her young, yet she’s never revealed proof of this claim, and no 
other Red Mantis assassin has ever used such a technique. Jakalyn, of course, 
cares little if others believe her or not.

# BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE
Blood Mistress Jakalyn only rarely leaves the Crimson Citadel for non-assassination purposes, preferring those who seek her aid to make the journey to Mediogalti Isle, navigate the deadly bureaucracy of her underlings to secure an appointment with her, and then survive the grueling overland journey to the Crimson Citadel itself. Even then, she may not deign to meet with the supplicant, or might finally meet with them only to turn down their request for murder on the spot. Stories of her slaughtering those who she deems to have wasted her time further help to limit those who personally seek the blood mistress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.691,r=0.913,b=0.831), with ID 963b5ef5-da23-4541-aa91-2e8b9b950b26 -->

Jakalyn does make exceptions. A recent and notable one was her visit to Cheliax to meet with none other than Queen Abrogail Thrune, who invited Jakalyn to the capital city of Egorian. The queen would have preferred the meeting to be kept secret and private, but Jakalyn refused financial remuneration, demanding only a promise from Abrogail to not interfere with how Jakalyn carries out her work. Soon thereafter, Jakalyn made public her charter from Queen Abrogail, announcing that she had been hired to orchestrate assassinations outside of normal Chelaxian <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.832,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID 81a8ebab-4831-4150-b083-bf2ef73aa859 -->

Order of the Scourge. Abrogail was furious but could do 
association with the blood mistress. The agreement is still you
no assassinations have provably taken place, but the word itself
has been enough to curtail the Scourge’s investigations into
Abrogail. Whether or not Jakalyn intends to follow through
on the task or not, public knowledge of her involvement may
have been enough to solve Queen Abrogail’s problem without
a drop of blood shed—though she may one day regret the
price she paid for it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.080,r=0.491,b=0.235), with ID 90fccaca-d5e0-4693-af51-2236fbc3cad1 -->

This was not the first time the two women’s paths have
crossed. Several months ago, the queen tried to hire a
lower-ranking member of the Vernai to assassinate the Rahadoumi
healer Kassi Aziril, only to be shocked when Jakalyn intervened and voided the
contract. The Blood Mistress explained to Abrogail that Kassi had already been
targeted by the assassins years before on false pretenses. Misinformation had
made it appear that Kassi had resurrected an earlier victim of the Red Mantis
using an obscure occult ritual. However, Jakalyn learned that the victim had not
perished; the assassin who had been sent on that job botched the murder and left
the target unconscious but alive. Kassi’s ministrations only saved the target from
death rather than restoring them from death. As recompense, Jakalyn granted
Kassi immunity to further Red Mantis assassinations as a show of good will.
Abrogail did not let this setback delay her for long, ordering Kassi excruciated

Blood Mistress Jakalyn has learned that not all problems facing the Red Mantis
can be solved by the threat of assassination, particularly when she or her agents
are vexed by those they can’t move against, such as rightful monarchs or rulers of
nations. Her preferred method of action against such foes is to enjoin the services
of adventurers, but she makes these offers only to groups who are already opposed
to her intended target. In this way, she’s found that it takes very little to push a
group into doing her bidding, even in cases where the group itself would rather
fight her instead. While payments of gold and magic are the typical rewards she
offers for such missions, Jakalyn has been known to offer assassination services to
those who please her. If murder’s not to their liking, she can even offer adventurers
clemencies—promises that no Red Mantis assassin will take a contract against
a target or targets of the adventurers’ choosing. These clemencies are almost
always temporary injunctions, and in cases where Jakalyn secretly knows a target
will be placed on the list soon, she arranges the length of these clemencies to her
advantage. For those outside the Red Mantis’s inner circle, Jakalyn has also been
known to offer access to secret trainings or techniques normally reserved for the
assassins themselves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.448,r=0.619,b=0.711), with ID 9f75cac2-26e2-46ec-99e9-74536b1ad738 -->

# SECRETS OF THE VERNAI
The Red Mantis Assassin archetype appears on page 71 of the *Lost Omens World Guide*. Of the additional options below, only Prayer Attack is available freely to Red Mantis assassins without prior permission from the Blood Mistress. Those who dare learn these rare abilities without her permission run the risk of being cast out of the society and hunted down by their former allies. In theory, a daring infiltration of the Crimson Citadel could allow one to study hidden texts and learn these techniques, but the chambers within and below this fortress are among the most dangerous in the region, so such an attempt should not be made lightly! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.719,r=0.619,b=0.865), with ID 6504d578-be95-4836-be33-6754bad19c7a -->

# A MODEST PROPOSAL

An unnamed messenger representing a mysterious patron recently approached Jakalyn with an outlandish and shocking request–the assassination of none other than Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant. The messenger claimed that Tar-Baphon was no legitimate ruler, and argued that the Tyrant was a power-hungry fool attempting to become a god, a clear offense to Achaekek and the Red Mantis. When Jakalyn grew frustrated at the patron’s attempts to remain anonymous, she had the messenger imprisoned and announced the request and incarceration publicly. After months went by with no one stepping forward to admit their association with the imprisoned messenger, Jakalyn discovered through her own investigation that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. Whispers that Jakalyn may be considering a retaliatory assassination against Razmir himself have begun to spread, as have rumors that she’s still considering taking the contract on Tar-Baphon. Both Razmir and Tar-Baphon’s power are great enough to combat most threats, but the attention of one of the world’s most dangerous killers is something that neither lich nor “god” would be wise to ignore. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.648,t=0.277,r=0.886,b=0.855), with ID 8a5d23a9-9379-498a-9b83-87ac7e178890 -->

Summary : This is a stylized illustration of a fantasy city or castle complex above ground, with an extensive labeled network of underground chambers and tunnels depicted below. Five key locations (A–E) are marked with red circular labels.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The upper portion shows a grand, red-hued fantasy city or palace with tall spires and a central domed structure, set atop a green hill.
  • The lower portion reveals a cutaway view of a complex system of underground caves, tunnels, and chambers, rendered in grayscale.
  • Five locations are labeled with red circles and white letters: A (city above ground), B, C, D, and E (various underground areas).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The illustration uses a parchment-style background and a hand-drawn, fantasy aesthetic.
  • No text other than the location labels (A–E) is visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The city (A) is directly above the underground network, suggesting it sits atop these hidden chambers.
  • The underground system is horizontally extensive, with multiple branching paths and distinct zones.
  • Each labeled location (B–E) corresponds to a unique chamber or area within the underground network, spatially separated from one another.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates the idea of a hidden, intricate world beneath a grand city, with multiple distinct underground locations.
  • The labeled points (A–E) likely serve as reference markers for navigation or storytelling within this setting.
  • The composition emphasizes the contrast between the majestic city above and the mysterious, labyrinthine world below. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.080,r=0.877,b=0.485), with ID c8257172-07aa-4d65-be7f-6464f09bbf05 -->

The Uzunjati are those among the Magaambya who learn and speak tales, from and to all peoples we encounter.

# JANATIMO

SPEAKER OF THE WORLD’S TALES  
CG MALE HALF-ELF BARD

My tale is intertwined with millions of othe

of the Uzunjati, the Learned One of the Mag  
Tales, and I remember everything. Being bo  
of the Magaambya, my destiny was alway

My tale is intertwined with millions of others, like the first strand atop which a spiders’ web is built, but I shall do what I can to recount it. I am Janatimo, head of the Uzunjati, the Learned One of the Magaambya, Speaker of All the World’s Tales, and I remember everything. Being born from the union of two scholars of the Magaambya, my destiny was always to follow in their footsteps, but being born with the gift of perfect recollection meant that I would never know a normal childhood. I was tutored from infancy so that I might serve as a living archive for as much knowledge as possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.392,t=0.134,r=0.917,b=0.264), with ID 2489ff1e-3764-46ec-bc7a-3bb774325a88 -->

The role I fill within the Magaambya now is quite unique. I am a teacher of our collected knowledge, but I also serve as a guide for how best to wield newfound understandings from the stories I tell. I give students lessons on magic in the form of tales of humility. I teach them history by speaking of long dead heroes from ages past. My lessons are those of context and perspective, not simply cold facts. To recite a tale is to offer all the truths contained within, not simply those that I see or choose to acknowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.264,r=0.912,b=0.374), with ID 85a66fac-f89b-409b-85f2-8d18e6e41d12 -->

My purpose, and by extension the purpose of the Uzunjati, is to preserve stories. Stories provide context for our histories so that we are not just beholden to our past, but that we might learn from our memories.

From the folklore of the long dead to the bedtime stories told by a loving father so that his child might grow up to be kind and wise, every tale is precious. Bitter enemies can become treasured friends with the right story of compassion and forgiveness to bridge the gap. Stories are the lifeblood that flows through our world. Each and every tale has a lesson to be learned, a warning to be heeded, something of value to be gained for all those that choose to perk their ears and listen. To forget a story and all of the gifts it bears is a tragedy, like forgetting the face of a once-cherished lover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.421,t=0.359,r=0.913,b=0.556), with ID ebcb179c-c9f3-4610-a811-4d8a047e3e82 -->

To that end, I have brought the Uzunjati to Avistan. We cannot
simply sit by in our libraries, hoarding our knowledge and only
sharing it with those who seek us out. There are magics stirring in
Avistan the likes of which have not been seen since the time of Old-
Mage Jatembe himself. The people of Thassilon once again walk
among the living, long after most of the waking world forgot them;
their stories must be recovered and recounted so that they are not
forgotten again. And who else better suited to ease them peacefully
into their current circumstances than those that can recount all their
lost years for them? The Whispering Tyrant’s attempt to ascend to
godhood has meant the loss of thousands, which is unthinkable
from a moral perspective alone, but also consider the potential loss
of generations of knowledge along with them. This atrocity has
convinced even the most conservative among my order to agree that
we must act. None are more suited to understand and help deal with
such magical threats as the Magaambya. It is our duty as scholars, teachers,
and storytellers to put our knowledge to the protection and betterment of
the world we all share. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.556,r=0.914,b=0.829), with ID 928130a2-5981-40fa-8eda-358d94ac7e56 -->

Summary : This image is an illustration showing the lower legs and feet of a person wearing historical or ceremonial attire, including white shoes and white pants with gold trim at the hem of a robe.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is the lower portion of a person, focusing on the feet and lower legs.

  • The perspective is at ground level, showing both feet, with the left foot slightly forward and the right foot back.
  • The colour palette is primarily white, gold, and a hint of blue from the upper garment.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration style is painterly and detailed, with shading to indicate folds in the fabric and the shape of the shoes.

  • The gold trim at the hem is consistent across both legs, indicating a single garment.

Analysis :
  • The image emphasizes the ornate and formal nature of the attire, likely indicating a ceremonial or historical context.
  • The focus on the shoes and lower garment suggests attention to detail in dress and presentation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.776,r=0.385,b=0.953), with ID 97c8aa29-b92e-4128-9c7d-cea8340ca6db -->

# TALES OF THE NORTH
Magaambya was originally founded so that Old-Mage Jatembe’s teachings of magic could be spread to all that wished to learn them. While this is still a noble goal and one I personally take great pride in pursuing, there is so much more for us to do in Avistan. After all my studies of the Old-Mage’s works, I’ve come to see magic as a living thing; if not used, it stagnates and withers within us. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.843,r=0.915,b=0.940), with ID 7fef3b31-fa58-4439-ab87-c6dcb1310d94 -->

When used for ill, the intentions of the user corrupt it. To preserve magic, we must not just practice it, but use it for good. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.079,r=0.597,b=0.111), with ID 8b9c05e7-6933-4303-a96d-17aac81d97a0 -->

I feel a great deal of kinship toward Kalabrynne Iomedar and her child, Clarethe. These two Knights of Lastwall seek the ultimate defeat of Tar-Baphon, while I prioritize using the knowledge my people have accumulated to rehabilitate and right the Gravelands that he created. To start a revitalization effort in the Gravelands, the sources of its corruption must be rooted out and contained. My researchers believe that these sources are ancient, tainted artifacts that, if removed or destroyed, would end large portions of the corruption that the land suffers. Above all, we in the Magaambya believe we have a duty to the people of this world, and that the burden falls upon us to protect those who can’t protect themselves. For their efforts, I have nothing but respect and admiration for all the Knights of Lastwall and those who have rallied to their banner. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.111,r=0.617,b=0.294), with ID 49f6c738-b394-4072-9e54-9df6505fa3bd -->

I also have a particular interest in Sorshen’s story. Once a terrible force for evil, she has renounced her title as runelord and has the potential to be a great asset to the people of Avistan. I can think of none better suited to help us restore the Gravelands than a reformed runelord, if we could persuade her to share her knowledge of magic with the Magaambya. Hers could be a tale of redemption I tell for generations to come. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.296,r=0.617,b=0.387), with ID c0f57f5b-c8bb-4029-b034-c75afea54c08 -->

I sent Uzunjati out to the Sarkoris Scar to help the people that wish to resettle, but also to collect their stories. The survivors of that murdered nation scattered across the world and are now returning, bearing tales of their ancestors before, their exodus now, and their hopes for the future. Efforts to rebuild are proving dangerous, however, as demons left over from the war still wander the Scar’s twisted landscape.

# JANATIMO’S SECRET LESSONS
As a storyteller, Janatimo loves sharing his knowledge with others and helping expand their worldviews, so most of his innovations have passed on to the Uzunjati or the world at large. But there are a few small things he keeps to himself and his closest friends and students, among those a special Uzunjati storytelling technique that could be used to harm the innocent if it fell into the wrong hands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.552,r=0.615,b=0.648), with ID df65d7f5-6edb-497c-a60a-0f9940f3d27f -->

RARE   ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Uzunjati Recollection (Lost Omens Character Guide 103)
Thanks to Janatimo’s secret techniques, you can weave your knowledge and words into powerful tools to assist your allies in life-threatening situations. When you use Uzunjati Recollection to tell a story and Recall Knowledge about a creature during a combat encounter, if you succeed at both checks, your story carries deeper meaning. This grants your allies a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll and saving throw against the creature during that encounter, as well as to their AC against that creature’s next attack roll during that encounter. If you critically succeed at both checks, the bonuses also apply to all attack rolls, saves, and AC against that creature for 2 rounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.659,r=0.615,b=0.846), with ID fbdfed53-36f3-4ffd-932c-52ca6ded2f75 -->

TROUBLED PROTÉGÉS  
  Sihar, the leader of the Bright Lions, is an old student of mine. She came to the Magaambya to learn what she could of the gods, so that one day she might use this knowledge to end Walkena's tyrannical reign in Mzali. I armed her with as much knowledge as I could, informing her that some of the bravest of the Emerald Boughs had already chosen to live secretly among the people of Mzali and see what they might learn. Sihar has since told me that a number of these Emerald Boughs have drawn too much attention to themselves. She is unable to do much to aid them, with her Bright Lions being stretched thin as is, but she told me she's willing to assist as much as she can with any efforts to smuggle my people out of the city. The Emerald Boughs are community organizers, not warriors. I fear for them if Walkena's ire falls upon them before they can be rescued. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.655,t=0.347,r=0.883,b=0.775), with ID 0129a5a3-40cb-4ecb-93b1-de46f7c41b4f -->

# AGE IS A MINDSET
Even in the earliest tales about him, Jatembe has always been described as an old man. Some people claim this to be a metaphor, while others ponder the unknown origins of Jatembe and how he spent his early life. Most simply consider age to be an inalienable fact of Jatembe’s existence, with no justification needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.070,r=0.362,b=0.221), with ID ea0bb5ba-efcd-42cb-ad25-d3f3fccebd6f -->

FOUNDER OF THE MAGAAMBYA
NG MALE HUMAN WIZARD
One of Golarion’s most famous and influential figures, Old-Mage Jatembe rediscovered magic and spent decades helping lift the peoples of the Mwangi Expanse from the dust of Earthfall, then disappeared with no sign of death or destination. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.105,r=0.916,b=0.190), with ID c508d4ec-1f5c-4b4e-a686-8c00d16a4f89 -->

# JATEMBE AND THE LOCKED MOUNTAIN
*In the days after sky joined earth, Jatembe searched the ruins of those who came before. He had a powerful desire for knowledge and drank up whatever he discovered in the wreckage. He rolled facts and stories around in his head, tumbling them until they were like precious gems, shining in his private collection. When he learned that the Greatest Understanding was kept deep in Locked Mountain, what else could he do but seek it?* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.198,r=0.916,b=0.309), with ID f6ded88e-cbfd-4626-b9ad-12361d4b7288 -->

He traveled for season upon season. He wove the boat Bunta to ride the rivers. He hewed his first staff to help him cross savanna and traverse jungle. He made broad sandals to brave the snows of the mountain’s treacherous slopes. When at last he arrived at the summit of Locked Mountain, there was no entrance.
    “In the ruins, there were clever boxes with hidden latches,” he mused. “It is the same with mountains.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.310,r=0.916,b=0.402), with ID cc069d18-0689-4cf9-9474-42366b981791 -->

*But it was so dark in that time, and he could not see. So, he softly sang to the hidden sun. Moved, she reached down to gift him a golden sphere of her light. It shone on the mountain’s face, revealing a door. Jatembe pushed and pulled and pushed, but the door did not open.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.402,r=0.915,b=0.464), with ID 9a4c70dc-c21b-40b8-b908-5dfce275d527 -->

*Jatembe heard a voice call from a tiny hole in the stone. “Jatembe, this is Locked Mountain,” taunted Obsidian from his home in the lock, “and even if your eyes can see the door, your hands cannot open it.”*
    *“Come here, Obsidian,” said Jatembe, “and tell me what you mean. For I am too foolish, and do not understand.”* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.463,r=0.915,b=0.541), with ID 9f44720a-b7bd-4121-9b34-5876d90f5cd8 -->

*Obsidian slithered, laughing and mocking, from the hole, but as soon as it did Jatembe snatched it up and plucked off its head. “Your whispers are mine, now,” he said as he twisted the creature into a key to fit the lock.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.540,r=0.914,b=0.587), with ID 3a7a1e76-d441-4b1b-9eee-2a71fe156923 -->

Jatembe unlocked the door and stepped into a new darkness that drank up even the hidden sun’s golden gift. His chest stirred. *He saw that from his heart a silver river now rushed into the dark gulf before him. He stood, awestruck, until he noticed a tiny shape picking its way along the shining current—a silver spider.*

    “Jatembe, this is not your river,” the spider whispered. “Your lot is to spiral down the silver flow and *disappear*.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.586,r=0.915,b=0.677), with ID e9e83581-02b6-421c-a0d4-e44c2b0c70ce -->

*But even in the days after sky joined earth, Jatembe was already old and wise. He deduced the secret of souls. “But the river flows from me, and I flow in the river. How can I intrude on what I make, and on what has made me?”*

*The spider was surprised. She cocked her head, listening to someone secret, and nodded. “The Lady agrees. Seek your Understanding on her river.” When Jatembe looked down, his chest was no longer a wellspring, and he was already riding Bunta among the silver currents.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.678,r=0.914,b=0.785), with ID bcf08199-d012-47d9-b98c-5b4a93f2a39d -->

The two rode the river through the dark for a long, long time, until the sun’s gift shone once more. The river turned to a golden mist that flowed out of the mountain to fill the space between worlds. It carried Bunta away, leaving Jatembe standing before a creature as wise as him. It stretched its wings and lifted a lion’s paw in greeting.

      “You seek the Greatest Understanding, Jatembe.” It smiled at him. Its face looked exactly like his. “But what would you do with it?”
      Jatembe answered. “I would know of locks and rivers and revelations. I would comprehend their connections. I would know...”
      At that moment, the sun’s gift split into four lights crafted from all the colors of the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.785,r=0.914,b=0.938), with ID 40dda21a-f107-4466-8ad6-690ba529e787 -->

“I do know,” said both shocked faces, as Jatembe’s very own voice now poured from each. “I know the foundations upon which the world is built. I know that a gem is not precious if it is hidden. I know that knowledge is not for me alone to hold.”
   Jatembe looked around. There was no more mountain. He took his staff and his falcon’s wings. He traveled everywhere to share the gift of magic.
   And that’s why we have magic today. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.078,r=0.620,b=0.174), with ID 6d534470-5871-4f34-bd24-83c0e9bc8f12 -->

# HISTORY LESSONS
“Well, what did you think?” Ieme’s four conjured lights flared as he dispelled them, reflected briefly in his silver cheek tattoos.

His large arachnid companion chirred, shaking his bright abdomen back and forth in excitement. “Wonderful, my heart! Perfect timing, perfect inflection, perfect magical accompaniment—a perfect telling. With a performance like that, Lore-Speaker Zegaji will finally recommend us for Conversant advancement!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.182,r=0.619,b=0.296), with ID 8ec6bb10-a31a-4845-883f-a5356b8d4b43 -->

Ieme smiled; for once, his excitement broke through his reserved demeanor. “I hope she’s half as indulgent as you are. But maybe you’re right.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.296,r=0.618,b=0.326), with ID 3d715555-65b8-4d0a-8e45-b8d4681aa621 -->

There was the rustling sound of the gray and yellow anadi’s transformation, and then Kedari wrapped Ieme in a warm human embrace. Ieme laughed and kissed Kedari on the cheek. The horns signaled midday meal, and the two set off to find food and a spot to talk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.327,r=0.618,b=0.388), with ID 7ad6363d-5174-4ce1-8b31-a29cd9b7be74 -->

“I wish I could include more sources,” mused Ieme over goat pepper soup. “‘Jatembe bound the serpent-god’s flayed skull with its own tongue’—that’s much more interesting than Obsidian.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.387,r=0.617,b=0.433), with ID 5a7bd129-1dba-43ed-a42c-4822e44d445c -->

“Add intertextuality next performance,” mumbled Kedari through mandibles full of ackee. “Right now, we know Zegaji will want Jatembe’s deeds post his magical discovery. What comes after?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.433,r=0.617,b=0.479), with ID 7e7c0f5d-dc0a-4f6a-909c-cbfb6a9c01f5 -->

Ieme wiped his mouth and proceeded. “Jatembe sought out exceptional
individuals and asked them to give up their names to serve their people. These
Ten Magic Warriors then helped Jatembe build Nantambu and used one hundred
and eleven scrolls to found the first library of the new Magaambya Academy.
They formed the Magaambya’s five branches and gathered students from across
the Mwangi Expanse.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.480,r=0.617,b=0.571), with ID 50a3af4e-f9cf-4551-9df2-22209f0c88db -->

They reviewed what they’d prepared about the Old-Mage’s greatest deeds: how Jatembe heard the cries of Ird’s trees and plants, felt their fear of the city’s monstrous conduct, and helped them rise up to engulf it. The battle at the *Doorway to the Red Star* against the King of Biting Ants, whose eyes crawled across every leaf and tasted every person and animal, and the triad of Swarming Cathedrals he controlled. There the Eleven Heroes fought alongside the first Iobane, whose psychic power helped scatter the insectile sorcerer’s body and mind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.571,r=0.616,b=0.679), with ID 4b4d0214-f7af-4fde-a203-8464324ce290 -->

Next, the tale of Agohbindi the Splintering Child, the gruesome Spawn of Rovagug, which once snuck beneath the flow of the Vanji to attack Nantambu. Tempest-Sun Mages kept it at bay but were cut down by shearing beams and thousands of gleaming teeth. Jatembe called fire and lightning to stun its many bodies, then turned his magic into trees that bound the creature and kept it from reassembling. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.678,r=0.616,b=0.770), with ID 760a20d0-96c8-43ae-afe9-069cdaa193d8 -->

Ieme tapped his chin as he finished. “You know, rare Rain-Scribe records mention crackling or burning trees that disappear every few years. Others speak of ‘splitting sickness’ in some communities, where wounds don’t heal and the afflicted eventually fall apart.” He swallowed. “Or where they immolate their families and shamble away. Maybe Agohbindi is reassembling.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.770,r=0.617,b=0.847), with ID 527f30f4-cab2-49b3-9a04-6b2113b9954c -->

# FESTIVAL OF MASKS
Jatembe is known and respected across the whole of the Mwangi Expanse, even among those people who otherwise have a strong dislike of arcane magic. The 13th of Desnus is a major day of celebration in most Mwangi cities, serving to honor Jatembe and his Ten Magic Warriors–though the form these celebrations take varies wildly depending on the people involved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.069,r=0.363,b=0.253), with ID 18dcbca4-6d77-4b5a-8cb0-0688a84f8825 -->

**REHEARSAL**
The two found an empty amphitheater. Kedari went through the story cycle called *Jatembe’s Legacy*. He started with “Blackbird and the Wingless,” where Blackbird teaches cities to fly, and ended with the traditional “Old-Mage Collects His Thoughts.” In the comedic tale of the days just prior to his disappearance, Jatembe’s knowledge flees and hides all over Nantambu. The Old-Mage must chase after each thought to trap it in a book, forming the very first copy of *Wisdom of Jatembe*. Kedari even included the copy Ieme had gifted him in his performance, continuing the tradition of students passing on their knowledge to those that came next. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.381,t=0.074,r=0.918,b=0.218), with ID 1b8374a5-f98b-4c91-abfa-3a4112860b0e -->

Ieme adopted a creaking voice for his first-person account of “Grandfather
Traveler and the Iron Hag,” in which a twice-and-twice-learned wizard outwits an
evil witch, trading her a cup of yasht instead of a lake of souls. He binds her by her
own words, and supposedly the two meet “whenever eight dozen followers catch
nine dozen thrushes” so that he may set her to some benevolent task. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.219,r=0.916,b=0.295), with ID 446b0f8c-a639-4baf-ac9b-040879e22fbb -->

Light caught Ieme’s eye. The sun dipped toward the horizon, and the mosaic tiles of Nantambu’s towers shone.
“It’s getting late, but we’re almost done. The finale?” Ieme smirked, anticipating his friend and partner’s response. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.296,r=0.916,b=0.356), with ID f1542e75-071e-4af5-a4d8-55e64cdd7039 -->

“Evidence that Jatembe might still be alive and active!” Kedari adopted Zegaji’s lecture stance and pitched his voice in imitation. “Look at ‘Grandfather Traveler’s Deal and the Dead Shepherd.’ It’s all but explicit that Tosof is a psychopomp, and the exact wording of her statement that Grandfather Traveler ‘will live to see the flying city rise and fall a second time’ is present in multiple sources.” He waved his legs excitedly. “That can’t be coincidence.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.356,r=0.916,b=0.448), with ID 53f1b9af-851e-4004-b7a3-659f376f97cd -->

“Well, it could be, but you also followed dozens of leads to reputable sources. Zegaji respects diligence.” Ieme squeezed Kedari’s shoulder. “But prophecy is no longer certain, and our other examples aren’t as sure. Reports of an old man visiting fried insect stalls and amber dealers on the same dates every few years? A similar man asking about masks of very specific colors?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.449,r=0.915,b=0.525), with ID 792f46c7-52db-4ec4-8b2d-7abf4648a9f7 -->

He gestured outside to where the sun’s last rays were illuminating the towers, where mosaic depictions of the Ten Magic Warriors’ distinctive, colorful masks purpled in the twilight. “Have the Warriors’ first masks actually reappeared after all this time? And if they have, would Jatembe—assuming he’s alive—come back to claim them?

Kedari dipped his abdomen in an anadi shrug. “Who knows. But it’s a wonderful detail to dangle in Zegaji’s face!

Summary : This is a stylized illustration divided into three vertical panels, each depicting a robed figure with a staff interacting with different mythological or historical scenes: a sunlit landscape with a serpent, a cave with a winged figure, and an Egyptian sphinx.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image is split into three distinct vertical sections, each with a unique background and central figure.
  • Left panel: A robed figure stands in a boat on water, gesturing toward a bright sun and mountainous landscape, with a large serpent emerging from the water.
  • Center panel: The same robed figure stands before a cave entrance, facing a tall, armored, winged figure holding a staff or scepter, with icy blue tones dominating the scene.
  • Right panel: The robed figure approaches a large, stylized sphinx in a desert landscape, with golden-yellow hues and pyramidal forms in the background.
  • The composition uses bold, geometric shapes and a vibrant, high-contrast color palette.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or numeric annotations are present.
  • The illustration style is polygonal and abstract, with clear demarcation between the three scenes.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with each panel having its own dominant light source and color temperature.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The robed figure appears in all three panels, suggesting a narrative or journey across different mythological or historical settings.
  • Foreground: The robed figure and the main mythological/historical element (serpent, winged figure, sphinx).
  • Background: Distinct environmental cues (mountains and sun, cave interior, desert and pyramids).
  • The panels are arranged left-to-right, possibly indicating a sequence or progression.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually narrates a journey or quest, with the central character encountering different legendary or symbolic beings in varied environments.
  • The use of color and composition emphasizes the contrast between the three settings, highlighting the diversity of challenges or encounters.
  • The repeated presence of the robed figure suggests continuity and a unifying narrative thread across mythological, fantastical, and historical themes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.001,r=0.897,b=0.478), with ID f8e16573-28f0-4a2c-b4a4-d0c10c3c9939 -->

Range touch; Targets one willing creature of lower level than you  
Duration until your next daily preparations

You infuse magical energy into your target, opening up their mind to the pathways of magic and granting them the ability to use magic to affect the world around them. Choose a 1st-level spell you prepared today or that’s in your repertoire, of the same tradition you used to cast halcyon infusion. The spell must be one that has a listed range. If the target is at least 3rd level, you can choose a 2nd-level spell instead of a 1st-level spell; and if the target is at least 5th level, you can choose a 3rd-level spell. The target can Cast the Spell once per day as an innate spell of the tradition you used to cast halcyon infusion. If they are untrained in the appropriate magical tradition, their spell attack bonus is 2 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier, and their spell DC is 12 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier. Unlike most abilities that can only be used once per day, the target refreshes their use of the granted innate spell each day only after you make your daily preparations and choose to extend halcyon infusion’s duration by either refraining from preparing a spell in the slot (if you’re a prepared spellcaster) or expending another spell slot (if you’re a spontaneous spellcaster). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.565,r=0.619,b=0.891), with ID 598e97e4-4d8a-464b-bb43-3ed113500484 -->

# KNIGHTLY IDOLS
While no knight of Lastwall has rank above another, Kalabrynne and Clarethe Iomedar, nicknamed the Lion of Iomedae and the Sunset Angel, respectively, are looked up to by those who serve in the field. Especially among women, the pair have inspired many aspirations toward chivalry and heroism and more than their fair share of amorous crushes—the latter of which is a source of mild embarrassment for both of them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.070,r=0.362,b=0.252), with ID c3915879-92cb-488f-8042-68d0024e6904 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a female knight in ornate armor, holding a sword and shield, with a blue and gold cape and fur-trimmed mantle, standing in a heroic pose.

illustration:

### KNIGHTS OF LASTWALL
None are called leader among the Knights of Lastwall, for when Vigil fell, they realized that to elect a leader is to show your enemy your greatest weakness. Just look at our foe! When the Whispering Tyrant was sealed within Gallowspire by the Shining Crusade centuries ago, his empire fell to pieces, for it could not survive without his iron grip. Now that Tar-Baphon has escaped and returned to power, all must band together to defeat him—not as servants and masters, but as comrades united with glorious purpose. Yet there are two who stand tall among the knights. I will not call these two our leaders; but they are an inspiration to all those who hold the banner of Lastwall high. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.138,r=0.916,b=0.296), with ID 367eaf4e-e638-4360-9eb5-cba03cf0aeba -->

ADVISOR TO THE KNIGHTS OF LASTWALL  
LG FEMALE HUMAN PALADIN  
The elder Iomedar was born among the common folk of Vigil, capital of fallen Lastwall, and had barely seen her fifteenth birthday when her heart called her to join our predecessors, the Knights of Ozem. During this time, she found love with an Iomedaean priestess, Gwyndria Iomedar of Firrine, and when the two were wed Kalabrynne took her wife’s name for her own. The two lived in Vigil for over a decade, and in time they were blessed with child; we will come to her soon enough.

Alas, Gwyndria was among those tragically lost when the Whispering Tyrant unleashed the Radiant Fire upon Vigil. Kalabrynne survived the cataclysm, however, and though her heart surely ached at the loss, she rallied what survivors she could find and led their retreat to Vellumis. Once the survivors were safe in that port city, Kalabrynne called a meeting of all knights, soldiers, and able-bodied folk present there; in the days that followed, with many an impassioned speech and insightful plea, she organized the ragged survivors of a fallen nation into the proud and courageous Knights of Lastwall. The remains of Gwyndria were never recovered; either Iomeda r would be grateful beyond words for their recovery, for unconsecrated bones in the Gravelands rarely find peace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.482,r=0.915,b=0.678), with ID 0a8adb67-7287-4fca-b221-01fd0ff55a3e -->

Kalabrynne today is all at once wise counselor, inspiring orator,
canny tactician, and indefatigable warrior. In speech she is reserved
unless the situation demands boldness, and in aspect she is as stately
and as beautiful as any late-blooming woman might hope to be. I
say “late-blooming,” for like me, she was taken for a boy at birth,
and raised as such until she had the sense to become her truest self.
When I left my birthplace of Absalom as a fresh-faced squire of
the knights—and newly minted maiden besides—I hastened first
to Vellumis, for all the knights I met spoke of her wisdom and
nobility, and to see a late-blooming woman like me held in such
honor was like a dream made real. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.472,t=0.680,r=0.915,b=0.846), with ID aba88d53-517d-477e-a32f-9d677a62fc81 -->

I learned much in her service of honor, nobility, and chivalry; and much too of tactics and leadership. There I gained the courage and conviction to hold fast against the direst threat. Nor am I or my fellow knights the only visitors Vellumis has received, for Kalabrynne has championed the knights’ outreach across the Inner Sea region. Though she refuses to quit the Gravelands, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.847,r=0.914,b=0.938), with ID 7df87a4b-51aa-4a12-8dff-166240c25a6c -->

Kalabrynne hosts the Magaambya wizard Janatimo to this end, for an alliance
with his distant school would forward our cause greatly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.078,r=0.617,b=0.113), with ID e0449e83-a1d9-4a14-b325-6c791da7bf9f -->

Outreach and Alliance
Our great crusade will succeed only with the support of many, and so Kalabrynne sends diplomats to every corner of the Inner Sea region. Taldor was among the first nations to receive her envoys, for all Taldans recall the Shining Crusade with pride, and my fellow knights ply the nation's inns and noble salons for new allies. Word has reached me that Kalabrynne now seeks envoys to travel to the court of Grand Princess Eutropia herself; any knights sent hence must be cunning indeed, for the intrigues of nobles cannot be rebuffed by stout shields nor vanquished by force of arms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.124,r=0.616,b=0.249), with ID 75e742f6-d383-4353-aa79-52bff884fb4b -->

Perhaps the most dangerous diplomatic missions, however, are those closest to home. Kalabrynne has sent diplomats to Overlord Ardax of Belkzen, and likewise to General Azaersi of Oprak, and has also made peace with several goblin tribes in the Gravelands. Though these peoples might once have been foes of Lastwall, the Whispering Way is a threat to all life. Human and goblin, hobgoblin and orc; what differences are these when faced with the horror of undeath? But old grudges run deep, and old scars ache long, and Kalabrynne keenly remembers how even loyal knights such as Irabeth Tirabade were treated merely for having an orc as a father. And so only the bravest and most well-spoken knights are sent as envoys to these long-shunned peoples. Kalabrynne is always looking for new candidates for such missions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.250,r=0.616,b=0.403), with ID b97b55a7-81a0-4628-abb4-b4fa1e962abd -->

On the matter of our fellow knight Ulthun II, the Iomedars are split, although neither would doubt his integrity nor call him unfit to claim the title of knight of Lastwall. In her wisdom, Kalabrynne sees his efforts to direct the vast resources of the Inner Sea region to our cause as a vital necessity, for the machine of war must be oiled with gold. The younger Iomedar, in her customarily outspoken fashion, grumbles about the former watcher-lord’s retreat to the distant refuge of Absalom, for in her eyes he has not fulfilled his duty to the ruins of Lastwall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.403,r=0.615,b=0.511), with ID e1dd6017-b7ca-4ee7-9355-524a0fff786d -->

INSPIRING CRIMSON RECLAIMER
CG NONBINARY HUMAN LIBERATOR
Kalabrynne and Gwyndria had but one child before Lastwall fell. Knowing the struggle of gender wrongly imposed, Kalabrynne saw to it that their child was not raised as a specific gender identity but given the time and space necessary for self-discovery. For her part, Clarethe has made clear that feminine pronouns are most appropriate, yet she is quick to remind the curious or presumptive that she is neither female nor male—and equally quick to punish those who behave in bigoted fashion, for such hatred is as much violence as a sword’s stroke. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.552,r=0.615,b=0.693), with ID f6f324f5-d698-48b0-9258-e40dfcd4059c -->

Of Clarethe’s career before the fall, there is little to tell. She joined Lastwall’s
military as a squire, and in its service traveled the length and breadth of the nation.
Even then, she was known as a brash and pugnacious youth, and more than once
risked discharge for both her deeds and her outspoken attitude. She was far from
Vigil when it fell, and came to Vellumis only after the order had been formed; by all
accounts, though, Clarethe took to knighthood with fierce zeal. On one occasion, she
rode out at day’s end (alone!) to aid a band of knights ambushed on patrol—a deed
which earned her the admiring title of “Sunset Angel” from her fellows. Certainly, she
has taken to the name, preferring to strike when the setting sun paints the sky scarlet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.694,r=0.615,b=0.832), with ID 57116131-1efa-4dcd-b5d3-be8781550a89 -->

“I made them for crusaders traveling up to the Worldwound,” the man explained. “For them to remember the homes and loved ones they left behind.

In the back, under a panel of rose
gold inscribed “Vigil’s blessing,” was a

Mendev and the Sarkoris Scar were
dotted with battlefield graves where

Clarethe was the first knight to swear the Crimson Oath, and the only one to know the source of its power, despite the curiosity and concerns of the rest of the Knights of Lastwall. Many suspect the Crimson Reclaimer regularly visits this force in secret, though despite multiple attempts, no one has managed to catch Clarethe in the act. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.069,r=0.365,b=0.237), with ID c48b6f5a-6076-4825-8dd7-9bf6dff99053 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a heavily armored knight wielding a glowing red sword, with ornate armor and a dramatic cape, set against a decorative background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a knight in full black and gold plate armor with elaborate, spiked pauldrons and a sun emblem on the chest.
  • The knight holds a glowing red sword in the left hand, with a purple-red cape flowing behind.
  • The setting is stylized and fantastical, with a partial view of a stone pillar and decorative gold elements on the left edge.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with red highlights and shadows accentuating the armor's contours.
  • The color palette is dominated by black, gold, red, and purple hues.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • No visible text overlays or UI elements on the illustration itself.
  • The armor features intricate gold filigree and a sunburst motif.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The knight is centered and occupies most of the frame, standing in a confident pose.
  • The sword is held diagonally across the body, with the cape billowing to the left.
  • The background is mostly white with some decorative elements on the left.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of power, authority, and fantasy heroism, emphasizing the knight's imposing presence and ornate equipment.
  • The use of glowing red and gold highlights draws attention to the weapon and armor, suggesting magical or supernatural qualities. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.002,t=0.253,r=0.436,b=0.941), with ID c825908d-fcd6-4ee4-8ce7-6feed7991a19 -->

Clarethe’s passions run hot indeed, and she feels grief, joy, and anger with equal
intensity. Unquestionably, she took the loss of her mother Gwyndria much harder
than Kalabrynne, and every knight knows Clarethe’s truest desire is to conquer
the ruins of Vigil. It is most likely this quest that led to the fiery argument between
her and her surviving mother, when Clarethe stormed from Vellumis with her most
ardent allies in tow. This, then, was the schism among the knights that led to the
formation of the Crimson Reclaimers. Since then the two Iomedars have made peace,
and the two orders are one again; family and order each now more tightly bound
than ever. Clarethe still prefers the field, though, for she is a creature of action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.078,r=0.917,b=0.219), with ID 6b4e5903-57d6-4b70-9233-cd45938ab0fd -->

Tales of the Sunset Angel are common among the Crimson Reclaimers and their
allies, each stranger than the last. A Varisian potion-brewer tells me Clarethe crosses
the Ustalavic border at each half-moon to court a maiden stitched together from
corpses and given life by lightning’s stroke, and that she occasionally sends knights
as couriers to her lady love, bearing gifts of grave-bloomed flowers and jewelry
of hammered meteor-iron that draws the lightning. Then there was the craggy orc
knight reclaimant with more scar than skin, who spoke enraptured of
how Clarethe sings to her bastard sword in battle; how it chants the
Crimson Oath in chorus with her; and how at times she seems to take
its counsel and sends knights far afield to counter unforeseen enemy
movements. Of these tales there is little proof; yet I say that a tale need not
be factual to be true, especially in dark and hopeless times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.219,r=0.917,b=0.403), with ID 886f6176-0c0b-41b4-8391-d6642c0e1544 -->

Patronage Veiled in Mystery  
Much has been made of the mysterious patron of the Reclaimers. I asked Clarethe about her patron one night, when the fires were burning low and only the sentries stood waking. For a few moments she considered her crimson brand, first of its kind; then, as much to the sword as to me, said, “Whether born of evil or reborn by evil, all creatures hold the spark of destiny in their hearts. I choose to judge others not by their birth, but by their deeds, for the latter are what mark the world.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.416,t=0.413,r=0.917,b=0.540), with ID ecc23411-551d-406f-adbd-7f6eaad7c70b -->

Then she winked at me, for she knew the nature of my birth and upbringing.
“Isn’t that so, Berry Veil?” she asked, ruffling my hair with her gauntleted
hand, and I was glad for the silver-blue veil of my hair to hide my cherry-
red cheeks. Clarethe often gives such deed-names (as her Iobarian forebears
sometimes call them) to her allies among the knights, from the celestial-
blooded archer and scout the reclaimers call Angel Eyes, to the diminutive
halfling she named Kneebane. I could glean nothing more of her patron, but
I can say with certainty this: Clarethe will suffer no evil, and she would break her
oath without hesitation if it led the Reclaimers into temptation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.399,t=0.541,r=0.915,b=0.677), with ID 5ef7eac6-6425-4a56-97c3-8416c66c5a65 -->

These are the Iomedars, mother and child. If they are not the leaders of the Knights of Lastwall, then they are surely the order’s twin hearts.

  • The altar is adorned with two bouquets (white and purple flowers), lit candles, a red cloth with gold fringe, and scattered jewelry or coins.
  • Behind the altar, three swords are displayed upright: a large broadsword on the left, a rapier on the right, and a central sword embedded in a stylized, green and blue shield or plaque.
  • The background features red and gold vertical banners, stone walls, and a decorative gold frame at the top edge.
  • The color palette is dominated by reds, golds, greys, and muted greens, with warm candlelight providing illumination.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • No visible text or inscriptions.
  • The illustration is highly stylized, with clean lines and a painterly digital art style.
  • The altar cloth is decorated with a string of pearls and various colored gems.

# FAMILY STORIES
While Kalabrynne and Clarethe’s relationship is no longer antagonistic, the two often cannot resist teasing each other.

**Clarethe’s Wolf:** Kalabrynne is fond of telling overly enthusiastic or impetuous squires the tale of how Clarethe, as a youthful squire of Lastwall, once tore bloody hell through the local garrison screaming for aid against a “werewolf,” which turned out to be one of the local rangers’ tame wolfhounds. Clarethe still has not lived the experience down. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.644,t=0.601,r=0.873,b=0.770), with ID edf5f015-26ec-4512-837d-86f6188b3af1 -->

Mother Hen: Perhaps as revenge for her mother Kalabrynne favorite story (never mind that she’s been telling this one longer), Clarethe takes every opportunity to tell overly cautious companions the long list of rules and warnings she had to endure from Kalabrynne during her childhood—a list which seems to grow with each new telling. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.643,t=0.770,r=0.874,b=0.926), with ID 7f997207-0ac3-4720-a290-628e3ffb59c7 -->

I want you to know, first, that I would still very much like to see you give a guest
lecture at the Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery—at least, some
day. Your credentials from over a dozen academies, as well as your many medical
breakthroughs, speak for themselves. If those were the only things speaking to your
name, that would be that. Yet though I know that it was I who approached you, I
must commit the grave offense of rescinding the invitation. The Peerless are not best
pleased by some of the things you have said in the past, particularly about Sarenrae.
While I know we are all people of our word, perhaps if you would walk some of these
statements back, I might be able to gain some traction? To call the Dawnflower “a
bloody killer in the guise of a healer, willing to murder an entire city rather than deign
to explain herself” seems particularly harsh, and not at all supported by the scripture. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.158,r=0.915,b=0.326), with ID 9d3f5941-2236-4307-93a8-4e6366336f0c -->

To the same concern, I would like to introduce your research on addiction to our
scholars to help combat the import of drugs, but they are having trouble seeing past
the foreword. You wrote, “The reason so many people misunderstand addiction
is that they see it as a personal mental failing. In truth, addiction is a disease tied
to the life force that gives us instincts like hunger or thirst. The gods intentionally
built mortals to be susceptible to addiction so we could be more easily deluded and
addicted to religion and faith, and it is through that vulnerability that drugs prey
upon us.” Is this theological aside within a medical text truly necessary? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.326,r=0.914,b=0.449), with ID 36d22f40-17fc-4d73-a899-85a213f87871 -->

Sometimes called the Mother of Medicine, Kassi Aziril’s stubborn insistence on relying on science and alchemy over the use of magical care for the sick and injured led her to a bevy of major discoveries that had been, until recently, ignored by the medical community, due to the much more available access to divine healing throughout most of the world. Yet in Rahadoum, where faith in the gods is persecuted, techniques like those pioneered by Kassi are literal lifesavers. With degrees from major universities across Golarion and an apprenticeship with Artokus Kirran, the precocious Kassi Elaran traveled the world to further refine her techniques. Discoveries like kandleare, a deep sea algae with astounding medicinal properties, led to further breakthroughs, and studies with other medical practitioners helped her cultivate kandleare in her laboratories. She returned to Rahadoum to focus on her research, periodically sharing reports or updates with other scholars or government agencies for peer reviews and the like. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.509,r=0.915,b=0.708), with ID 7f57a61a-52ad-4b47-ae65-929a42808660 -->

In 4708 AR, scholars in Taldor and Qadira plagiarized Kassi’s work on battlefield
medicine within 1 month of each other, each to great acclaim. The Rahadoum
government stepped in to protect Kassi’s original authorship, realizing the
potential for her discoveries. They asked her to generate a book-length report on
her medicine and then published it, ensuring that her work was not only properly
attributed to her, but also securing more control over it for the government. As
a further show of solidarity, she and her family were adopted into Rahadoum’s
prestigious Aziril clan, changing her name to Kassi Aziril. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.709,r=0.913,b=0.831), with ID 0e6cac63-5823-4478-99de-59e278ee6d60 -->

With greater support from the government, Kassi’s research and discoveries grew, yet her methods often proved difficult for others to replicate, in part due to Kassi’s unwillingness to make her kandlerae derivative available to the public. Her methods of administering battlefield medicine and her observations into the nature of disease have taken on lives of their own, however, with the methods being adopted more and more by soldiers, healers, scholars, and adventurers throughout the Inner Sea region. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.832,r=0.913,b=0.939), with ID ad10a173-173c-4005-83bd-4035f1f25d5d -->

Summary : This illustration compares the anatomy of a healthy human male with the effects of various fantasy creature-inflicted wounds, highlighting the medical concerns and treatment priorities for each type of injury.

illustration:
# Scene Overview :
  • Two full-body anatomical drawings of a human male, side by side.
  • Left figure shows normal anatomy with internal organs, veins, muscles, and skin.
  • Right figure shows the same body with various fantasy wounds and injuries, each labeled with descriptive text.
  • Background is parchment-like, with a fantasy-medical theme.

# Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification indicated.
  • Text annotations describe both normal anatomy and specific wound types.
  • Colour palette is muted, with flesh tones, reds, and browns.

# Left Figure : Healthy Anatomy
  • Labels highlight the net of veins, orifices, organs, bones, and muscles.
  • Notes the importance of skin, hair, and pores for overall body function.

# Right Figure : Wounded Anatomy
  • Piercing wounds from spider’s fangs, elemental spikes, manticore spines—advised not to remove until proper care is given.
  • Crushing injury from a constrictor serpent—emphasizes care for soft tissue and bone to reduce morbidity.
  • Piercing wound from a web lurker’s leg—risk of bone infection and systemic illness.
  • Cuts from a ghoul, shoggti, giant scorpion, lesser xulgath—loss of vital fluids is the first concern.
  • Wound contaminations—identification of poisons and venoms is critical; ghoul venom fades with time, other poisons may worsen.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Left figure is uninjured, right figure is overlaid with fantasy creature appendages and wounds.
  • Each wound is visually connected to a specific annotation.
  • Both figures are front-facing, standing upright, with arms slightly outstretched.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration contrasts normal human anatomy with the complex, multi-faceted dangers posed by fantasy creatures.
  • Emphasizes the need for specialized medical knowledge to treat magical or monstrous wounds, prioritizing removal of foreign objects, infection control, and management of toxins or venom.
  • The visual juxtaposition highlights the vulnerability of the human body to a variety of supernatural threats, and the importance of triage and wound assessment in such scenarios. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.072,r=0.864,b=0.472), with ID 4b464207-3a72-4704-9373-c6da38419db6 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a wooden bucket filled with water, aquatic plants, and purple-red floating vegetation, viewed from an elevated angle.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a rustic, round wooden bucket with visible wood grain and a metal band reinforcement.
  • The bucket is filled with water, partially covered by clusters of purple and red aquatic plants or algae.
  • Several long, thin green leaves or grass-like aquatic plants emerge vertically from the water.
  • The perspective is slightly above and to the side, showing the bucket’s rim and contents clearly.
  • The colour palette is dominated by natural browns (wood), metallic grey (band), vibrant purples and reds (plants), and green (leaves).
  • Lighting is even, with no strong shadows or highlights, suggesting diffuse illumination.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration style is semi-realistic, with visible brush strokes and stylized textures.
  • No background is visible; the bucket is isolated on a white or transparent background.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The bucket occupies the entire frame, with the rim forming a near-complete circle.
  • Aquatic plants are distributed across the water’s surface, with green leaves emerging at various angles.
  • The floating vegetation is concentrated near the rim, with some overlapping the edge.

Analysis :
  • The image emphasizes the rustic, natural appearance of the bucket and its aquatic contents.
  • The combination of vibrant plant colours and the wooden texture creates a visually appealing, organic composition.
  • The isolated presentation suggests the bucket and its contents are the sole focus, possibly for illustrative or game asset purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.053,r=0.370,b=0.287), with ID 41f528f7-568a-4ad5-8f87-28f559eebbc5 -->

## THE TRUTH ABOUT KANDLERAE
Key to many of Kassi’s breakthroughs was the rare algae known as kandlerae. She was introduced to the substance by Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid via a series of missives, but only recently has she started to suspect that his motives might be sinister. By helping her to develop methods of healing based on science rather than faith, the veiled master posing as Hashim hopes to further erode the very concept of faith itself, something very different than what Kassi hopes to accomplish. Now that Kassi has an inkling of the veiled master’s insidious schemes, whether or not its influence will play out the way it plans, only time will tell. Regardless, none can argue that what Kassi has accomplished has been anything but beneficial to her patients and the medical community at large. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.303,r=0.366,b=0.650), with ID 6e504b3b-0212-474c-927c-115e4ce75f42 -->

Addiction Suppressant  
The method of developing addiction suppressants are different than those for antiplague or vaccines. For every drug, a specific suppressant must be crafted—no generalized addiction suppressant yet exists. In order to create an addiction suppressant, you must begin with a dose of the drug to be suppressed, then use alchemical reagents to generate an elixir that can be used to fight that drug’s addiction. An addiction suppressant must be a higher level than the drug it is meant to suppress in order to work. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.154,r=0.905,b=0.281), with ID 3c58cc5f-51e5-48b7-81a7-0c6792e76253 -->

Kassi Aziril taught you her techniques that originated the modern use of Battle Medicine. When you successfully use Battle Medicine, you can also reduce the target's sickened, enfeebled, or clumsy condition by 1 (this has no effect if you are subject to an effect continually applying the clumsy condition, like enlarge). If you are legendary in Medicine, you can choose to reduce the target's frightened or stunned condition by 1 instead, and if you have the Godless Healing feat (Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide 56), you can choose to reduce the target's stupefied or drained condition by 1 instead. If you have the Mortal Healing feat, you can reduce all available conditions by 1 for a target who hasn't benefited from positive or healing magic in the last 24 hours, and if you roll a critical success before applying the effects of the feat, you reduce all available conditions by 2 for that target instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.719,r=0.917,b=0.940), with ID b833135a-20b4-4888-860a-faa8d7591304 -->

master Kirran,
  It has been some time since my last letter. Truthfully, so much has happened in so
little time. It seems that the world has been turned on its end for the last decade,
and the uncaring gods treat us all as pawns in their games. I pray you indulge an old
student, master. Perhaps it is I who have changed, no longer the girl journeying to
every school around the Inner Sea region and beyond to learn of medicine, but instead
putting those lessons into practice, traveling the world to heal those who needed me
most. And not all is darkness. This new world is also full of wonders grander than you
might imagine. I have hope that mortalkind can struggle and survive together, even with
so much arrayed against us. heroes have given me that hope. Each time it seemed like
the world heroes-not the gods-stood against all odds and triumphed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.132,t=0.113,r=0.810,b=0.279), with ID c0ce4bd2-68ca-45e2-b4c3-7760e889e7d5 -->

so much arrayed against us. heroes stood against all odds and triumphed.
all was lost, mortal heroes... the gods stood against all odds and triumphed.
It has made me realize something: even all those years ago, I knew I couldn’t simply stand by and research. But now I realize that traveling to triage the latest plague or disaster might be too reactive. And yet, I am needed for that! I realized I must foster students who can do what I am not able to accomplish alone. When we are young, we feel like we can not only do anything, but everything that needs to be done. Yet I can’t be everywhere—I’ve tried. Even now, I feel an urge to travel to New Thassilon and seek out lost medicine. The people of the past brought forward with them, though I think I must prioritize treatment of some of the uniquely suffering victims of the Whispering Tyrant. Truly, positive energy can be as horrifying and cancerous as negative energy is ruinous, both bent so often as tools of the gods. Either way I go, I am doing nothing to prevent the next big medical emergency.
But students... yes, students can be in two places at once, or more. Now I understand why you stayed in one place, hidden from all eyes. You knew that all along. I am sorry I accused you of caring only for Thuvia’s economy, all those years ago. I hope you will forgive me for taking so long to learn that lesson.
I write you for a more practical reason as well. While I know I spoke well of him in the past, I am beginning to detect something dangerous in Pastbroker ibn Sayid. Something more than mere greed. Something... wrong. when he calls in my favor, I think I am going to need to refuse it, and I am not sure what he’ll do next. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.258,r=0.831,b=0.574), with ID 290d1d08-e9fc-4c78-82b1-bcc1002a746b -->

I should be fine, but in case something happens to me, I hope that you’ll
close attention. I suspect he would pin the blame on Cheliax or one of the other
theocracies I’ve angered over the years. Who would think to look to my friends
when I have so many enemies?
  Don’t laugh, master. I know I am stubborn, but my belief in the laws of mortality
and the worth of all people are as strong and as pure as any cleric’s faith in a god,
only without the need to be bribed with magic first, and thus absent of the inherent
taintiness of that servitude. I can no more silence my conscience than you could <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.158,t=0.571,r=0.839,b=0.697), with ID d46ef55a-1d07-474e-b2e5-832012831559 -->

dearborn Thuvia.
I have enclosed all my research notes for unfinished projects. By the time you read this letter, I hope to have begun the search for students of my own to spread my methods, but in case of the worst, I must also ask you to see to it that this knowledge isn’t lost <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.169,t=0.693,r=0.844,b=0.770), with ID 5f5ec7a4-9d34-4260-941b-a1b46e4e69a6 -->

my honest,
knowledge isn’t lost.
  Here I am, always the pessimist, the realist, but I write to a man I’ve never seen with my own eyes, in full faith that he can and will take care of the important things in the worst circumstances. I’m sure you would tell me that’s the same kind of comfort the religious take when they think of their god. I have seen it so often on their faces, dying in certitude that their god has it all planned out, when really the gods are just waiting to absorb the souls of the faithful to build their divine realms. I am different. I have faith in the man, not the legend.
  Yours in truth,

## FAMILIAR FACES
Kevoth-Kul was encountered during the events of the Iron Gods Adventure Path. Though a dangerous and capricious figure, _Legends_ assumes that explorers from the Numerian town of Torch–as played by the PCs–managed to help the Black Sovereign shake free of his addictions and finally see how he had been manipulated by the Technic League. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.068,r=0.364,b=0.239), with ID 2ef2b7a5-6cdc-495c-ae88-814acfc22fff -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a muscular barbarian warrior holding a large sword with technological circuit-like patterns, dressed in fur and leather armor with metallic accents, standing in a heroic pose.

BLACK SOVEREIGN OF NUMERIA  
CN MALE HUMAN BARBARIAN  
From a young age, the Numerian warlord Kevoth-Kul showed impressive ambition, claiming leadership of the Black Horses clan in a trial of ordeals in 4687 AR. One year later, after conquering most of the neighboring lands, he was able to gain the willing alliance of several of Numeria’s other clans. It took 3 more years to win the cautious acceptance of the remaining clans, who began to believe that Kevoth-Kul could be a truly great leader that would unite the land of Numeria. Declaring the mysterious city of Starfall to be his capital, Kevoth-Kul crowned himself Black Sovereign in 4690 AR. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.105,r=0.915,b=0.249), with ID ad9b5397-fa2b-4ef3-a724-2b570b398140 -->

Yet his downfall began when he forged a tenuous alliance with the Technic League—a reclusive group of researchers obsessed with studying the highly advanced alien technological artifacts scattered across Numeria. Goaded by representatives of the Technic League, Kevoth-Kul took to consuming the strange otherworldly liquids known as Numerian fluids that drip and pool from the broken remnants of the crashed starship whose ruins dot his country. Kevoth-Kul drastically underestimated just how addictive Numerian fluids could be, and this act of hubris quickly gave way to an addiction that made him a puppet of the Technic League for well over 20 years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.249,r=0.914,b=0.372), with ID 92689b4e-37d1-4472-9654-8c47ec2080d5 -->

Under the sway of Numerian fluids, Kevoth-Kul fell into a decadent torpor, broken on occasion by violent rages, fugue states, and the increasingly rare bout of clearheaded rulership. The Technic League found it a relatively easy task to control the Black Sovereign in this state, using silvered words and subtle magical manipulations along with their seeming inexhaustible supply of Numerian drugs, ensuring their control of the nation in all but name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.401,t=0.372,r=0.914,b=0.464), with ID 1541ad5b-57c9-433f-af22-4ab811c316c5 -->

All that changed in 4716 AR with the death of Technic League leader **Ozmyn Zaidow** (CE male human technomancer) and the scattering of its remaining members. The events leading to the destruction of the Technic League resulted in Kevoth-Kul shaking free of the addiction that ruled him for decades. Realizing how badly he’d been used by his allies, the Black Sovereign succumbed to a rage, slaughtering the remnants of the Technic League who were foolish enough to stay within his reach. Over the next several weeks, Kevoth-Kul withdrew to his personal chambers, free of his physical dependencies but still fighting off the mental toll of his addictions. He allowed few to see him until he returned to his throne, refusing to speak of his time under the effects of Numerian fluids. For all intents and purposes, he acted as if the previous quarter-century had never occurred. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.409,t=0.463,r=0.915,b=0.647), with ID 2128c3e8-b058-450f-b107-6f669d951cb8 -->

Kevoth-Kul is now a changed man. Though in his early fifties, Kevoth-Kul appears no older than 30 due to one of the side-effects of consuming Numerian fluids. Unknown to most, Kevoth-Kul is effectively immortal, freed from death save by violence, poison, or disease. Unfortunately, while many of the physical side effects were beneficial, unpleasant mental consequences also linger. Kevoth-Kul’s behavior is occasionally erratic, and there is much he saw in his drug-induced visions that has given him unique insight, but still haunts his waking hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.490,t=0.648,r=0.916,b=0.801), with ID 1cb68d8c-8e38-4d8d-b65e-859fc420c261 -->

Kevoth-Kul’s palace remains a place of
debauchery, with one crucial exception: Numerian
fluids are banned on the premises. Kevoth-Kul
has been known to personally execute anyone
caught violating this edict. Similarly, anyone so
foolish as to claim allegiance to the Technic
League, or to be known as a former member,
has nothing to look forward to at the palace other
than a violent death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.588,t=0.799,r=0.917,b=0.940), with ID 6c67f854-9b72-4f57-b65f-10d46ed56687 -->

# REFORGING A SHATTERED FUTURE
The residents of Starfall now watch Kevoth-Kul with a wary eye, uncertain of the ruler’s next move. Though the Black Sovereign has made some token moves to undo the cruelty he had inflicted on his people during his descent into hedonism, he still brooks little challenge to his authority, and years of being subject to his capricious whims have eroded any trust or respect he might have won in his earlier days. Kevoth-Kul keeps his thoughts to himself, having learned the price of relying on the counsel of others. As a result, few can claim to understand the motives behind his actions, as they could as easily be some manner of far-reaching plan as they could be a product of one of Kevoth-Kul’s erratic mood swings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.074,r=0.618,b=0.234), with ID 135211dd-049a-4643-ae36-0c1448bcac61 -->

In one of his more curious moves, Kevoth-Kul recently sent Chancellor Irahai
of Mendev a beautiful scimitar made of an alloy of cold iron and the skymetal
noqual—Kevoth-Kul personally developed this alloy, naming it “sovereign steel.”
While Irahai gratefully accepted the gift, she also recognized she was not familiar
enough with Kellid traditions to be certain what hidden meaning might have been
behind the exchange. Researching the matter with other Kellid clans has been
of little help, as such an act could be potentially interpreted by different clans as
either a marriage proposal, an offer of fealty, or an act of war. So far, Kevoth-Kul
has deferred any further explanation. The unique alloyed blade, with its hypnotic
acid-etched surface, remains his only message. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.234,r=0.616,b=0.387), with ID 31dbd0d7-da81-49de-a651-860f3efa4dd0 -->

Despite Kevoth-Kul’s bloody purge of the Technic League, the capital of Starfall has
become a haven for at least one survivor of that shattered organization. The scarred
gnome Khismar Crookchar has managed to hide his former allegiances, pretending
to be a victim and experiment of the Technic League. As Khismar has proved adept
at rooting out other members of the Technic League for Kevoth-Kul to personally
execute, the gnome has currently won the Black Sovereign’s favor. Khismar has also
provided Kevoth-Kul with a number of petrified heads of former Technic League
captains, which Kevoth-Kul keeps in a pile in his throne hall. Khismar is playing a
dangerous game, however, and should Kevoth-Kul ever discover the gnome’s true
loyalties, Khismar’s end would be swift and brutal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.387,r=0.615,b=0.540), with ID 80702f4b-bc13-4ced-b158-e2d6156e5c51 -->

In addition to the Technic League’s victims, Kevoth-Kul welcomed androids
into his service with open arms. Many androids are also victims of the Technic
League, or otherwise have their own reasons to despise it, and a good number have
knowledge on how to use advanced technology, making them a solid replacement for
the Technic League’s expertise. Some of these androids have become Kevoth-Kul’s
personal honor guard, while others teach their Kellid counterparts how to utilize
technology or join bands of hunters who scour Numeria in hopes of rooting out
Technic League agents who have thus far evaded their fate. A small number have
instead traveled north to do battle with the demons of the Sarkoris Scar, easing some
of the Blades of Aaramor’s burden of defending the nation’s border. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.540,r=0.615,b=0.693), with ID 7b1f2f7d-2f91-44ea-9f9b-f3ccf483ce45 -->

Even these new allies have little idea what Kevoth-Kul is currently planning. Rumors abound that the Black Sovereign, now free of his addiction, may return to his plans for conquering Numeria. Yet this prospect is far less appealing after over 20 years of erratic behavior and cruelty—the once great image of Kevoth-Kul is tarnished; likely beyond repair. Kevoth-Kul’s revenge on the Technic League also earned him many more powerful enemies, as survivors of the League have found refuge under other Numerian warlords, taking their stockpiles of advanced technology with them. Any move to turn Numeria into a single nation and a power on the world stage will face far more resistance than it did in Kevoth-Kul’s prime. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.694,r=0.615,b=0.831), with ID fa5440bb-060a-4292-a6ea-9d3305c519d8 -->

Kevoth-Kul currently has several short-term goals, primarily focusing on shoring up the losses to his political might. While Starfall and much of Sovereign’s Reach remains <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.832,r=0.615,b=0.863), with ID 804a8833-ae83-4040-b866-99e6dd392f03 -->

# PALACE OF FALLEN STARS
Kevoth-Kul rules from the keep of the Black Sovereign in Starfall—a slick, high-walled compound surrounded by squat defense towers and capped with an immense metal dome. The palace interior contains a vibrant environment that leaps between the crude and the cosmopolitan in a way that is jarring to many visitors. Chained skeletons, free-roaming exotic pets, and gruesome piles of skulls and other trophies mingle alongside luxurious baths, libraries, electric lights, and the highly advanced technological constructs known as gearsmen that serve as guards. The keep is usually in a state of constant revelry, with harried chefs providing meals and alcohol for feasts at all hours; demands for entertainment see a number of acrobats and storytellers present in the palace at all times, and guests have access to enough drug paraphernalia to put the finest Chelaxian parlors to shame. The recent influx of android residents and the Black Sovereign’s newfound aversion to addictive substances has ushered in a more temperate atmosphere of late, though not by much. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.639,t=0.073,r=0.877,b=0.559), with ID 1705d3e2-24eb-4de2-bf41-497621a27302 -->

# NOQUAL
Noqual is a type of skymetal—an extremely rare metal that originated from distant planets and dead stars.  
Scarce even compared to other skymetals, noqual appears as pale-green crystals but can be forged like metal into equipment as strong as—but lighter than—iron. Noqual also exhibits magic-resistant properties, which makes crafting magic weapons from the skymetal expensive and difficult, a trait sovereign steel appears to avoid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.071,r=0.365,b=0.267), with ID ba32747b-2945-4ee7-8c55-4a08e75c56d9 -->

firmly in his grasp, areas further beyond have begun slipping toward a form of semi-
independence, a development Kevoth-Kul seeks to rectify. In particular, the Black
Sovereign would like to see that the city of Chesed—and by extension, its material
wealth and influence in regional trade—remains in his own hands. Kevoth-Kul is
aware that the city of Hajoth Hakados remains his nation’s most accessible port
for purloined technology and hopes to convince its ruler, **Lady Altouna** (NG female
lashunta wizard), that the two of them would benefit more as allies than as enemies.
While hesitant, Altouna is weighing Kevoth-Kul’s offers of protection against her
current reliance on the violent Kellid Blood Gars clan, and may be amenable to forging
a deal if she believes the Black Sovereign can prove himself reliable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.079,r=0.917,b=0.234), with ID eed1aaea-03d7-4896-b8c5-ae77708459b5 -->

Domestically, the rebellious clans in western Numeria pose a threat to trade and
stability across the country—Kevoth-Kul requires loyal agents able to turn them to his
side, bring them to heel or, if necessary, send a message that active instigation isn’t in
their best interests. Kevoth-Kul’s new edicts have proven unpopular with several clans,
particularly the technology-loathing Ghost Wolves. The Ghost Wolves’ chieftain,
**Xol-Nomag** (CN female human barbarian), is herself one of the more powerful figures
in Numerian politics, and finds Kevoth-Kul’s cozying up to settled Kellids, androids,
and outsiders nearly as much of an outrage as his apparent embrace of forbidden
technologies. Kevoth-Kul has mostly ignored the situation, but if tensions persist, it’s
only a matter of time before Kevoth-Kul and Xol-Nomag go to war. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.235,r=0.915,b=0.387), with ID 044bb76e-4f10-4d8a-9c99-ad1b873f3539 -->

Some believe Kevoth-Kul’s long-term ambition is no less than the unification of every Kellid clan, Numerian or otherwise, into a single great empire. By most estimates, this plan would be nigh impossible to implement, but Kevoth-Kul is learning the value of patience—as an immortal, he has literally all the time in the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.387,r=0.915,b=0.449), with ID 7af11183-32d1-44d8-9610-7113ddf1f1f7 -->

KUL-INKIT  
Kevoth-Kul’s consort and second-in-command, **Kul-Inkit** (CN female human barbarian), lost any affection for him out of disgust for his drug-fueled hedonism. His recent turn around in behavior has managed to rekindle her interest, if not her passion, and though she is still reluctant to spend time with him, she seems to wholeheartedly support his current goals. She has become a devout believer in Casandalee as proof that technology is key to Numeria’s future. Kul-Inkit is one of the few aware of Kevoth-Kul’s immortality and hopes to find a way to join him as perpetual corulers of a unified Kellid nation. To this end, she has made quiet inquiries via trusted agents about acquiring some of Thuvia’s famed sun orchid elixir, immortality through genie wishcraft, and her preferred method: uploading her consciousness into a construct. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.459,r=0.915,b=0.663), with ID 59756eff-e684-4ce3-9f25-4561e74a1f30 -->

SOVEREIGN STEEL

RARE  PRECIOUS

Created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, this unique alloy of cold iron and the skymetal noqual can provide protection from magical assault. The process of cold-forging the two materials together is quite complicated and precise. Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.073,r=0.619,b=0.264), with ID 1ab109b2-1533-4a00-8b8f-66ea36f70ae4 -->

# THE IRON GODDESS
Guided by some of his troubled visions, Kevoth-Kul took to making forays into Silver Mount, fighting off its numerous threats and discovering rare technologies along the way. It was during one of these excursions that he became aware of the risen android-turned-AI-turned-goddess, Casandalee. Never a particularly spiritual man, Kevoth-Kul was still awed by the goddess’ divine ascension and thinks of her as an inspiring and guiding figure for his new reign. Few nations can make claim to an immortal ruler guided by an immortal goddess native to that realm, and that Numeria has produced both is–in Kevoth-Kul’s mind, at least–testament to its <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.326,r=0.888,b=0.669), with ID be6c621f-756e-42a0-9752-64a692ef5507 -->

grand destiny.
Kevoth-Kul brought word of Casandalee to the palace, having the abandoned chapel to Zyphus (an evil god of accidental death) that was originally installed by the Technic League’s Black Seers rededicated to the Iron Goddess. Casandalee has proven popular with the palace residents—certainly more so than Zyphus ever was—and in particular with Kevoth-Kul’s consort Kul-Inkit, who has taken to Casandalee’s faith with zeal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.661,t=0.664,r=0.887,b=0.884), with ID 21bec192-d508-4af2-9242-7395fc484da9 -->

NE MALE GNOME ALCHEMIST  
*However Khismar manages to retain the favor of the Black Sovereign in the fallout of Casandalee’s ascension, it is obvious he’s poisoned the well for any of his former colleagues within the borders of Starfall. As surviving remnants and other salvagers notice the Blue Streak’s growing technological monopolization, they pursue more obscure leads, diligently hiding the technology they find. Some such technology hunters risk their lives for the archaeological significance of their finds rather than value or personal gain. Yet after a few technology archaeologists went missing, those who remained understood that their academic motives did not forgive their actions in the eyes of their competition. They now hire bodyguards; their families hire search parties.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.381,t=0.127,r=0.919,b=0.295), with ID c533ebcb-374b-4189-ae23-255a624e2062 -->

For all of the unusual Numerian features the Rain of Stars caused, the fog across the Lake of Mists and Veils is not one. It occurs naturally, and the thickness of the fog depends on the patterns of the weather. This recent dry season, the fog thinned enough for the lake’s southwestern shallows to be visible. The buzz around Starfall quickly turned to the report of dozens of headless statues below the water’s surface. “Was this once dry land?” “Were they sculpted after specific people? If so, given their modern and futuristic accoutrement, were they connected to the Divinity, the starship that crashed in Numeria nearly ten millennia ago?” To those who never saw the Technic League, the significance of the missing heads presents an unsolvable mystery—but those of us who recognize an old colleague’s clothing might come to an obvious solution. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.295,r=0.917,b=0.464), with ID e20d2993-c969-47d5-8c94-f887d7528505 -->

# THE TECH RAT
With electric blue streaks through his black hair, laser-precise facial scars, and bioluminescent eyes and veins, Khismar Crookchar has been forever marked by Numeria. Likewise, Numeria’s landscape changed when this gnome scientist <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.393,t=0.873,r=0.917,b=0.941), with ID acb47eae-4ba2-4052-86a9-944674411e33 -->

Members of the Technic League—an influential organization of spellcasters and other lore-seekers protective of Numeria’s technological secrets—had a derogatory nickname for their erstwhile collaborator Khismar Crookchar: the tech rat. For years, Crookchar evaded League surveyors thanks to an endless supply of an elixir known as hype, which allowed him to remain active during all hours. By the time Khismar was discovered, he’d studied Numerian technology so extensively that he deftly used weapons known for their unpredictability against the League members who stumbled across him. He was presented to **Captain Zernebeth** (CN female human cyborg) as “salvage.” The leader of the Technic League saw more value in the gnome as a member than a slave and brought Crookchar in as an initiate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.111,r=0.615,b=0.263), with ID ae15a4aa-c110-4542-b75b-4652915467c6 -->

Crookchar never rose above that rank. He would have found himself ejected into the wastelands or worse if he wasn’t supplying hype to Technic League officers with uncharacteristic consistency. Not just the standard hype available across Starfall—his continued development of the formula meant his often replicated and synthesized original recipe was rapidly rendered obsolete by Khismar’s newest innovations. He shared his cutting-edge variant, called plasma hype, with his superior officers and select competitive members of the Technic League looking for an edge. Any Technic League relationships Crookchar nurtured were purely for his own benefit—those who believed in the League’s goals particularly resented Crookchar for abusing resources and supplying drugs to their officers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.265,r=0.615,b=0.417), with ID eb3eab38-c62b-4a67-9d3c-88d069bd5127 -->

Crookchar was always his own best customer, chasing plasma hype for days until passing out for an equal amount of time or longer. When he woke, he countered his tiredness with another cycle of energy dosing. Side effects of his hype abuse resulted in the brightening of his hair, skin, veins, and irises, and a web-like pattern on his fingernails and teeth. For most users, these side effects were subtle and temporary. Crookchar used plasma hype so frequently that he permanently altered his physiology. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.419,r=0.614,b=0.511), with ID 09110cfd-255e-4a98-bf5c-c947667d4013 -->

# UNLIKELY ALLIES
When the Technic League disbanded and most of the officers were killed in 4716 AR, the remaining members were mostly made up of those with ill will toward the tech rat. Crookchar found out the hard way how unpopular he was with the lower-ranking remnants of the League. He survived regular threats to his life thanks to being underestimated, combined with an unlikely guardian. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.522,r=0.613,b=0.616), with ID e112dcfe-2ad2-4a0c-88e7-97e47c58310e -->

Gawta (LE female medusa), a hype-using medusa from a cave near Starfall, had noticed the quality and availability of her pharmaceutical of choice had diminished. She investigated, leading her to Crookchar’s trail. As her kind interacted minimally with non-medusas, Gawta observed him from dunes and shadows, the only evidence of her presence being the occasional appearance of a petrified would-be assassin. When Crookchar finally discovered his unexpected protector, he made Gawta a deal: he would supply her with regular shipments of plasma hype, leaking word of delivery to suspected Technic League remnants. She petrified the remnants that pursued the rumors, delivered their stone heads to Khismar, and disposed of their bodies in the nearby Lake of Mists and Veils. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.617,r=0.614,b=0.770), with ID f90b134e-801f-42c3-bfd0-6e451347477f -->

Crookchar took the heads to Numeria’s Kellid ruler, the Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul. His intent was to use them as a threat and establish an arrangement similar to what the Technic League had with the hedonistic, ambivalent ruler.

Ozmyn Zaidow (CE male human technomancer)’s spirit fled his mind before the alien AI Unity neutralized it. Rumor is his ghost haunts Numeria with a vendetta against machines.

*Venom Immunization Post Mortem*
Ultimately, my hypothesis was disproved. Any similarities between a medusa’s serpentine aspects and a comparable serpentine species are coincidental. Neon garter’s venom proved impotent: only measurable effects 1 qt produced were mild cognitive impairment and moderate indigestion. Proper immunization requires direct source sample. Cognitive impairment too low to be worth developing as a weapon or to merit development for entertainment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.071,r=0.363,b=0.283), with ID 18f6c127-3c0e-45ea-8d3b-da9e49fdfd56 -->

Technic League experimentation before offering the Black Sovereign the heads as a tribute. Kevoth-Kul took a liking to this curious glowing man who offered up his beheaded enemies unsolicited. He promised Crookchar honored standing among his tribe as long as Kevoth-Kul was regularly presented with Technic League remnants, or their remains. Taking this as a threat, Crookchar agreed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.080,r=0.915,b=0.157), with ID 129a9e8c-1f4d-46ca-984c-4d75143d444d -->

Crookchar now does his best to live up to his side of the bargain. Occasionally this takes the form of intel on Technic League agents, but usually they are delivered in person, either whimpering and babbling due to a system full of hallucinogens or as a severed head turned to stone. Crookchar’s relationship with the Black Sovereign’s court allows him greater freedom to explore Numeria than most, granting him access to Numerian tech deep in Kellid territory and to Kevoth-Kul’s resources. Although Crookchar takes full advantage of this relationship, it causes him constant anxiety. He knows the truth behind the lies that won Kevoth-Kul’s favor could come to light, spelling certain death for the gnome. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.158,r=0.914,b=0.295), with ID bb3b8485-b792-4e2c-b6b6-b568bd8350ab -->

# POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
When the remnants stopped falling for the Gawta gambit, Crookchar began actively hunting them. Occasionally, his quarries didn’t present threats to him. If they had useful skills, he offered to spare them in exchange for their loyalty. Eventually he amassed a large group of technologically savvy minions. He dubbed them the Blue Streaks, after his electric-blue hair and the similarly hued stripes on Gawta’s scales. The Blue Streaks helped Crookchar secure Numerian technology, eliminated Crookchar’s enemies, and covered up Crookchar’s other activities. It wasn’t long before those Technic League members who knew Crookchar personally were all dealt with, leaving a growing number of remnants who know him only by reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.374,t=0.305,r=0.915,b=0.493), with ID a90fd2f9-8991-4d58-88ab-c4baaa375dae -->

The closest Crookchar has come to having a friend is his accomplice Gawta the medusa. While he trusts her with his thoughts and truths, he does so because he knows her hype addiction ensures her loyalty. To cope with her dangerous gaze, they always meet in blackout hoods. Crookchar makes a point of bringing a sedated newt on his shoulder when he meets with Gawta; a sudden shift in weight where the animal rests would alert him that Gawta’s veil has lifted and his life is at risk. Similarly, he only communicates with her in writing to set up meetings, and any writing they exchange is coded. Whenever Gawta confronts him on his paranoia, Crookchar points to the Blue Streaks being named after them both as indication of how highly he regards her. In truth, naming the Blue Streaks in part after the medusa’s blue markings on her red scales was for plausible deniability. If the secret group is ever discovered, he will paint her as the group’s sole leader—after killing Gawta and the rest of his minions, of course. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.495,r=0.914,b=0.693), with ID 1f8dd24a-2616-48a1-85fa-6fe1bbe7e6ce -->

Despite his standing in the Black Sovereign’s court, his relationship with Gawta, and his loyal followers, Crookchar cares only about his own goals. His multiple plots and the constant threats to his life forced his mind to finally focus on what mattered to him: survival and science. His newfound determination, along with his supply of potent pharmaceuticals, work to spread his influence across Numeria and beyond. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.694,r=0.914,b=0.771), with ID 95ff4f61-d33f-487a-bc71-265d443e7788 -->

# SECRETS OF THE BLUE STREAKS
Khismar’s greatest accomplishments are alchemical in nature and his willingness to push the limits of ethics for the sake of his experiments has paid dividends. The following are some of his more notable developments. He only shares the formulas for these items with his trusted apprentices, and even then, only grudgingly so. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.782,r=0.913,b=0.862), with ID 8c664707-dff0-4754-abc3-50cef911ad9d -->

ALCHEMICAL ATOMIZER                                            ITEM 10

Khismar developed this unique atomizer that allows for the distribution of elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. The atomizer can hold a single elixir, oil, or potion. An atomizer contains enough reagents to use it up to 10 times before the reagents must be replaced. A new batch of reagents costs 5 gp and requires an Interact action to replace.  
**Activate** ![figure: black diamond with white arrow] Interact; **Effect** You spray the contents of the atomizer on yourself or an adjacent willing ally or unattended object. The target gains the effects of the applied elixir, oil, or potion. The target must be a valid target for the effect, such as food or drink for a nectar of purification, or the consumable is lost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.076,r=0.621,b=0.203), with ID a885ad43-af20-431a-bb03-a8026463e2f6 -->

**Activate** ![icon: two black diamond shapes] Interact; **Effect** You cause the atomizer to mix its reagents and fire its held consumable at a square within 30 feet. The consumable forms a cloud that fills the space. The first willing valid target to enter the space automatically gains the effect of the consumable. If there are multiple valid targets, such as with multiple weapons for _aligned oil_, the creature entering the space determines how the effect is applied. The cloud is consumed upon contact with a willing valid target or at the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.203,r=0.620,b=0.313), with ID 5fdec614-27f1-49dd-a341-62e8652d9898 -->

**Hype**  
Crookchar’s most popular and profitable development is the energizing drug hype. Although Crookchar is constantly working to improve on his formula for hype, his older formula has since become replicated and more widespread. Diluted hype is common in the city of Starfall in Numeria. Hype uses the rules for drugs, found on pages 120–121 of the *Gamemastery Guide*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.322,r=0.619,b=0.421), with ID a7f401b1-b32b-465a-812a-51425464402c -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing two goblin-like creatures riding a large, monstrous, boar-like animal with exaggerated features. The scene is dynamic and action-oriented, with the goblins wielding weapons and wearing makeshift armor.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subjects are two green-skinned goblin creatures with large ears, sharp teeth, and red eyes.
  • The front goblin wears a helmet made from an animal skull and holds a club; the rear goblin wears a metal helmet and wields a curved dagger.
  • Both goblins are riding a large, pinkish, boar-like beast with two sets of tusks, a spiked collar, and a snarling expression.
  • The composition is energetic, with the goblins leaning forward as if charging or attacking.
  • The color palette is dominated by greens, pinks, and browns, with high contrast and cartoonish exaggeration.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The goblins' armor and weapons appear improvised, with the front goblin's helmet fashioned from a skull and the rear goblin's helmet made of metal.
  • The boar-like creature has prominent spikes, warts, and exaggerated anatomical features.

Spatial Relationships :

She watched as the visitor slowly made his way across the waiting room and gave a reassuring wave when he looked nervously back at her one last time. It was only when he had exited into the immense cavern beyond and the door had closed that she acknowledged her other guest. “All right, you, c’mon in.

# KNOWN HISTORY
These four goblin troublemakers began life in the Licktoad tribe, in a small village, in a small swamp, in a small corner of Golarion, on the Material Plane. How they got from there to here is a tale of violence, destruction, and an uncanny amount of good fortune for the goblins themselves. Goblin history is hard to come by, writing being a terrible sin to them and all, but I’ve managed to piece together a little bit of it for you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.198,r=0.532,b=0.325), with ID 92dc6453-fca2-4d09-bb83-dc5cf8824be2 -->

Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta made a name for
themselves at a young age by raiding a wedding, eating the cake,
and stealing a piglet (more on the pig shortly). Once established
as warriors for their tribe, they were free to cause all sorts
of trouble. One particularly daring and destructive raid left a
notorious goblin cannibal dead and the four returning to their
tribe as conquering heroes with a load of fireworks. Alas, the explosive fun
was not to last long for the Licktoads—the tribe was wiped out shortly afterward
by adventurers from a nearby human settlement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.326,r=0.610,b=0.464), with ID 9057e79d-24b6-4a55-b3d0-c819e7eb85dc -->

Even when luck ran out for the tribe, though, it held strong for this destructive quartet, who managed to be away on a mission at the time. They quickly found a new home with a nearby tribe, the Birdcrunchers, who just so happened to be in want of some heroes to take care of a pesky ogre problem. They drove off the interloping monster and his fire-breathing pigs, and even managed to rescue their former tribe’s prized mascot, a war-pig named Squealy Nord—you guessed it, the very one they stole as whelps. On their return they were crowned chieftains and settled in for the life of luxury they knew they deserved. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.465,r=0.613,b=0.585), with ID 935a0be4-0fff-446a-8c5a-7752dd5b90ec -->

This, too, was not to last. Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta were bored by life as chiefs—ordering raids is much less fun than participating in them, it seems. Thus, when their favorite pig disappeared into a mysterious magic bag, they jumped right in after him. They found themselves in a strange demiplane resembling the inside of a huge bag, accidentally created by and inhabited by the son of one of their early victims. After rescuing Squealy Nord—now alchemically altered into a large porcine dragon—they pierced the side of the bag and were dumped along with the rest of its contents onto the Astral Plane. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.587,r=0.614,b=0.708), with ID ae5d241f-eacd-4e67-a3d8-3f01066c9ccb -->

As always seems to be the case, their luck was astoundingly good. Rather than
get lost in the immeasurable and featureless expanse of the plane, they stumbled
almost immediately onto our fair city. We know they were here for a while, at
least, because they were chased out of the Preserve after a “misunderstanding”
regarding the flammability and edibility of the lichen gardens. Rumor has it
Barberstone Spa took the unusual step of completely draining and thoroughly
scrubbing their big pool the other day as well, though they’re being tight lipped
about it, and I can’t help but think that’s related. Given the recent uptick in theft
and vandalism in the area, as well as rumors of strange pirates attacking passersby,
it seems likely they’re still here. I suspect they’re hiding out down in Underpeak,
staring at that beautiful view of the Plane of Fire and plotting their next mischief.
It’s hard to know exactly what they’re planning, but given their history it will
probably involve the violent acquisition of something shiny, flammable, or both.
It shouldn’t be too hard to track them down, but be careful when you do; they’re
tougher than they look! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.710,r=0.614,b=0.938), with ID 15b88b17-c30d-40e2-a6a6-2d321973e3c8 -->

FARMERS OF THE BELLFLOWER NETWORK  
CG FEMALE AND MALE HALFLING ROGUE  
For a society such as the Bellflower Network, its members rely on secrecy, and none more so than the Farmer. As the figure serving as the head of this abolitionist organization, concealing the Farmer’s identity is paramount. If a Farmer is captured alive and forced to reveal information, the network would collapse. Diplomatic relationships across Golarion would likely follow, as it would reveal every nation that clandestinely supports the Bellflowers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.153,r=0.915,b=0.279), with ID 857b8dc6-278f-4c60-9b99-4d3d4c42ab12 -->

But the current Farmer has worked to limit the damage should such an event occur, for at the moment, there isn’t one Farmer, but two. Magdelena and Martum Fallows are twins who have worked undercover for the past few years, ensuring that halfling slaves across Cheliax are given every chance to experience freedom. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.281,r=0.914,b=0.342), with ID c96e3b20-0c3a-49c3-b518-addeb10fcc23 -->

EARLY YEARS  
Years ago, a young halfling named Hamir Fallows fell in love with Mariana Covon, a slave serving a sentence for thievery in central Cheliax. When their courtship began, Hamir was free, while Mariana served a cruel mistress named Madam Parisa. Soon, Mariana was expecting, and Hamir decided that the life of a slave was no life for his love or his future child. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.354,r=0.913,b=0.448), with ID 1f4e3d14-d9e3-418c-a7d9-b91b88725700 -->

Hamir attempted to earn Mariana’s freedom, even offering to pay Madam
Parisa a great amount, far more than the value of a halfling slave in Cheliax. Parisa
did not accept any terms Hamir proposed, however, and Chelaxian law was of no
assistance to Hamir. He eventually grew desperate and infiltrated Madam Parisa’s
estate in an attempt to liberate Mariana. The attempt was an outright failure.
Hamir faced off with Parisa’s guards, and the fight culminating in a great fire in
Madam Parisa’s manor. From cellar to roof, the estate went up in flames,
and neither Hamir nor Parisa were ever heard from again. Mariana was
quickly captured and transferred to a new owner to continue her sentence.
Several months later, Mariana gave birth to twins she named Magdelena
and Martum. Born into slavery, their new master took a semblance of pity
and permitted them to remain together. In childhood, Magdelena exhibited an
aptitude for nimbleness like her mother, while Martum seemed the spitting image
of a father they never knew. Together, they contributed to the fulfillment of their
mother’s sentence, adding their years to her time served. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.449,r=0.914,b=0.676), with ID 35059cf2-7f11-45b0-b1dd-6be8bcae4d84 -->

# HARVEST MOON
After their mother’s master died from a local plague, a nephew of their deceased master inherited the twins and promptly rewrote the terms of their enslavement. Instead of serving the Fallows family sentence concurrently, each of them had to serve the years separately. This effectively doubled their remaining sentence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.691,r=0.913,b=0.769), with ID ffdbee0e-7ddb-44b0-b2da-cb40c3a3129f -->

News of this legal trickery soon reached the ears of the Bellflower Network, who began observing the plantation. Early reports described the young Magdelena as a natural hunter, but predisposed to thieving, while Martum learned how to manage the plantation finances. Both got along well with their fellow halflings but harbored a burning hate for their owner. At age 14, agents witnessed an escape attempt that ended in the twins’ capture and punishment. These reports quickly reached Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist), who investigated the matter and learned something surprising: her deceased nephew, Hamir Fallows, was the father of the twins. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.771,r=0.913,b=0.907), with ID 5208794a-23f3-435f-984a-37d8fe47913c -->

As their grandaunt, Hannelore personally undertook the task of freeing them.

Martum in the dead of night and promised to lead them to safety. They accepted and disembarked on their Harvest Moon—the beginning of their road to freedom. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.077,r=0.617,b=0.115), with ID e3d422d5-bcbe-40e1-83fd-0a94ae4c5eeb -->

## BECOMING THE FARMER
After their escape from the plantation, Farmer Hannelore helped the twins flee all the way to the Cheliax border. On their own merit, Magdelena and Martum avoided capture multiple times, and Hannelore became a parental figure along the way. However, she never revealed to them that she was their grandaunt, fearing that their familial connection could compromise the Bellflower Network. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.122,r=0.617,b=0.219), with ID 7ef69149-2a51-4035-8835-be0d7fee0ce9 -->

When the pair reached the Aspodell Mountains on their way to Andoran, yet another surprise awaited them: a crop of halflings who’d been captured by Chelaxian patrols, their Bellflower agent handler killed. Together, they neutralized the patrol, and by the end of the night, the twins were leading their very first crop to freedom.

After this incident, Hannelore knew that her nephew’s twins seemed fated to aid the Bellflower Network. When they approached her to join up, she happily accepted, and together, the three of them returned to Cheliax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.220,r=0.616,b=0.324), with ID 503572b6-1218-4848-b470-85fd28279b5f -->

As the years passed, both Magdelena and Martum proved to be prodigies. At night, no challenge couldn’t be overcome by Magdelena, while Martum’s sliver tongue could talk him out of any situation. These talents turned them into underground folk heroes, earning Magdelena the alias of “Belltower,” and Martum the alias of “Sunflower.” Both of them would eventually partake in the rebellion that freed Ravounel from Chelaxian control, cementing this legend among halflings across the continent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.327,r=0.615,b=0.418), with ID 3258d802-3591-45d9-a0d4-ee978eedccff -->

But five years ago, Farmer Hannelore disappeared. Her allies feared her capture, but after two years passed and Bellflower operations continued without disruption, it’s assumed that an accident resulted in her death, her body never discovered. Although they are young, the Fallows twins have stepped up to lead the Bellflower Network in Hannelore’s place. In doing so, they are guiding the next generation of agents, and their aliases have generated tales of hope across the continent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.419,r=0.616,b=0.511), with ID 4d30bf94-5398-41c5-bfa0-127d69c8fb38 -->

# BELLFLOWER OPERATIONS
In their home country of Cheliax, Magdelena serves as the tactical mastermind of the operation. Her work has secured safe houses, enabled rebellions, and helped Bellflower agents spirit countless halfling slaves to freedom. Both home and abroad, Martum is the political agent, securing funds from rich and influential people who seek the end of slavery. They share the responsibilities of the Farmer well, though they haven’t been spotted in the same region for over a year. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.522,r=0.616,b=0.632), with ID b48ba3fe-5790-4658-8ac2-20baf9e3e22d -->

After having mixed success in Ravounel, the twins began to work apart and developed some bad habits on their own. Most notably, the emboldened Magdelena is taking unnecessary risks, while soft-spoken Martum is out of practice when it comes to freeing slaves in person. Their outlooks have changed too: Magdelena is hopeful that she’ll live to see the end of halfling enslavement, while Martum is a pragmatist and expects to serve as Farmer for the rest of his days. His increasing role as the face of the Bellflower Network is only encouraged by his sister. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.633,r=0.613,b=0.740), with ID 93a88116-638b-4f75-9f36-287306468026 -->

Today, as the Whispering Tyrant gains power, Magdelena constantly faces the dilemma of spiriting halflings out of Nidal. To the east, undead forces threaten every nation within the Eye of Dread. Some druidic or warrior halflings do request passage through Molthune to Nirmathas, but it’s a risky route that Magdelena loathes. Meanwhile, from afar, Martum has built a communication system with flowered quilts. Its colors and flower types allow agents to guide each other through locales that were once too dangerous, mitigating any risk with various warning signs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.741,r=0.613,b=0.847), with ID 4a8fc985-041d-46e8-ba9f-4889554a9b41 -->

# INSULT TO INJURY
In recent times, Ravounel has emerged as an independent and free nation, and during the rebellion, the twins established a strong Bellflower presence there together. Unfortunately, slave-hunters now earn steady incomes illegally by kidnapping and enslaving halflings—even ones who were never slaves to begin with. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.641,t=0.074,r=0.875,b=0.236), with ID 73759cdf-b768-4675-86fe-5285113d993f -->

# BELLFLOWER SAFE HOUSES
A number of safe houses, known as “barns” among members of the Bellflower Network, dot Cheliax. Ranging from abandoned barns to public taverns, each one possesses their own codeword for entry, which is known only to the agents that lead halflings in and out. Hosts, or “hands,” manage the hidden spaces where halflings eat, sleep, and wait for their next escort, or “tiller.” Some of the safe houses are listed below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.070,r=0.364,b=0.263), with ID aba4da43-bd7b-4281-b919-38d3ce106563 -->

One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain. Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.798,r=0.914,b=0.939), with ID 3e4cb744-66c7-4f9b-9520-82c1fcf021dc -->

LILY
Members of the Bellflower Network and their allies must often remain subtle when helping slaves escape. To aid in their efforts, the Bellflower Network has developed a system to deliver secret messages using quilts. These quilts bear specific designs to notify Bellflower tillers and those they guide of any important information. Members hang these quilts from porches, windows, and clotheslines where tillers and other travelers can see them. Most quilts bear flowers, as they are inconspicuous and are instantly recognizable to other Bellflower agents. A common pattern is that of the lily. The flower warns of an upcoming crossroads, which may be heavily traveled. The background pattern’s colors are used to indicate danger, with warmer colors suggesting higher risk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.484,r=0.274,b=0.947), with ID bc363765-7b16-4a23-a469-1815a530b410 -->

SUNFLOWER
Most halflings see sunflowers as good omens as they are able to find the sun, regardless of where it may rest in the sky. As a result, quilts bearing sunflowers are used to indicate a safe house. While these safe houses are not the Bellflower barns run by members of the Network, they are run by individuals sympathetic to the Bellflower’s cause. A traveler that recognizes the quilt can knock on the home’s door, ask for directions to the “Turning Theater”—a reference to the halfling goddess Chaldira. Those in the know can then respond “How would you perform?” Responding with the phrase “Why, with all my buttons!” in halfling completes the exchange. The keeper of the home typically invites the traveler in, though typically through a back door or side door to avoid suspicion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.294,t=0.484,r=0.480,b=0.948), with ID f3645339-2030-4209-b294-236991fc3719 -->

# BLUE DAISY
Daisies are used in several Bellflower quilts. Most daisies signal nothing and are in fact used as decoys and red herrings. A Bellflower member might own dozens of daisy quilts used to hide the presence of actual signal quilts. A clothesline with a white daisy quilt at each end indicates false signal quilts meant to throw trackers off the scent of travelers. A blue daisy is the only daisy with significance. It's used to notify allies of the Bellflower Network that a tiller will be arriving soon with travelers in tow. The number of flowers indicates the days of travel until the arrival and the state of bloom indicates how prepared the group is. A barely blooming daisy notes that the group will need lots of rations, medicine, tools, and other aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.485,r=0.681,b=0.943), with ID 26e63c32-5c6f-471f-a00c-257f50e718b1 -->

LOTUS
A quilt with a lotus signifies safe passage over water. This might suggest a ferry that transports anyone, no questions asked, or a Bellflower contact that has some means of transport available. The lotus petals also suggest preferred times for passage. A white lotus notes passage available primarily near dawn, while pink and violet lotuses indicate passages at dusk or during the night respectively. Finally, the flower's state of bloom can notify of danger. A fully bloomed lotus announces safe passage while even a single closed lotus on the quilt indicates that travelers should be cautious as there are eyes around that might report suspicious activity. Most of these quilts feature several lotuses to more easily hide a closed lotus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.700,t=0.485,r=0.886,b=0.946), with ID 0f580f07-2d88-42b4-86f1-095baee1d432 -->

I was leading an expedition north to the Stormspear Mountain when we were hit by a family of yetis in a snowstorm, and I was sure that a couple of us weren’t going to be making it home. Out of nowhere, arrows starting punching through the monsters, and a one-eyed bear came tearing out from the snow. I learned two things that day: there are archers good enough to shoot through a blizzard, and Nankou of Icemark is a good friend to have.

# LINNORM KING OF ICEMARK
## NG MALE HUMAN RANGER
Born in the taiga of Icemark, Nankou’s life started bitterly. His tribe was slaughtered by one of the fearsome draconic creatures known as a linnorm on the day of his birth. His pregnant and wounded mother, Ninnok (N female human hunter), fled as her fellow tribe members died, frantically running to secure a small piece of their future. Ninnok managed to survive giving birth in the desolate taiga, then carried her infant one desperate mile after another until she collapsed near Seer’s Home, a settlement serving as home to the elders of all Varki tribes. Ninnok was cared for by the elders, though the trauma and tragedy she had endured left her quiet and withdrawn. Nankou grew up raised on the collected stories, knowledge, and wisdom of all the Varki tribes while learning to hunt and fish to provide for his mother. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.108,r=0.914,b=0.294), with ID b1ceb5fc-d71c-4e6c-a92f-fc7c5aac5281 -->

While hunting shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Nankou encountered a newborn black bear, mewling and blind-eyed as it cuddled against its mother’s torn and half-eaten corpse. Nankou felt an instant affinity for the tiny creature whose birth seemed so akin to his own, and he adopted the bear cub, naming it T’kamo. Nankou and T’kamo grew strong and powerful together, for Nankou’s skillful archery and knowledge of medicine and woodcraft were well complemented by T’kamo’s implacable strength and patience. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.295,r=0.914,b=0.401), with ID ad4f7a97-58a8-4fa7-8922-ec123d4b57d7 -->

Over the decades of their adventures together, Nankou and T’kamo became folk heroes for the Varki of Icemark. Born to a dead tribe and raised by the elders of all tribes, Nankou was welcome among almost all of the Varki tribes, and the earnest young man was happy to repay each tribe’s hospitality. Hunting, slaying beasts and monsters, or relaying word of events affecting the region to Varki who lived far from trade routes, Nankou’s reputation grew to precede him wherever he went. Varki tribes quarreling with their Ulfen neighbors would seek out the young Varki for mediation; Nankou’s skill in Skald, the Ulfen tongue, and his naturally quiet demeanor made him an excellent diplomat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.389,t=0.402,r=0.913,b=0.538), with ID 9583ed9e-6494-449b-9b05-3785c085ff51 -->

As several unusually harsh winters in a row drove the nomadic Varki tribes closer to their Ulfen neighbors, Nankou began to see increasingly dangerous interactions between the Varki and Ulfen. The two peoples had coexisted for so long in part due to the rarity of their crossings, and as they found themselves in increasingly close contact, misunderstandings like lopsided trade agreements threatened to undermine the longstanding peace. It was then that Nankou truly understood exactly what it was he had been born for. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.540,r=0.913,b=0.648), with ID 829eace1-bf12-4e27-a7b6-43c78fe879da -->

Taking up his bow and with T’kamo at his side, Nankou returned to the frozen
woodlands of his birth, seeking the creature that had slain his tribe so long ago.
Nankou and T’kamo fought a fearsome battle from which neither warrior escaped
unscathed. Nankou gave an eye, and T’kamo one as well, along with his fore-claw,
but in the end they returned to Seer’s Home bearing the head of a mighty taiga
linnorm. Nankou declared himself the linnorm king of Icemark and decreed that
he must ratify all trade agreements. Since the Varki do not enter into formal trade
agreements with each other, this functionally made Nankou the primary diplomat
for his people with the Ulfen, whose awe at the Varki’s proven claim to the title of
linnorm king has smoothed relations between the peoples significantly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.650,r=0.914,b=0.801), with ID 247ce16a-397f-47fd-8dec-0241fd0c55d3 -->

# KING OF THE TAIGA
Nankou’s position as the only Varki linnorm king sets him apart from almost everyone in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Varki and Ulfen alike. The Varki love him but see him as much as an extension of the Varki people as an individual. The Ulfen respect his skill as a warrior, but otherwise aren’t quite sure what to make of him. Nankou enjoys the solitude of his unique position. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.813,r=0.913,b=0.907), with ID c4e16c35-33a4-4f83-a478-eb66c1c7474b -->

Despite his relatively recent claim to the title of linnorm king, Nankou has
surprisingly good relationships with some of his nearby monarchs. White Estrid <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.909,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID 6ad6e361-1e5b-417f-9a70-42545bea4b53 -->

has sent multiple diplomats to Icemark since Nankou claimed the throne, though the emissaries have often found themselves indulging in Icemark’s hospitality for months while waiting for Nankou to return from the tundra. White Estrid’s detractors have on more than one occasion tried to use this eagerness to disparage her, but in the face of Estrid’s far greater heresy of keeping a linnorm as a pet, these attempts have usually fallen flat on their face. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.063,r=0.619,b=0.157), with ID 75be19a1-f94f-4236-b847-a315344a36a9 -->

Nankou also considers himself friendly with Thira Ash-Eyes, the successor to and daughter of longstanding Linnorm King **Sveinn Blood-Eagle** (CN male human barbarian). When Sveinn sailed off to Valenhall, most of his fractious children quarreled in the streets of Kalsgard, while young Thira instead hewed to the traditions of her people and set out to slay a linnorm. A practitioner of arcane magic, Thira was often overlooked and underestimated by other Ulfen, despite her skill with a blade. As she trekked out into the wilderness between Icemark and the Thanelands, she encountered Nankou in his wanderings. Already a linnorm king by this point, Nankou recognized the young warrior’s aspirations and shared a fire and a meal with her. Thira claimed her own linnorm and the throne that went with it, and still remembers the Varki ranger fondly. Nankou hopes this meeting will help to strengthen the relations between the Ulfen of the Thanelands and the Varki of Icemark. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.158,r=0.616,b=0.341), with ID ed59f795-4944-49ec-a666-62ce41aca4c9 -->

Not all of Nankou’s neighbors are so pleasant. King **Ingimundr the Unruly** (CE male human barbarian) of nearby Broken Bay is notably old-fashioned and even more notably quarrelsome. Ingimundr’s open encouragement of raiding remains one of Nankou’s pressing threats. Though the Ulfen king claims distance from those ships who plunder other Linnorm Kingdoms, it is well-known that he also turns a blind eye to them, and Nankou’s proximity no doubt marks him as an attractive target. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.341,r=0.616,b=0.435), with ID 1cd11a5f-3740-4277-9d15-93ae46a8db7a -->

# THE HUNTER
Nankou loves nothing so much as hunting deadly monsters. While he bears great respect for the wildlife of Icemark, he ruthlessly exterminates unnatural creatures that undermine the delicate ecosystems of his territory. Nankou has a particular hatred for taiga linnorms, and occasionally seeks out others to help him hunt the deadly beasts down. After losing an eye and taking on a deadly curse during the fight that made him a linnorm king, Nankou is not so prideful as to insist that he meet other linnorms in single combat. When Nankou can’t find a group of adventurers willing to assist him in a linnorm hunt,  
he takes special precautions, laying elaborate traps and finding just the right environs to prepare for the battle before settling in to wait for as long as is required. Nankou and his black bear companion T’kamo possess deep wells of patience and are said to have killed more linnorms than the one he keeps at Seer’s Home to ratify his claim to the title of linnorm king. Those who would hunt a linnorm would do well to accept Nankou’s assistance if it is offered.

picture: The lower right of the image contains a close-up of a bear's face, with one eye missing and a visible scar. The bear's mouth is slightly open, showing its teeth. The image is cropped so that only the head and part of the neck are visible. The bear appears to be Nankou, as described in the text. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.445,r=0.614,b=0.754), with ID 6b95a0ae-e801-4319-ab30-d117d38a3b9a -->

Nankou constantly wanders the taiga and tundras of Icemark, occasionally slipping over the borders into his neighbors’ domains. Any group that dares to travel the uncharted lands would find that the one-eyed Varki with the one-eyed bear might very well be the friendliest encounter they can expect in those environs, so long as they treat the ranger, his bear, and the Varki people with respect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.755,r=0.493,b=0.865), with ID 3fe936a0-47e6-4f81-802b-fdde89b94017 -->

# WORDS OF THE KING
Linnorm king is a silly title. I have never once had a single linnorm bow in obeisance to me or even pay my words any heed. But there is power in words, and in the meaning people invest them with. Scarcely a handful of years past my people were on the brink of war with the Ulfen, with scarce food and grim winters driving us inexorably towards a conflict that held only despair for both sides. Then I slew a great beast and called myself its king, and peace became a possibility where before we had no hope. So I shall be a linnorm king and allow those words to define me in the eyes of strangers, for doing so has given me Ulfen brothers and sisters where once only enemies stood before me.

VANISHED WIZARD KING
N MALE HUMAN WIZARD
The wizard Nex emerged during the decline of pharaonic Osirion, near the end of the Age of Destiny. Though clearly a legend who shaped the arcane and political landscape of Garund for nearly five millennia, Nex is a controversial figure in the modern day. At once a peerless scholar and a fierce war master, the archwizard’s artifice stands in stark contrast to his centuries-long rivalry with the necromancer Geb. The clash between the two would lead to the loss of countless lives, the ravaging of both lands, the disappearance of Nex himself, and Geb’s transformation to ghostly tyrant. Long absent from the kingdom bearing his name, Nex lives on in much the same way as Geb—an uneasy rumor haunting a tenuously peaceful realm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.107,r=0.915,b=0.282), with ID 3d6de5fc-589b-426e-9fc5-8779a1982cea -->

# CHASING DESTINY
Nex began his journey as an adventurer, a wizard with a peculiar fascination with conjuration and divination. Guided by insights snatched from the Great Beyond, the ambitious wizard sought to craft a mighty destiny for himself. To that end, Nex searched for power and wisdom in the ruins of civilizations long past. In his research, he sought out cryptic bas-reliefs in the Mwangi Expanse, ley lines beneath Quantium, and scrying pools in the cyclopean depths of cursed Gholanoth. His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex—a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power—and in rumored immortality. None alive can say if agelessness alone was enough for Nex to achieve his destiny, but his legacy has led countless adventurers into the Crux to build their own legend. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.293,r=0.914,b=0.462), with ID 5663e990-fb35-49bc-a707-9ba833bc7fe9 -->

Soon thereafter, Nex laid his eyes upon the gem beyond compare: the city of Absalom. Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom’s skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city’s gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein.

Serving as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex’s horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society’s Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard’s ambition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.466,r=0.915,b=0.708), with ID 660a3916-1629-441f-9315-b08e44cff4f4 -->

RIVALRY  
Though among the most powerful wizards of his age, Nex was not without rival in power and determination. The archwizard could be brash, and his pursuit of arcane secrets often put him at odds with beings strange and mighty. The Zenj epic Song of the Fallen Briar recounts an early adventure in which the ambitious wizard sought sky-fallen relics among the toppled temples and shattered towers of the Mwangi Expanse. According to the Song, the young wizard earned the first of his great enemies in the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, after Nex and his companions thwarted one of the powerful fey demigod’s plans. The Eldest and the wizard-king would clash many times after that first encounter, most notably when Nex “borrowed” a bandersnatch to relieve a pirate siege on Quantium. Curiously, after Nex sought to invade Absalom with a horde drawn from other planes—most prominently the shadowy fey horrors Count Ranalc was known to master—the Exiled Eldest vanished from the historical record. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.721,r=0.914,b=0.938), with ID 560c89f0-857a-406f-a855-82b33089ce79 -->

No account of the wizard-king is complete without mention of his greatest rival,
the necromancer Geb. The two archwizards blurred national lines with alarming
frequency, each seeking to expand their reach at the expense of the other. Raids
and skirmishes would evolve over decades and centuries into a deadly war, as Nex
and Geb inflicted increasingly bizarre sorceries upon one another. From plagues
that ossified hapless farmers to crawling behemoths the rival of any dragon,
the devastating powers unleashed created a blighted no-man’s land between the
two nations, called the Mana Wastes. As thousands perished, the wizard-kings
artificially extended their lives through obscure and perilous sorceries, creating
a cold war that would span generations, ending suddenly when a Gebbite attack
wreathed the city of Quantium in poisonous fumes. Though the attack cost
countless lives, Nex was able to retreat to his personal demiplane, the Refuge of
Nex, while the city rallied a defense, only for the wizard to vanish entirely from
Golarion. Geb, haunted by an enemy truly beyond his reach for decades, finally
ended his life a full 60 years later. Nex has yet to emerge from the Refuge, but his
legend still looms over Garund. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.078,r=0.617,b=0.327), with ID 03d40f54-14ac-45be-a7e4-ff98a5bd9102 -->

# PERILOUS STIRRINGS
Millennia after his disappearance, cryptic signs point to the stirring of an ancient power. New horrors haunt the Mana Wastes: gargantuan beasts and swarms of spell-stitched abominations that stalk the already-perilous region, devouring those that wander too far from well-defended roads. High King Anong Arunak has placed a bounty on these creatures, promising a great reward to those cunning enough to track the monsters to their source and end the threat to Dongun Hold. Meanwhile, in grim Ecanus, the fleshforges have been restive of late, cycling through their birthing sequence at random and spawning abominations that vanish into the night. Chief Fleshforger **Dunn Palovar** (N male human fleshforger) is quietly seeking aid in putting down these rogue beasts as he works to discover why the forges have begun spawning of their own volition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.337,r=0.616,b=0.524), with ID bb4d0853-a26f-4a46-807a-f75c044099c6 -->

Mere miles from Absalom’s gates, the Cairnlands groan and tremble as the Spire of Nex thrums to an alien frequency. The northern passage has grown unsafe, and city scouts report strange flickerings in the sky on approach of the Spire. Wandering caravans have been waylaid and even veterans of the city vanguard have become lost, as familiar bends in the road unexpectedly point to the titanic monument. Acting Primarch Wynsal Starborn, ever wary of an attack, has challenged Pathfinder Society Venture-Captain Shevala Iorae to help Absalom’s First Guard solve the mysteries of the Spire, that Starborn might lead an investigation into that baleful relic. As word of the challenge spreads, Absalom braces for the return of an ancient enemy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.525,r=0.615,b=0.662), with ID ea55752b-a2bf-4209-81d2-cbc3eaa6e5a3 -->

Befitting a titan that profoundly impacted the history of Garund, Nex left behind a rich, if conflicted, legacy. Quantium’s marvelous Bandeshar, with its floating towers and innumerable libraries, evokes the visionary who inspired generations of arcane advancement. The bleak Mana Wastes and the monstrous fleshforges of Ecanus recall the ruthless war master who spent innumerable lives in his quest for power. The grim and fantastical Spire of Nex that has loomed over Absalom for millennia is a monument to a man who challenged the gods themselves. In this fallen age, as the deepest reaches of the Bandeshar stir for the first time in ages, the many faces of Nex weigh heavily upon his people. Can this time of peace survive a living legend? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.664,r=0.616,b=0.832), with ID 15107dc9-cf5c-4823-aab7-4021e847b1b6 -->

# RULER OF RAZMIRAN
LE MALE HUMAN WIZARD
Leader of the nation he forged, Razmir is a ruler bold enough to call himself a living god. Claiming to have taken the test of the Starstone back in 4660 AR, this so-called deity set about carving out a swath of the River Kingdoms to call his own, destroying anyone who dared to stand in his way. In the years since, Razmir has attracted an influential cult of followers. Lured to him with the promise of prosperity and peace, converts more often than not find themselves struggling to survive in a nation that seems built to funnel wealth and privilege to the priests. They are told that only through more devotion to Razmir might they be able find a way into a paradise in this life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.106,r=0.916,b=0.279), with ID 4fcd2ba3-8589-41b7-9b64-84d99c41beb4 -->

Razmir shrouds his past in rumor and myth, especially when
it comes to his life before his supposed attempt at the test of the
Starstone. In fact, scholars who have attempted to collect a complete
tale of the Living God’s mortal days find the history filled with
conflicting events and differing origins. Some stories, for
example, claim that he grew up in Taldor, penniless on the
streets of Oppara, begging for food and sleeping under a
sewer grate; others purport that he was raised in Varisia on a
small rural farm, destined to live a simple life until he uncovered
the secret library of the Runelords, learning to wield their mighty
power all on his own. Despite their differences, all of these stories
bear a few basic similarities. In each, Razmir came from humble
beginnings, neither wealthy nor powerful, but through his own
cunning and daring, he rose to become a deity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.470,t=0.280,r=0.916,b=0.493), with ID 78890124-c58b-4627-a23c-e039d74e08b5 -->

What is known conclusively is that he arrived in the River
Kingdoms in 4661 AR and declared himself to the people of Xer, a
town on the border with Kyonin. As Razmir gathered followers, the
local magistrate attempted to arrest him inside the halls of his very
first temple. Razmir offered the magistrate a place in the clergy if
he would submit, but the magistrate refused. In a flash of power, the
poor magistrate was transformed into a fox, left to wander the world,
forced to finally believe his own senses. The town was under Razmir’s
control in less than a week, but this angered the nearby Duke Melcat of
Aerduin, who considered Xer to be part of his domain. Razmir offered
prosperity and peace to Duke Melcat if only he would convert to the
faith. Three times Duke Melcat refused, and on the final refusal, Razmir
summoned a cloud of smoke and flame that erased Aerduin from the
face of Avistan. In this moment, Razmiran was born. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.460,t=0.495,r=0.915,b=0.708), with ID 82973eb8-2f10-426a-94a9-c6cae4325faf -->

From there, the Living God spread his faith north, annexing over a dozen small fiefdoms and minor kingdoms. His army was made up entirely from converts—they were far from professional warriors, but with the personal backing of Razmir, they were rarely challenged. It was only upon reaching Ustalav that this expansion slowed. Razmir’s attempts to annex further River Kingdoms have proven fruitless. That has not stopped him from trying, although he now employs subtler methods. The faithful of Razmir travel far and wide to spread the gospel. When arriving in a community, they immediately take up with the poor and indigent, offering them food, aid, and succor, all the while telling these desperate souls about the glory that is Razmir. With the new believers behind them, they then petition to open up a shrine and pressure local businesses to offer up donations to the church to protect and improve the neighborhood. If left unchecked, they soon infiltrate the local militia and then the government, using masks to hide the true identities of the faithful. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.709,r=0.917,b=0.940), with ID 44b5364e-5f33-4fd4-a8c4-5fa8b0fc328e -->

# FRIENDS AND FOES OF THE FAITH
As the head of his own religion, Razmir has few friends. His foes weigh far more heavily on the Living God’s mind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.383,r=0.617,b=0.433), with ID 4164aeba-67d5-48df-a8ae-a2bd6a70c853 -->

Artokus Kirran, the Thuvian alchemist, has long been brewing a precious sun orchid elixir that can return any imbiber to youth. After Razmir’s winning bid on the elixir was fraudulently rejected—at least, in his own mind—rumors hold that Razmir has sent a number of agents of Thuvia to either steal the recipe for the elixir or perhaps even kidnap the alchemist. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.433,r=0.615,b=0.509), with ID e8822b14-ec73-4ebb-b3fd-97f5a625d01d -->

Razmir technically remains at war with the elven nation of Kyonin, though
the ruler seems to have little interest in actually pursuing any battles with his
neighbors. Yet Queen Telandia Edasseril’s policy of allowing fleeing citizens
of Razmiran into Kyonin, so long as they aren’t Razmir’s priests, has recently
resulted in turmoil along the two nations’ shared borders. In addition to refugees
being attacked by cultists intent upon showing defectors the error of their ways,
Queen Telandia suspects that Razmir may have sent infiltrators to weaken Kyonin
for some unknown purpose—or simply out of spite. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.510,r=0.614,b=0.632), with ID 8d7caa8d-a064-4741-8e96-8eabe2c90544 -->

No one is a bigger threat to Razmir’s rule than the Whispering Tyrant. Freed from his prison under Gallowspire, Tar-Baphon is now rebuilding his fortress on the Isle of Terror, making his return an existential threat to all those who border Lake Encarthan. Not long after the Tyrant’s return, Razmir sent a herald to the Isle with an offer of nonaggression. The herald returned, now a wraith wearing the mask of Razmir’s faith, accepting the offer with one condition: Razmiran would tithe its dead to the Tyrant, at least 1,000 bodies per month, to maintain the peace. No one knows if the Living God accepted these terms, but as of yet there has been no fighting between the two. The Pale Mask, as the herald has come to be known, still resides in Thronestep and can be found wandering the city at night. Yet Blood Mistress Jakalyn of the Red Mantis Assassins recently announced that someone had paid for a contract to be placed on Tar-Baphon, and discovered that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. It’s uncertain whether the missive was from Razmir himself, an acolyte who overstepped, or an enemy hoping to gain Razmir the wrong sort of attention, and just as uncertain is what might result from a clash between any of these three powers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.633,r=0.615,b=0.862), with ID e1baea7e-b313-4ff5-bb60-812f5b1e4852 -->

Tieflings can face prejudice from many sources due to their association with fiends, but ironically, one of the places they are most despised is the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. Though citizens pay homage to the devil Asmodeus, society believes any relations with lesser devils should be one with the mortal firmly in command–tieflings are seen as a sign of a lapse in judgment and a corruption of a mortal bloodline. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.069,r=0.363,b=0.267), with ID a7c7fa28-aa45-47e6-9ea8-6867cc020aba -->

INFAMOUS REBEL VIGILANTE  
CG FEMALE TIEFLING 4TH HUMAN BARD  
The Night of Ashes changed everything for Vyvienne Ashurka. Before the sudden and brutal crackdown on dissidents against House Thrune, Vyvienne had been intensely focused on her career as an actor and singer in Kintargo’s robust theater scene, hoping to achieve something like the fame of her favorite opera star, Shensen (CG female half-elf celebrity)—and hoping to keep her tiefling heritage forever concealed. She had been fortunate in both respects, steadily landing roles and easily using her magical powers to disguise the orange-tinged fur and yellow eyes that she owed to a rakshasa progenitor. She had left the slums of northern Westcrown behind for this opportunity, making the arduous journey to Kintargo with only her sister—they had left home after the death of their parents, who were slaughtered along with the other members of the Bastards of Erebus tiefling gang. Vyvienne was thus no stranger to violence and loss. But as dawn rose following that particularly blood-soaked night in Kintargo, as the flames still sputtered and the cries rose over Shensen’s disappearance, Vyvienne felt the smoldering hate that she harbored for House Thrune burst into insatiable flames. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.382,t=0.107,r=0.915,b=0.370), with ID 7e3d2df3-d56e-4b86-92cb-d31fb069ceda -->

she harbored for House Thrune burst into insatiable flames.
	It didn’t take her long to find and join Shensen’s revolutionary friends, the Silver Ravens. In searching for her idol, who was later rescued by heroes, Vyvienne quickly learned the worth of infiltration and espionage. Already adept at disguise, Vyvienne further learned its value as she crafted an alter ego, a new hero named the Sapphire Butterfly.
	In the guise of the Butterfly, she could act swiftly and directly against Thrune agents and raise the morale of the oppressed; as Vyvienne, she could sneak into a party hosted by local nobility and learn Thrune’s secrets. She could also show her true heritage as the Butterfly, serving as a symbol to all the people of Cheliax of the power, intelligence, and beauty of tieflings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.358,r=0.915,b=0.526), with ID 5311147f-2ad3-4e3d-906b-d19a3c36f860 -->

With Vyvienne’s tireless aid, the Silver Ravens succeeded in liberating Kintargo and creating the new state of Ravounel. Perhaps the Sapphire Butterfly’s work could have ended there, and Vyvienne could have returned to the stage. But the stages of Kintargo now seemed too small to her. Yes, Ravounel was free, but Westcrown was not. Thrune still controlled most of Cheliax; beyond its borders, oppressed peoples struggled for freedom that was just barely out of reach. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.526,r=0.914,b=0.617), with ID 8d5c606d-01ae-44b2-b05a-1ee10b4269fb -->

When the Vidric rebels sailed into Kintargo’s harbor, the Sapphire Butterfly was among the first to embrace them. She actively encouraged the alliance between these freedom fighters and the Silver Ravens that would lead to the birth of the Firebrands. When a rebellion sparked in Galt that claimed to be tied to the Firebrands, the Sapphire Butterfly immediately advocated assistance and was soon on the front lines. She now travels throughout the Inner Sea Region, showing up to aid the oppressed as they rise up, to foment rebellion forward, to end slavery, and to help local Firebrands in all such causes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.391,t=0.618,r=0.914,b=0.739), with ID 8a715e88-48d1-4713-b3cc-467b9fb6d5fc -->

Vyvienne remains close to her sister, **Emylne** (NG female tiefling^APG human seamstress), who brims with courageous loyalty and offers her support whenever possible. But Emylne is happy to make costumes for Kintargo’s operas and to contemplate bringing children into an improving world. Vyvienne has no such dreams for herself, no desire to settle down or to complicate the freedom that allows her to be where she is needed, whenever she is needed. In truth, she has never allowed herself to fall in love. She has never been willing to be that vulnerable—not even when romantic entanglements were in vogue among her acting friends, in those long-ago days before the Night of Ashes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.741,r=0.913,b=0.878), with ID cd12bd54-5f82-46a5-a819-1e1aa93831e2 -->

DRAMATIS PERSONAE
When Vyvienne joined the Silver Ravens and their rebellion, she became familiar with the Bellflower Network, thanks to operative Laria Longroad (CG female <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.387,t=0.890,r=0.914,b=0.940), with ID c22a4b74-2c28-4a90-9914-16893e3f6a7c -->

halfling information broker), who provided the Ravens with a safe house. The
Sapphire Butterfly continues to work with the Bellflower Network, particularly
with Kintargo’s **Nolly Peltry** (CG female halfling abolitionist) and Farmers
Magdelena and Martum Fallows, in their efforts to liberate halflings and eliminate
slavery in Cheliax and beyond. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.078,r=0.618,b=0.157), with ID f0d1f478-ec3c-4598-8258-8edf43508b21 -->

During her time as a Silver Raven, Vyvienne came to know **Lady Mialari Docur**
(CN female elf spy), founder and headmistress of Lady Docur’s School for Girls,
and learned her secret: Lady Docur is also the founder and head of the Lacunafex,
a spy network that operates throughout Cheliax. While the forlorn elf and the
tiefling have little in common, they share knowledge and strategy in the fight
against House Thrune. Docur has proved a pivotal ally in Vyvienne’s endeavors,
helping her keep up to date with the machinations of House Thrune to stay one
step ahead of dottari and Hellknights while in Cheliax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.157,r=0.617,b=0.280), with ID 54aa70c8-4b4e-4cd0-bc9f-6f6c35987a93 -->

While she has constant clashes with Hellknights, Vyvienne has established a cautious yet promising relationship with Lictor Toulon Vidoc of the Order of the Scourge, though he is not quite aware of it yet. Using her connections with both the Bellflower Network and the Lacunafex, Vyvienne places strategic bread crumbs for Vidoc and his Hellknights to find, providing them with additional evidence in their investigation of Queen Abrogail II. Vidoc finds the ease of acquiring evidence to be unusually convenient and has since begun an investigation of the Order itself to determine the origin of this evidence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.281,r=0.616,b=0.402), with ID 286981f1-23f5-4285-b763-ac8cd0e808f1 -->

From almost the moment that she sailed into Kintargo’s harbor, Shimali Manux and Vyvienne have been close allies. Recognizing the similarities between the rebellions in Vidrian and Ravounel, Vyvienne embraced Shimali’s cause, and the two women were instrumental in the birth of the international band of showboating rebels known as the Firebrands. Although they are seldom in the same place at the same time, they manage to work closely together. The Sapphire Butterfly has even been known to call on Manux’s fleet for transportation to lands in need of Firebrand assistance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.401,r=0.532,b=0.541), with ID b8e8bba0-b69c-43db-8d77-6949db6cb191 -->

The Sapphire Butterfly’s relationship with Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind, leader of the Free Captains of the Shackles, is much more complicated, in part because of the role of the Free Captains who served as mercenaries for Sargava (now Vidrian). A philosophical gulf exists between the Firebrands, who tend to be idealistic and see themselves as serving the greater good, and the Free Captains, who prize freedom as it suits and serves themselves. This fundamentally mercenary creed is not necessarily shared by Tessa, but it colors the extent to which Vyvienne is willing to trust or ally with the Free Captains. For her part, Tessa grudgingly admires the work of some notable Firebrands and is willing to ally with them when they ask for aid, though such alliances are never public. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.541,r=0.570,b=0.724), with ID fc694f8c-c0e6-4322-952b-0d48f696c172 -->

The Sapphire Butterfly’s ultimate dream is a free Cheliax. Fueling that dream, deep in her soul, is a hatred of House Thrune. If she had the opportunity—even half of an opportunity—she would not hesitate to kill Queen Abrogail II. The feeling is mutual, with Queen Abrogail openly declaring the Sapphire Butterfly an enemy of Cheliax. The bounty on the Sapphire Butterfly’s head has only made her efforts within Cheliax much more difficult, and exciting, as a result. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.725,r=0.514,b=0.848), with ID 124be2cd-603c-4683-82aa-edb4208a5040 -->

# MISSION OF MERCY
Shimali has recently received a plea directly from Farmers Magdelena and Martum Fallows. Nestled just inside the Ravounel border, the village of Sember Cove has been struck with scarlet leprosy. A Chelaxian frigate volunteered to coordinate aid efforts, but in truth the captain is attempting to starve the town as punishment for harboring Bellflower Network sympathizers. Shimali now plots to run the blockade and deliver clerical aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.069,r=0.362,b=0.266), with ID 59991726-1bbf-4b98-bb96-7661dfb51934 -->

ADMIRAL OF VIDRIAN’S NAVY  
NG FEMALE HALF-ELF SWASHBUCKLER  
*With my errand complete, I took stock of my situation. I was in Eleder on the eve of revolution. I had not a dagger to my name. Night was falling, and the local marines were combing the docks for drunkards to press into service. I decided to quit the city posthaste, under any captain who would have me.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.108,r=0.915,b=0.203), with ID 0f50a98d-65f7-4bf8-8908-ce460f3176e1 -->

_Said captain was Shimali Manux. My first assignment was to steal her a ship.  
That should give you a flavor of those wild days. Unlike today's Firebrands, Shimali was no showboater. She was daring because she had literally nothing to lose. The moonlit cutting-out expeditions? The mad duels in the ratlines? These were born of desperation and simple math: to free her country, she needed frigates.  
Turns out if you steal enough leaky tubs, they make you a legend._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.203,r=0.914,b=0.297), with ID 28920e4f-de01-4c53-a07b-66e5067d3bbf -->

—Excerpt from the letters of Seimon Candelar, Gray Corsair

Shimali Manux’s Sargavan father was a spice trader, her elven Ekujae mother his guide and translator. They had two children, Shimali and **Vulmia** (NG female half-elf navigator). The girls, fraternal twins, spent their long childhoods in both parents’ spheres, learning tables and tide charts one season and jungle lore the next. But the ocean pulled at Shimali, and when they were old enough, the sisters went to sea. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.300,r=0.912,b=0.402), with ID a433e875-d118-407c-8965-d5ff2f622c4e -->

Tragedy struck while they were away. Their father was blamed for missing funds and hanged, while Aspis Consortium loggers demolished their mother’s village and the government stood by. Even as the sisters learned of these horrors, the sloop they served on was burned to the waterline for failing to pay a Free Captain a bribe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.403,r=0.914,b=0.478), with ID db6226aa-dfd8-4839-9a26-1f7c11192c1b -->

Prejudice and greed had left the girls orphaned and adrift. So Shimali and Vulumia went to war. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.479,r=0.913,b=0.509), with ID c02947c0-7508-449c-a078-509a8064d3f0 -->

The sisters fell in with a young Avarneus, who was equally desperate to shake
off the Sargavan colonial yoke. While Avarneus remained on land, scheming from
inside the government, the sisters assembled a ragtag crew of rebels, misfits, and
hard-up adventurers. With Shimali taking the lead and Vulmia watching her back,
they boarded ship after ship and commandeered them, striking at multiple ports
simultaneously to keep harbormasters guessing. If luck turned against them, they
hid in the jungle, recuperating with the Ekujae only to strike again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.511,r=0.913,b=0.616), with ID d749a5ac-c22d-4658-a5c5-b5b461ade60a -->

Soon, the rebellion in Vidrian brought down the barony and drove the Sargavan
rulers from their shores. Only at that point did the struggle at sea begin in earnest.
Outraged at the loss of Sargava’s tribute, the Free Captains tried to sack the
new nation in recompense. Shimali had been preparing for this, and she met
them with her makeshift fleet, trading blow for blow until the decks were
stained with blood. But Shimali’s tenacity won out, and the ragtag alliance
of Senghor’s navy and Shimali’s stolen ships drove the Free Captains from
Desolation Bay. With that triumph, Vidrian was born. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.618,r=0.913,b=0.739), with ID 7befcc86-3fcd-4c9e-8513-718d437c46ec -->

Desolation Bay. With that triumph, Vidrian was born.
     Since then, Shimali has been gathering allies for her fledgling country. She has made stops in every port she can, seeking introductions and promises of aid. To her relief, Absalom, Andoran, and Osirion responded positively. But her visit to Ravounel bore the most fruit. There she found a warm welcome among her fellow revolutionaries, the Silver Ravens. What began as an official pledge of mutual aid blossomed behind closed doors into a new network of freedom fighters, dedicated to fighting oppression and slavery wherever it may be found.
     True to their name, these Firebrands have sparked good deeds and feats of bravery across the continent, their progress aided by Shimali’s swift fleet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.428,t=0.726,r=0.913,b=0.938), with ID 85d2165d-8c10-4fe9-b927-f36636c69baa -->

Today, Shimali commands Vidrian’s navy. She is bemused that her reputation makes her seem a dashing figure, but she recognizes the value her legend serves Firebrand recruiters. Fortunately, legend and reality are not far apart: Shimali is a kind-hearted woman who goes out of her way to help others, and with an armada and the Firebrands at her back, she does more good than most. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.077,r=0.619,b=0.160), with ID 3fda3ad2-5b9e-4b6f-80e9-ae4ea5f7fcbf -->

# A GROWING LEGACY
Shimali Manux’s closest ally is her sister, Vulpia. Content to avoid politics, Vulpia serves on the Firebrand ship *Nightwave*, ensuring her twin’s former rival—and current paramour—Captain **Devrin Arlos** (CG male human free captain) returns from his madcap adventures. No one knows Shimali’s mind like Vulpia, which has led to trouble in recent times. Spymasters up and down the coast would pay dearly to question either sister about the other, and to date there have been two kidnapping attempts on Vulpia by enemies of Vidrian. The Firebrands dealt with these plots handily, and both Vulpia and Shimali have publicly laughed them off for the time being. Recently, the siblings have been working to stop Chelaxian ships from polluting nearby merfolk realms. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.169,r=0.619,b=0.341), with ID f85e8bb7-6de5-4a3f-82e7-3d9d881da541 -->

Shimali’s other comrade-in-arms, Avarneus, is a member of Vidrian’s ruling council. While they remain close, Avarneus sometimes frets that Shimali is still too idealistic, and that her good nature and thrill for adventure will prove her downfall. The two maintain frequent communication over Vidrian’s affairs. New nations crave legitimacy, and Shimali works hard to lay the groundwork for future Vidric embassies, as well as seeking allies and fixers in foreign courts—particularly in older realms like Taldor and Qadira that are suspicious of revolutionaries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.342,r=0.619,b=0.449), with ID 38347b9d-5957-4e97-b88f-5df42294717f -->

When Shimali came petitioning Absalom for aid, she left with both diplomatic acknowledgment and a strong admiration for Wynsal Starborn. The two share a love of justice and the discomfort of being thrust into statecraft under extreme circumstances. Shimali is grateful for Starborn’s advocacy when Vidrian was most vulnerable and keeps an eye out for opportunities to repay him in kind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.449,r=0.620,b=0.526), with ID bd187967-754f-4645-9712-88e02ca9a268 -->

Nearly every Firebrand looks up to Shimali as the group’s co-founder and dashing figurehead, and she counts the Silver Ravens’ **Shensen** (CG female half-elf celebrity) as a dear friend. Shimali’s fleet keeps the Sapphire Butterfly flitting from crisis point to crisis point—most recently smuggling escaped slaves for the Bellflower Network. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.526,r=0.620,b=0.588), with ID 63539298-f1ab-4985-b4d3-63a0a2522f89 -->

If Shimali fears anyone, it is Queen Abrogail Thrune II. To Thrune, Sargava was an upstart colony needing to be brought to heel, and Vidrian is merely a fiction. Cheliax’s own revolutions have kept the monarch diverted, but it’s only a matter of time before she aims her dread navy southward. Shimali is constantly looking for new maritime allies as a bulwark against this inevitability. Meanwhile, her support of the Firebrands, Ravounel, and the Bellflower Network helps keep House Thrune off balance—for now. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.586,r=0.610,b=0.710), with ID 01b6c4e1-5290-4495-a570-004b41c2399b -->

Yet not all of Shimali’s enemies are so obvious. Two of
her captains have recently been assassinated in Anthusis,
Vidrian’s capital. Worse yet, a broken thistle arrow
shaft suggests the killer is Ekujae. Shimali refuses
to believe the elves would strike out at her
allies in such a way, leaving her to find
investigators to unravel the mystery—and
render the impartial verdict that she cannot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.709,r=0.465,b=0.834), with ID d84d5140-8fdc-408b-9c08-d50727a3599a -->

# HONOR AMONG THIEVES
Tessa Fairwind and Shimali have run afoul of each other numerous times—ever since Shimali nicked the Hurricane Queen’s future flagship, the _Umbral Spark_, out from under one of Fairwind’s lieutenants. They have had several engagements since, and each time the tides, misfortune, or magical chicanery have prevented a reckoning. Rumor has it that their antipathy has softened into grudging respect, especially as many Free Captains have found fortune and fame aiding Firebrand exploits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.638,t=0.071,r=0.878,b=0.299), with ID f3cee3fd-f3ad-4bb7-bb6e-df185a8205a8 -->

# OLD FRIENDS
During her time outside Mzali, Sihar spent several years at the Magaambya Academy. There she studied under the storyteller Janatimo, while also making allies of her fellow students. She was happy to know there were Emerald Boughs already in Mzali monitoring things–these were later indispensable in getting the Bright Lions off the ground. Thanks to the connections she made with the Rain-Scribes, she was able to set up a communication network to find allies and resources outside the city. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.071,r=0.362,b=0.283), with ID 27b058bc-5145-4322-b9f3-b2d0158bd988 -->

# LEADER OF THE BRIGHT LIONS
LG FEMALE HUMAN FIGHTER
Living in the city-state of Mzali is perfectly safe, as long as you follow every law, wish, and whim of the child god Walkena, who has ruled the city-state for over 100 years. If he finds you lacking, in either faith or loyalty, Walkena or one of his priests will waste no time in publicly and painfully executing you. For Walkena is a descendant of the deities of the Mzali—and close enough to a god in power that even those who don’t believe in his rightful rule can do little to oppose him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.383,t=0.107,r=0.916,b=0.234), with ID 876c7087-f118-4a91-abf4-4b5fb1e0ea04 -->

Yet some in Mzali have said, “No more! This is not who the city is, this is not what the Old Sun Gods preached.” They call themselves the Bright Lions, and they spend their time and resources organizing to fight against the tyranny that has overtaken their people. They speak of a time that Mzali was the center of a great empire, respected for its wealth and influence rather than for ruling with fear and cruelty. They say that one day things will be like that again, that one day they will overthrow Walkena, and that this day is coming. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.235,r=0.914,b=0.341), with ID e4b00cf8-c300-4501-8958-b14d77c39bc0 -->

Leading the Bright Lions is Sihar, a tall and muscular woman in her mid-thirties,
with the appearance of a warrior but the bearing of a scholar. Her face and body bear
the scars of her years as a mercenary, her fingers calloused by both a sword and a
brush pen. She wears her hair tight and high on her head, only letting it down when by
herself or with her closest friends and companions. Unlike the reds and golds of many
of the Bright Lions, Sihar usually dresses in blues and reds, with bright gold accents
woven through her garments. Her style is practical, always ready to enter battle at a
moment’s notice, but prepared to talk politics or preach the word of the old gods if it
might win a sympathetic ear—she is said to always carry a dagger and a book. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.341,r=0.914,b=0.479), with ID df8e404a-f47a-4782-85c9-7d8779f6224a -->

# GROWING UP UNDER THE CHILD GOD
Sihar grew up without a family. She doesn’t know if they were executed by Walkena like so many others, or if they simply abandoned her as a child. She remembers growing up in a temple dedicated to Walkena, remembers priests teaching her how he was a holy descendant of the gods, and how his word was the law. They taught her to read and write by transcribing Walkena’s holy word so that it could be spread across the whole Mwangi Expanse. Sihar remembers sneaking deeper into the temple with other orphans, finding statues, scripture, and paintings of the Old Sun Gods. As she learned more about them, she realized that their teachings were not the same as Walkena’s—that his views on justice and punishment were warped, blasphemous corruptions of the Old Sun Gods’ teachings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.384,t=0.491,r=0.913,b=0.661), with ID bc9ad070-fb99-41e1-a4ae-6f24ca618bc8 -->

Sihar remembers when as a teen, her best friend, fellow orphan and childhood crush—a sweet happy girl that everyone knew as Mouse—sold Sihar out to the priests after Mouse herself was caught sneaking out late at night. She remembers running away before the priests could get to her, living on the streets, stealing and scavenging what she could to eat. She remembers Mouse being executed by Walkena. She remembers the awful tears she wept for her companion and betrayer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.662,r=0.913,b=0.754), with ID c7a9d790-1a4d-463f-bda6-632b04d8e2ee -->

Sihar remembers when she chose her name, in honor of the Old Sun Gods, when she started using feminine pronouns and started to fully live as a woman. She remembers leaving the city, working as a mercenary and adventurer for close to two decades. When she had amassed enough money and allies, she made her way back to Mzali and established the Bright Lions, to spread the word of the Old Sun Gods and to one day overthrow Walkena. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.386,t=0.755,r=0.913,b=0.846), with ID ab825664-0599-4d69-9c23-57faf27768d1 -->

# BRIGHT LIONS
The Bright Lions’ members are numerous, but some integral players hold great importance both in the organization and to Sihar personally as well. Sihar’s most trusted lieutenant, fiercest warrior, and rumored lover is **Sewell** (N female human rebel general), a large and muscular woman who always has a smile on her face <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.385,t=0.859,r=0.912,b=0.939), with ID e69f2a3d-30d2-458f-94f1-73c21f1068ab -->

and a lance at her side. While Sihar is the Bright Lions’ leader, Sewell is second in
command, leading most of the Bright Lions military attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.080,r=0.616,b=0.111), with ID 61f80397-95a6-4eb7-b349-0c4a886d904e -->

The backbone of the Bright Lions’ relationship with the people of Mzali is **Azeeko** (LG male human cook), an old, bearded man with a burly frame who runs a tavern called the Golden Mouse—one of the Bright Lions’ headquarters, for those in the know. For all others, the tavern is simply a place to find a decent bed, a good drink, and a home-cooked meal, even for those who don’t have enough coin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.111,r=0.616,b=0.189), with ID 65a4f6e8-a3d3-42f8-a4aa-f5d2a923f823 -->

The eyes and ears of the Bright Lions outside of Mzali are coordinated by the halfling spy **Xor Beannich** (CG nonbinary halfling scout), who met Sihar while the future founder of the Bright Lions was working as a mercenary. With Walkena showing displeasure at the recently liberated nation of Vidrian, Xor has been attempting to gain a hearing with prominent Vidric officials such as Avarneus and Shimali Manux, both to offer a warning and in hopes of gaining allies in the fight against the child god. Xor also handles the subtle and dangerous work of keeping their fellow revolutionaries well-provisioned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.189,r=0.617,b=0.310), with ID f4017f40-ac59-40df-ad5b-ca12b1e1e06f -->

The Bright Lions are always looking for brave souls to help them smuggle weapons and supplies into the city. Not only do their agents need to enter Mzali undetected, but once inside, they need to make sure the secret police don’t suspect where these valuable stockpiles are kept. In particular, alchemical weapons are always in high demand by active Bright Lions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.311,r=0.617,b=0.389), with ID 749c9b93-c210-42ff-a2bb-74780a4570d1 -->

# RIGHTEOUS HERESY
Sihar plans regularly scheduled attacks against Walkena, his many servants, and their religious infrastructure both in and outside Mzali. Inside the city, the Bright Lions work to disrupt daily operations and demonstrations of Walkena’s power, such as interfering with public executions. The Bright Lions have gotten the procedure of their raids down to a science. Their constant duty is to defend the oppressed, which often involves daring rescues followed by close escapes, after which they must hide themselves and those they rescued either in one of their hidden bases of operation or somewhere outside the city. Equally vital to the organization is the task of convincing others whenever possible to join the cause. Walkena has forces outside the city as well to spread his rule across the Mwangi Expanse, and scattered bands of Bright Lions often follow to subtly sabotage supply lines and harry troops. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.397,r=0.617,b=0.586), with ID 4eb08c74-dc8d-4a5e-a9d4-181151d32e4b -->

Yet violence is not the only method that Sihar uses to undermine Walkena’s rule. As a scholar and expert on the Old Sun Gods, Sihar hopes that spreading their word among the people of Mzali will remind citizens of the kinder deities that once watched over the city, and help foment discontent with Walkena’s malicious rule. She also hopes to see her patrons become known in other lands and among other people, so that if the worst happens and the Bright Lions are wiped out, the Old Sun Gods will still be honored. During her time at the Magaambya, she unearthed detailed information and theories on where to find ancient texts and relics within the depths of Mzali’s temples—but retrieving them is considered too dangerous and is not a top priority for the Bright Lions themselves to investigate. Those who can convince Sihar they are trustworthy enough to return any recovered holy items may get her to divulge the location of said treasures. For those who succeed, Sihar can offer not only gold, but something more valuable: her gratitude and favor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.587,r=0.617,b=0.787), with ID 79d3fb52-9d08-41df-b047-319dd2fc6ae9 -->

# OLD SUN GODS
Although once mostly forgotten, the Old Sun Gods have slowly been brought back to the people of Mzali thanks to Sihar and the Bright Lions. The following entries include two elements introduced in _Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods & Magic_. Alternate domains are described on pages _7–8_ of _Gods & Magic_ and can be selected using the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.796,r=0.617,b=0.880), with ID d5166ca5-4871-4844-b04b-7364df067c0f -->

# THE LION’S PRIDE

**Azeeko:** The old cook can most often be found in the kitchen making food—bread in particular—which he distributes to the poor. This generosity has led to Azeeko having the ear of the lowest among the low, and he has used this inroad to gather information and spread word of the Bright Lions’ achievements. At least for now, Walkena’s enforcers have yet to come knocking. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.638,t=0.071,r=0.876,b=0.247), with ID 3be2fe12-9a5c-43df-923c-efc8a36ec030 -->

Sewell: A Mzali native who left the city with her family as a child, Sewell met Sihar when they were both working as mercenaries. Sihar explained her mission and her vision of a prosperous Mzali that didn’t torture its own citizens, one guided by compassion and greatness, not cruelty. Sewell laughed at Sihar’s goals, saying such a thing was impossible, but said she would join if Sihar beat her in an arm-wrestling contest. Sihar did, and since then Sewell has been completely dedicated to Sihar and her mission. Sihar relies on Sewell and trusts her above anyone else, even if Sewell is far quicker to jump to violence than the more prudent Sihar. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.639,t=0.249,r=0.875,b=0.509), with ID ebfeb4ca-236c-4156-8052-645416f00c38 -->

**Xor Beninch:** Xor was the child of foreign merchants who had hired the mercenary company Sihar was a part of at the time, to serve as guards. During their journey they were constantly attacked by monstrous creatures and bandits. By the end of the trip, Xor’s parents were done with all of the dangers of a traveling life, but Xor was hooked. They begged to stay behind and train under Sihar and some of the other mercenaries. When it was time for Sihar to go back to Mzali, with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.639,t=0.511,r=0.877,b=0.703), with ID 852e3700-3b85-4a00-981f-2cf9988d82ba -->

for Sihar to go back to Mzali, with
plans of founding the Bright Lions, Xor
was ready to help. But Mzali’s fascistic
policies against non-Mwangi peoples
made it almost impossible for a halfling
to enter, let alone live in, the city-state.
Wanting to be part of the Bright Lions
but not being able to operate safely
in the city, Xor used their agility and
quick thinking to become the group’s
spymaster, organizing and leading their
allies outside Mzali. They are the first
point of contact with the Bright Lions
and Sihar herself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.640,t=0.696,r=0.878,b=0.910), with ID 28613944-7e9e-4b0d-93e0-c904017b3a47 -->
