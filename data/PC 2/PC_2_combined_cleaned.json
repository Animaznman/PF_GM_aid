But they're even more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen ancestry isn't particularly common in the area where the story takes place, most times you can work with your GM and the other players to find a great way to incorporate that character into the narrative. This discussion might point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure into the game and set the stage for how they interact with the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the accompanying player's guide might include information about additional uncommon options that make sense for that story and its region and grant you automatic access to play them during those adventures.",

Their slight frames and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environment—green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century.",

You don't have to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn. (As normal, you need only one formula for an item to create any level of that item.) • Quick Vial You create a versatile vial that can be used only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your research field (it can't be used to create a consumable, for example).

If there is in fact a larger mystery at play, you can't Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, but you can choose to open an investigation. To do so, define the question at the heart of the mystery, such as \"Where has the priceless work of art that was supposed to hang here been taken?\" or \"Who or what killed this priest?\" Work with your GM to refine the question if need be.

The detail you can investigate is typically a single item, creature, or small location (such as a room or corridor), though the GM might allow a different scope for your investigation.

For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. The question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. \"Is this footprint made of mud?\" is simple for an investigator to answer, but \"Who left these footprints?\" or \"What location did this mud come from?\" both have enough potential for an investigation.",

Perhaps you hail from a culture with strong ancestral traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan), a traditional dwarven community that worships Torag's family pantheon, or a group that reveres Erastil or Pharasma. You might commune with powerful psychopomps who shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself, or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them to meddle in your worldly affairs.",

The following are just some of the possible combinations. - • Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect. - • Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion's reaction and _lay on hands_ to go further. - • Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don't work. - • Ranger alchemists often focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare. - • Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue's poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage. - • Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darkvision elixirs to grant vision in darkness can prepare another spell instead of _darkvision_.",

Darting around in search of cover isn't necessary when you carry your cover with you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a mobile fortress.

As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your \"active companion,\" follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.",

If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner.

As a sentinel, you might be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many grievous injuries and decided enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. While this is less common, it's not less effective. Few will argue against stronger, heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle knows, it's always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won't abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough.

    "text": "# Snarecrafter You're able to take ordinary materials and use them to create deadly snares—special traps that you can rig up quickly when the situation demands. While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes realize that you may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage: they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps you've deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them, some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap right under their foes' feet. Others have found they can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a dangerous foe and handy ally.",

This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art.

Perhaps you have something or someone in your life that you want to protect from the dangers and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue attention from your community. It could also be that you don't like attention and wish to retain the ability",

Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior.

Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC.

Spell traits usually apply only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on how these traits work with spells. Spells with the **concentrate** trait require you to focus on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes), you need to maintain that concentration and can't perform other actions. If your concentration is broken (such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted. Spells with the **manipulate** trait require you to physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the possibility of disrupting your spell.",

Your corona is an aura in a 5-foot emanation that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps with a darkness effect, the corona's glow attempts to counteract the darkness. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can't attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. You can Sustain to flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation or return the corona to a 5-foot emanation.",
