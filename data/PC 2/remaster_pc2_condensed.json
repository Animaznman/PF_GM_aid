But they\u2019re even more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen ancestry isn\u2019t particularly common in the area where the story takes place, most times you can work with your GM and the other players to find a great way to incorporate that character into the narrative. This discussion might point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure into the game and set the stage for how they interact with the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the accompanying player\u2019s guide might include information about additional uncommon options that make sense for that story and its region and grant you automatic access to play them during those adventures.",

Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals.

A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they\u2019re only considered adults around age 12.

For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. The question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. \u201cIs this footprint made of mud?\u201d is simple for an investigator to answer, but \u201cWho left these footprints?\u201d or \u201cWhat location did this mud come from?\u201d both have enough potential for an investigation.",

    "text": "Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a dynamic combat scene between a human martial artist and a large green-skinned monster, set among ancient ruins in a mountainous landscape.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 The main subject is a bald, dark-skinned martial artist in blue and white robes, performing a flying kick to the face of a large, green-skinned, tusked monster.\n  \u2022 The setting is outdoors, with snow-capped mountains in the background and ancient, crumbling stone ruins in the foreground and midground.\n  \u2022 The composition is action-oriented, with the martial artist airborne and the monster recoiling from the impact.\n  \u2022 The colour palette features natural earth tones, greens, blues, and whites, with strong lighting suggesting daylight.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.\n  \u2022 The illustration is highly detailed, with visible musculature, fabric folds, and facial expressions.\n  \u2022 No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 The martial artist is positioned in the right midground, mid-air, with his left leg extended in a kick to the monster\u2019s jaw.\n  \u2022 The monster occupies the left foreground, with its head turned from the impact and one arm raised defensively.\n  \u2022 Ruined stone statues and architectural fragments are scattered around, including a large broken statue head in the lower right.\n  \u2022 The background features towering, snow-covered mountains and a blue sky with a bird in flight.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The illustration conveys a sense of motion, power, and fantasy heroism, emphasizing the martial artist\u2019s agility and strength against a much larger foe.\n  \u2022 The ruined setting and mountainous backdrop enhance the epic and mythic atmosphere of the scene.\n  \u2022 The focus is on the moment of impact, with dynamic poses and dramatic composition drawing the viewer\u2019s eye to the clash between the two characters.",

Darting around in search of cover isn\u2019t necessary when you carry your cover with you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge that you have your most trusted companion at your side: your shield.

These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.",

They form strong connections quickly and attract new familiars everywhere they go. This behavior is less common but is often done out of a high level of respect for the independence of both the adventurer and the familiar, or a strong connection to the ebb and flow of life and the cycle of change that touches all things. You are among these masters and can decide which practice best suits you.",

Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals\u2019 ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement.

While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination.",

Such an occupation comes with frequent injuries that need constant attention. Few parties would ever turn down help from a practicing medic. In fact, the need for medicine is so great that many medics started as adventurers and took up medicine as a necessity. While patching up injuries is the most common practice of medics, they are also invaluable for their ability to help fight diseases and ailments inflicted by all kinds of creatures and traps. The adaptability and utility of the medic are undeniable. Whether you studied medicine for most of your life or picked it up on the road, you are who people turn to for aid.",

The character is dressed in rugged, practical clothing and armor, with a bow slung over their back.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 Main subject is a bald, muscular humanoid figure sitting cross-legged on the ground.\n  \u2022 The figure is wearing a sleeveless, dark green tunic with leather armor, a greenish cloak, and fur-trimmed shorts.\n  \u2022 The character is holding an arrow in one hand and applying a purple substance to its tip with the other hand.\n  \u2022 A bowl containing more of the purple substance rests in their lap.\n  \u2022 A bow is slung over the figure\u2019s back, indicating an archer or ranger archetype.\n  \u2022 The setting is nondescript, with a white background and no visible environment.\n  \u2022 The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and purples.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.\n  \u2022 Lighting is diffuse and even, with soft shadows and highlights accentuating the figure\u2019s musculature and clothing textures.\n  \u2022 The illustration is detailed, with visible fabric textures, leather straps, and fur trim.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 The figure is centrally placed, occupying most of the frame.\n  \u2022 The bowl and the figure\u2019s hands are in the foreground, drawing attention to the act of preparing the arrow.\n  \u2022 The bow and cloak recede into the background, providing context for the character\u2019s role.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The visual focus is on the act of applying the purple substance to the arrow, suggesting a theme of preparation, stealth, or poison use.\n  \u2022 The character\u2019s attire and equipment imply a rugged, survivalist archetype, possibly a ranger, rogue, or assassin in a fantasy setting.\n  \u2022 The earthy and muted color scheme, combined with the practical clothing and gear, reinforces the character\u2019s readiness for action or adventure.",

You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and hopefully your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many grievous injuries and decided enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. While this is less common, it\u2019s not less effective. Few will argue against stronger, heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle knows, it\u2019s always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won\u2019t abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough. You can rely on your armor to see you through whatever tough fights lie ahead, and the odds always seem better when you\u2019re protected.",

Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes realize that you may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage: they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps you\u2019ve deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them, some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap right under their foes\u2019 feet.

But magic is so much more than that\u2014it\u2019s thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You\u2019ve heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master these mystical trinkets.",

This doesn\u2019t prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts; you might need to attempt Deception or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed. In either use of this feat, the recipient is made aware of your efforts on a critical failure (for instance, you might be caught rubbernecking or you might disturb the papers in a way their owner notices).",

Spell traits usually apply only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on how these traits work with spells.\n\nSpells with the **concentrate** trait require you to focus on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes), you need to maintain that concentration and can't perform other actions. If your concentration is broken (such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted.\n\nSpells with the **manipulate** trait require you to physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the possibility of disrupting your spell.",

    "text": "Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the \"Pathfinder Player Core 2\" book, showing a dramatic scene where an armored character uses a glowing healing ability on a wounded companion in a forested setting.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  \u2022 Two characters are central: one in ornate plate armor with a red cape and a large sword on their back, kneeling beside another character in leather and fur armor who is wounded and clutching their side.\n  \u2022 The armored character is channeling a golden, glowing energy from their hand into the wound of the injured character, suggesting a magical healing act.\n  \u2022 The background is a dense, autumnal forest with warm, golden and orange hues, and dappled sunlight filtering through the trees.\n  \u2022 The composition is dynamic, with the healer leaning forward and the wounded character partially reclined, emphasizing urgency and care.\n  \u2022 The text \"LAY ON HANDS\" appears in a decorative label at the bottom left, indicating the name of the depicted ability.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  \u2022 No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.\n  \u2022 The illustration is detailed, with realistic armor textures, foliage, and magical effects.\n  \u2022 The top of the image includes the \"Pathfinder Player Core 2\" branding in gold and green.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  \u2022 The armored healer is positioned on the left, dominating the foreground, while the wounded character is on the right, partially in the background.\n  \u2022 The glowing healing effect is the focal point, drawing the viewer\u2019s eye to the interaction between the two characters.\n  \u2022 The sword and cape create diagonal lines that add movement and depth to the scene.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The image visually communicates the theme of heroism, compassion, and magical healing in a fantasy role-playing context.\n  \u2022 The use of warm colors and light effects enhances the sense of hope and recovery.\n  \u2022 The \"Lay on Hands\" label directly ties the scene to a specific in-game ability, reinforcing the connection between narrative art and game mechanics.",
