# INTRODUCTION

*Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. This book combines with Player Core, expanding on its options and giving you even more ways to play the character you want!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.112,t=0.524,r=0.939,b=0.626), with ID 9e6faf24-c72e-4492-b45a-e104302749ee -->

## MORE OF EVERYTHING
*Player Core 2* provides even more options for player characters. Along with the ancestries and classes summarized on the following page, there are additional general and skill feats, equipment, spells, and treasure round out your characters’ abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.642,r=0.517,b=0.739), with ID 9168328e-f8c8-4bf2-900e-6abb0c934bab -->

Alongside the eight new multiclass archetypes for the
classes in this book, you can find archetypes for all sorts
of characters starting on page 172. These can expand any
Pathfinder character in unexpected directions, helping them
discover new abilities to match their developing stories.
Many of these archetypes support combat specializations,
like the bastion and wrestler, while others show off the
roles characters may be stepping into, like the blessed one
and marshal. Even characters’ growing skills can uncover
deeper specializations, like the archaeologist and medic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.739,r=0.517,b=0.893), with ID bb806a25-d0ae-4f88-ba40-dae1679f523b -->

In addition to an expansive slate of ancestries, this
book also contains three versatile heritages suitable for
characters of any ancestry: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.893,r=0.518,b=0.941), with ID 51bf9509-0b79-4143-a373-387b80dac84d -->

- • Dhampirs are the mortal offspring of vampires, walking the line between life and undeath.
- • Dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits owing to dragons’ influence, either direct or on their ancestors.
- • Duskwalkers are souls reincarnated as a result of a bargain between psychopomps, the guides of the dead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.647,r=0.910,b=0.742), with ID c5762ce1-c037-4a84-ae80-f2989660fbdc -->

## HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The new options in this book expand on those in _Player Core_, and that book is required to use _Player Core 2_. It’s easy to dive in using an ancestry, class, and archetype from this book, but endless variations come to life when combining these with options from _Player Core_ and other sources. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.750,r=0.908,b=0.846), with ID 92fba4e5-ed6a-4761-9463-6d7ab612ed82 -->

If you’re creating a new character, you’re probably interested in the new ancestries (page 7), classes (page 54), and backgrounds (page 50). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.847,r=0.907,b=0.893), with ID 05a8a628-8917-4944-8318-85d18606699b -->

Even characters you’ve already created can benefit from archetypes (page 172), along with new options for feats (page 224), spells (page 236), and items (page 272). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.893,r=0.906,b=0.942), with ID 7844d258-d064-4b0d-906c-b813997f6e2b -->

# CHAPTER 1:
## ANCESTRIES & BACKGROUNDS

*Your character’s ancestry and background tell the story of who you were before you became an adventurer, as well as who you might strive to become one day. But not everyone fits neatly into the most common ancestries or backgrounds. You might be a birdlike tengu, a scaled kobold, or a curious catfolk with a one-of-a-kind background in your story. Perhaps your ancestry carries the blood of dragons or vampires. Only you can decide!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.074,r=0.865,b=0.223), with ID 29513654-b39c-4800-b60a-878b2d013da5 -->

This chapter expands your starting character options from those available in *Player Core* and includes each of the following sections. You can also find a summary of each ancestry and heritage, along with the classes in this book, on page 5 so that you can make the primary decisions for creating your character at a glance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.246,r=0.474,b=0.344), with ID 11b4cda3-f581-4016-9e5e-460053a3b91a -->

- **Catfolk** (page 8), or amurruns, are humanoid felines who believe they were created to protect the wilderness from great danger.
- **Hobgoblins** (page 12) are goblins’ stronger and taller cousins, often devoted to proving themselves in battle.
- **Kholos** (page 16) are hyena-headed humanoids who practice ancestor worship and consume their dead to honor them.
- **Kobolds** (page 20) are diligent crafters whose small, reptilian forms are influenced in the egg by the proximity of powerful magic.
- **Lizardfolk** (page 24), or iruxi, have fanged snouts, long tails, and rich oral traditions.
- **Ratfolk** (page 28), or ysoki, pack into tight spaces and are markedly industrious and fastidious.
- **Tengu** (page 32) are corvid-like humanoids with an affinity for blades and the rumored mystical ability to absorb bad luck.
- **Tripkees** (page 36) are froglike humanoids who rely on their cunning and curiosity to keep their communities safe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.351,r=0.476,b=0.773), with ID 18df5c7a-4fa0-4352-a8c6-5a7fb8321373 -->

# Versatile Heritages
As in _Player Core_, this book presents versatile heritages, which are certain heritages that can occur across all ancestries, and which you can choose instead of one of the heritages listed in your ancestry’s section. For instance, if your father was a vampire, you could be a dhampir whether you’re a human, orc, or catfolk. Rules for versatile heritages are found on page 74 of _Player Core_.
- **Dhampirs** (page 42) are part vampires due to an early connection to vampire blood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.780,r=0.474,b=0.942), with ID 8647f3d8-6d4a-482b-934d-a38cde0a3a82 -->

UNCOMMON ANCESTRIES AND HERITAGES
Each new ancestry in this book is uncommon. Though uncommon elements of the game are usually acquired during play, you choose your ancestry and heritage at the beginning of the game. This means you should talk to your group and GM about which uncommon ancestries and heritages make sense for the story. In the pirate-laden Shackles, tengu are a regular sight. But they’re even more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen ancestry isn’t particularly common in the area where the story takes place, most times you can work with your GM and the other players to find a great way to incorporate that character into the narrative. This discussion might point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure into the game and set the stage for how they interact with the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the accompanying player’s guide might include information about additional uncommon options that make sense for that story and its region and grant you automatic access to play them during those adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.493,t=0.267,r=0.857,b=0.605), with ID 5a0b4cce-f019-4fb2-b71e-50c59b020322 -->

RARE AND UNIQUE BACKGROUNDS  
Some backgrounds have enough story weight that you need to work with the rest of your group to determine if they're right for a particular story, like being heir to a throne. You can find more information about these special backgrounds on page 52. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.493,t=0.609,r=0.856,b=0.719), with ID c5911338-fdb8-4c52-bbb1-d8b5930e4dbe -->

- **Dragonbloods** (page 44) are scions of powerful dragons, often exhibiting their majesty and magic.
- **Duskwalkers** (page 48) are souls reincarnated into mortal form, who are tied to psychopomp guardians. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.738,r=0.863,b=0.819), with ID adb06d18-67b6-4fc3-a3f2-cd229abb08a0 -->

# BACKGROUNDS
This chapter contains new backgrounds for characters
from all walks of life, from couriers to saboteurs. This
section also includes a set of special rare backgrounds
that you and your GM might agree to use in a campaign.

Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine the features of felines and humanoids in both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as the chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. They believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.140,r=0.516,b=0.295), with ID 7c58f30f-2142-4748-9c5d-283ffc93430d -->

As quick as their reflexes are, catfolk have quicker
tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in
an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily
purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.
    If you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly,
and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.296,r=0.515,b=0.388), with ID a639dc14-84c5-4f84-8dab-7ef276ec5e61 -->

Physical Description  
Although all catfolk walk upright and have soft fur, a tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as much variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have nimble fingers with short claws that are usually retractable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.322,r=0.902,b=0.402), with ID cc676a90-8c12-4688-a16b-625b553d89ed -->

Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only a few
months old, but they start their careers at roughly the same
age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.403,r=0.903,b=0.449), with ID b43dc823-6509-414c-852e-6663d59463f1 -->

**Society**
Catfolk call themselves amurruns, although many consider this name to be private. They raise their children in large extended families, where they are given latitude to explore and get into trouble from a remarkably young age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and the majority learn several trades over their lives. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.461,r=0.903,b=0.570), with ID 6345c811-b9b6-47da-960b-2e35efceb3c9 -->

Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader
who speaks on behalf of the community and mediates
disputes. They prefer to deal with grievances by making
an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a
community for a time so the problem can die away. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.572,r=0.903,b=0.647), with ID cf6b507c-8a1b-49ea-bfd5-7fea45e7257e -->

Catfolk are given short names in their youth.
Adolescent catfolk are free to choose a different
name when they first leave home.
  **Sample Names:** Alyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes,
Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin,
Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.648,r=0.904,b=0.739), with ID e7f3431c-bd8b-4f9c-8b18-3b173d1f01ec -->

## Beliefs
Most catfolk believe they were uplifted from great primeval cats to confront the evil abominations despoiling natural places and laboring to unmake reality. Many, however, enjoy the freedom to travel and like to set their own paths in life. Religious catfolk most often practice a nebulous form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the land and the creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.
**Popular Edicts** travel the world, protect natural places, fastidiously maintain your appearance

Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be powerful allies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.138,r=0.516,b=0.359), with ID b4345d39-0494-47c0-a518-25af0c88f1cc -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a goblin-like creature in armor, holding a dagger and a flask, depicted in a dynamic, character-focused pose.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a goblin-like humanoid with blue-gray skin, large pointed ears, and glowing red eyes.
  • The creature is wearing piecemeal armor, including metal pauldrons, a red scarf, and a greenish tunic with yellow diamond patterns.
  • It is holding a dagger in its right hand and a flask or vial in its left, with additional vials and pouches attached to its belt.
  • The pose is aggressive and alert, with the creature baring its sharp teeth.
  • The background is plain white, focusing all attention on the character.
  • The color palette is dominated by muted greens, browns, and metallic grays, with red accents.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.

**Physical Description**  
Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. They’re remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.230,r=0.905,b=0.325), with ID 53f66641-8fbe-4bf6-8609-ec79f19c92a2 -->

Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk,
and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They
reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood
around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.326,r=0.904,b=0.389), with ID 810bb12b-2c0e-460a-b65f-73a456c400c3 -->

Society  
Hobgoblins structure their society after military hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don’t trust it over the strength of their own sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.399,r=0.904,b=0.570), with ID 553e7ffd-2265-422e-b03e-36d2c308cb1f -->

Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple,
though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural
and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter
their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually
in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.
Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both
pointless and presumptuous; an individual's merits and
demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an
association with a particular lineage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.571,r=0.904,b=0.709), with ID 08fb3ede-932d-4633-a134-8e9118f7be1b -->

**Beliefs**
Most hobgoblins prefer to live within established hierarchies. While many consider sentimentality weak, those with mild temperaments have recently found success in diplomacy and international outreach. Faith has little place in hobgoblin society, as many feel it is impractical, though religious hobgoblins can gain a begrudging modicum of acceptance due to their useful healing magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.766,r=0.903,b=0.893), with ID f1bc8a97-ba2f-4f31-98f0-0dedb71f0527 -->

Elf bane Hobgoblin  
Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund goblins to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist Elf Magic reaction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.151,r=0.602,b=0.248), with ID 649944a5-4923-4637-8b87-bd1592e0d460 -->

Runtboss Hobgoblin  
You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.321,r=0.602,b=0.420), with ID b8e35800-9d04-41d5-9cb8-68e34b254e48 -->

Shortshanks Hobgoblin  
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you’ve trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not off-guard while you Climb. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.428,r=0.601,b=0.542), with ID 5d40a1b8-1930-4b17-9154-c669381d8b9a -->

Smokeworker Hobgoblin  
Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations, laboring on projects that bring smoke and fire to the field of battle. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.551,r=0.600,b=0.649), with ID 1c604d0a-d902-4237-9459-a42cb6fa3ebb -->

Warmarch Hobgoblin  
You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but don’t critically fail, to Subsist in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.658,r=0.600,b=0.741), with ID 88ed37c5-27b3-4fba-9fd8-2a59db3ac908 -->

Warrenbred Hobgoblin  
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. While you’re underground, when you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.750,r=0.601,b=0.863), with ID 3fc2665f-8519-4149-9d9b-3aa212532766 -->

The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing maladies.

HOBGOBLIN WEAPON FAMILIARITY        FEAT 1

HOBGOBLIN
You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the hobgoblin trait.

HOBGOBLIN
You are trained to capture deserters, or “leeches.” Make a melee Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can’t reduce a creature’s Speed below 5 feet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.720,r=0.513,b=0.863), with ID 8cd938f8-d8e0-4fdf-9fed-54e5218939ed -->

Kholo have bad reputations as brutal raiders and demon-worshipers. Many believe that kholo are witches, cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex. Kholo are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it’s mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons. Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy’s cunning or strength into the clan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.138,r=0.516,b=0.374), with ID 365d836a-3841-4536-b039-89056e8d90be -->

  • The figure is adorned with various bones, beads, and talismans, including a prominent animal skull hanging from the neck.
  • The character's skin is marked with white tribal patterns and tattoos.
  • The figure stands upright, holding a staff or ceremonial object in one hand and gesturing with the other.
  • The color palette is dominated by earthy tones: browns, tans, reds, and off-whites, with accents of bone white and muted gold.
  • The background is plain white, focusing all attention on the character.

**Physical Description**  
Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are both common. Kholo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and correspondingly stronger. Kholo are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.230,r=0.905,b=0.388), with ID 7c01226a-7a3c-4b68-9695-7a128c59587b -->

Society
Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods— they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.399,r=0.905,b=0.570), with ID eae8cd0e-36e6-4f9d-82d0-e51170e79a46 -->

Newborn kholo are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic). As a kholo reaches certain milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name.
Sample Names: Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia, Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.572,r=0.904,b=0.677), with ID bac985e6-187e-4017-9e96-3d8d3c4c658d -->

**Beliefs**
Kholo have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to life and prioritize results over methods. They are usually loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable varies depending on who they view as “their people.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.690,r=0.903,b=0.785), with ID e10bc29f-8e5c-43a9-ad95-c282b89eb10c -->

Many kholo pay homage to Lamashtu, both as the originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world. However, some kholo often give homage to Calistria and Shelyn. Nethys is the patron of bonekeepers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.787,r=0.902,b=0.845), with ID 67392b4d-f23e-4cc2-94ba-4f5256c8e0b9 -->

Every kobold instinctively understands the importance
of power, and many are inclined to venerate those who
have it, whether they be mighty dragons, cruel fiends,
imperious fey, or even ancient artifacts. Kobolds seek
out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—
after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves
an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs
incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits
(and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren’s
benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters
and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their
territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever
ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove
happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to
their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make
their fortunes in the wider world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.139,r=0.516,b=0.387), with ID 6705a3f2-fdde-4bf4-b813-215b8a127ce2 -->

  • The character wears a dark brown hooded cloak, leather armor, and various belts and straps.
  • Holds a large, curved dagger in the right hand and a tan sack in the left.
  • The pose is dynamic, suggesting readiness or stealth.

**Physical Description**  
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns. Their features often reflect the nature of their warren’s benefactor, such as vestigial draconic wings or glowing crystalline growths. These differences set warrens apart, though all kobolds are generally easily recognizable as such. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.230,r=0.905,b=0.341), with ID 71893804-943b-455f-8122-afad6cd8303e -->

Kobolds mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12
years and living to about 60. Some rare kobolds live even
longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.342,r=0.904,b=0.388), with ID 1c217547-5698-40b2-9665-87c7eab84ad8 -->

## Society
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They’re secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their benefactor’s personality. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.400,r=0.904,b=0.570), with ID 2c2bec76-6c7d-4b32-934d-eba35ecc26c8 -->

A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, they might add more syllables to their names. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.572,r=0.904,b=0.678), with ID 09766276-7d18-485e-97e8-5807d0166211 -->

**Beliefs**
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural
respect for hierarchies and rules, relying on their
ancestral social strategies for survival. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.737,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID 02a04f95-be9b-4e15-98c8-2d280a8cf270 -->

Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds. They’re
often drawn to deities related to their benefactors, such as
Asmodeus if the benefactor is a devil, or dragon deities like
Apsu and Dahak if the benefactor is a dragon. Kobolds also
often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with
powerful magical creatures as figureheads. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.801,r=0.903,b=0.892), with ID a8f0bc24-6c67-4fb1-919b-473f74045d15 -->

Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires
considered ancient even by the elves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.141,r=0.513,b=0.172), with ID 70208e85-e87e-4841-b64b-683df5688818 -->

Lizardfolk move through the societies of other humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators. They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, they usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.172,r=0.514,b=0.326), with ID 2b6a3d12-b93b-4d6b-aff0-1c1c34c74425 -->

  • The background is white, isolating the figure and focusing attention on the subject.
  • Lighting is diffuse and natural, highlighting the textures of the scales and the reflective surfaces of the shells.

Technical Details :

**Physical Description**  
Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.322,r=0.904,b=0.450), with ID dbbe8f29-384f-46f5-8289-86e861b77cce -->

Society
Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back thousands of years, brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future. If they seem slow to act, it's because their long history has taught them the value of patience. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.461,r=0.904,b=0.616), with ID c279e081-010e-40bb-be89-1c9a453f40e2 -->

True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they are partially or mostly submerged in water. Lizardfolk bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when the residents are in danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.618,r=0.903,b=0.693), with ID a1f94426-f9bb-477b-9303-794c89e62467 -->

Lizardfolk names are typically chosen by the clan’s astrologer in accordance to omens and which star signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.545,t=0.694,r=0.902,b=0.739), with ID 6d4c9b21-a93d-47b0-ae8f-4bae95a572d5 -->

Beliefs
Most iruxis are unconcerned with heavy questions of morality and focus their efforts on a local level. Iruxi religion plays a large role in their culture, but in a heavily practical way, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered.

Cloudleaper Lizardfolk

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a humanoid lizard creature holding a glowing, rune-inscribed scroll, rendered in a painterly digital art style.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a muscular, anthropomorphic lizard or dragonborn figure standing upright.
  • The creature has scaly skin, a long tail, clawed feet and hands, and a reptilian head with prominent brow ridges and yellow eyes.
  • It is holding a glowing blue scroll or magical artifact with runic symbols, emitting blue light and wisps of energy.
  • The figure wears minimal clothing: a tattered loincloth, leather straps, and some armor on the shoulders.
  • The background is mostly white, with a partial green border on the right edge.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references present.
  • No visible text except for the runic symbols on the scroll, which are stylized and not standard alphabet.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the blue glow from the scroll illuminating the creature’s torso and face.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature is centered, facing forward, with its tail curving behind to the right.
  • The scroll is held in both hands at chest height, becoming the focal point due to its glow.
  • The composition uses a three-quarters view, showing both the front and side of the figure.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the magical or mystical nature of the character, likely suggesting a spellcaster or shaman archetype.
  • The blue glow and runes draw attention to the scroll as a source of power or knowledge.
  • The pose and musculature convey strength, while the magical artifact suggests intelligence or wisdom. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.395,r=0.896,b=0.976), with ID 21ca1d46-012a-4bf7-bac3-21ad59617d05 -->

Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids refer to as “ratfolk.” They are a communal people who prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals living in a given home. If they can’t find homes in town, ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.140,r=0.515,b=0.250), with ID d3726163-3a39-4b54-ab01-91d99d19499b -->

Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found
on the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with
their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything
out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re
also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed
full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous
generations and stowed away in preparation for some
future emergency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.250,r=0.516,b=0.372), with ID 0d8ce49d-ed29-42b2-b467-94497f6f2208 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of an anthropomorphic mouse warrior, depicted in dynamic motion with a sword and a red fur-trimmed cape.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a humanoid mouse with brown fur, large ears, and a long tail, dressed in medieval-style adventurer clothing.
  • The mouse is wielding a large sword in its right hand and appears to be leaping or lunging forward.
  • The character wears a red cape with a white fur trim, which flows dramatically behind, suggesting movement.
  • The mouse has a leather belt with pouches and a dagger sheath, and is dressed in dark, stitched clothing with visible seams and patches.
  • The background is plain white, focusing all attention on the character.
  • The colour palette is dominated by earthy browns, greys, and the vibrant red of the cape.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration is rendered in a painterly digital art style with soft shading and detailed fur texture.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The mouse is positioned diagonally, with the head and sword at the upper right and the tail and feet at the lower left.
  • The cape occupies the left side of the image, balancing the sword on the right.
  • The composition uses dynamic angles and foreshortening to convey action and depth.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of agility, bravery, and readiness for battle, typical of heroic fantasy character art.
  • The dramatic pose and flowing cape emphasize movement and the adventurous nature of the character. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.607,r=0.541,b=0.946), with ID 3acf9d28-5602-4757-98e3-93ba7e5d86af -->

**Physical Description**  
Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a single family group can exhibit substantial variation in hair color, eye color, or size. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.136,r=0.905,b=0.249), with ID f1b0ede3-0354-4187-ae55-1ed04bbffb6e -->

Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though
this is also reinforced through their strong social
structures. Because their appearance is often considered
disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even
mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their
physical features with layers of clothing when moving
through spaces dominated by other ancestries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.249,r=0.906,b=0.359), with ID fa3e9873-2dd5-4e2a-8cff-f3c28e4b324c -->

## Society
Ysoki culture values cooperation and community. Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.368,r=0.904,b=0.527), with ID 5ddf01f3-f4d1-4678-ae53-eaa08a8d2a45 -->

Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and endure them only when outside their communities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.526,r=0.905,b=0.617), with ID d773e6a4-4731-4680-a828-aa699303d864 -->

**Sample Names:** Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak, Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.563,t=0.618,r=0.905,b=0.665), with ID 41cf1656-bee4-4394-95a6-0eecfa93b7f3 -->

**Beliefs**  
Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they also obey strict social codes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.534,t=0.674,r=0.905,b=0.754), with ID b880883a-80ac-4610-86dc-996ed162ef97 -->

Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to
acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area,
Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother
Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to
ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own
interests above others. To most ratfolk,
Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those
things they need done, but which they
would not wish to do.

However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.214,r=0.602,b=0.327), with ID eed6af45-6c14-44db-ad8c-61abbb0ddceb -->

Longsnout Rat  
Your long snout gives you a keener sense of smell than most ratfolk. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained on page 433 of the Player Core. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek a creature or object within the range of your scent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.337,r=0.600,b=0.465), with ID c605a13f-74e0-4ea1-94de-0f18962cd4e9 -->

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.

The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengu notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental, though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has often led some to regard them with suspicion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.203,r=0.515,b=0.341), with ID 40afb1c2-dbaf-46a0-89c7-0c7654b9482e -->

Physical Description  
Tengu have many avian characteristics. Their faces are tipped with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms and lower legs end in talons. As closed footwear tends to fit poorly unless custom made, many tengu wear open sandals or simply go barefoot. Tengu are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they are even lighter than their smaller frames would suggest, as they have hollow bones. A small number of tengu have vestigial wings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.306,r=0.905,b=0.449), with ID ce824b39-df37-4958-92c9-b8e6b85587a7 -->

Society  
   The greatest divide in tengu society is between tengu remaining in their ancestral home and those who have dispersed across the world. Tengu refer to these two groups as those “in the roost” and those “migrating,” respectively. Roosted tengu tend to be more traditionalist and conservative and are especially concerned with preserving their culture in the face of years of erosion from oppression. Migrating tengu, on the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture of the various nations and settlements that they now call home.  
   Roosted tengu tend toward more traditional names, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.460,r=0.905,b=0.648), with ID 06d6fc80-36a0-4465-8dec-58591e25490e -->

Roosted tengu tend toward more traditional names,

**Beliefs**
Tengu often follow the faith of the region in which they were raised, though the tengu ancestral deity is the storm god Hei Feng. Before their diaspora, tengu practiced a syncretic faith that blended a polytheistic worship of the deities responsible for creating the natural world. As tengu folklore posits that tengu long ago descended from the night sky on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion’s highest peaks, animist rites were practiced on mountains and other great natural features. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.736,r=0.903,b=0.892), with ID 28dbb751-2961-4999-94aa-8a519db15562 -->

Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest
their homes’ bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as
natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger
predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools
has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as
rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill
in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged
causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are
most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade,
explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.220,r=0.514,b=0.372), with ID 66196f27-0961-4b27-9cea-cbb262da1a5a -->

## Physical Description
Tripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environment—green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they’re only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.138,r=0.906,b=0.342), with ID 73ae2989-3c72-427b-8b19-332b81c84a5c -->

## Society
Tripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle within which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist’s eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved tripkee lives and lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.353,r=0.905,b=0.539), with ID bdb477a8-e504-43f6-8828-70ad15641954 -->

Tripkee names often include resonant vowels and
chirped consonants that remain difficult for non-
tripkees to vocalize properly. Tripkees that travel widely
often adopt one or more names more easily replicated
by their associates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.541,r=0.904,b=0.617), with ID ec8da5b6-891f-47dd-af46-49e32231c451 -->

Beliefs  
Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes of life and death, many tripkees adopt patient attitudes. Those who take a more active role suppressing cruelty may join organizations that blend religion and philosophy, such as the tripkee fiend-keepers who absorb an unholy being into their soul to contain and eventually transform its villainy through their own virtuous acts. Nature deities like Gozreh or Erastil often earn tripkees’ respect, yet communities usually prefer less prominent, more intimate divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or the fey Eldest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.675,r=0.904,b=0.861), with ID 32a083a5-0d72-4773-9f6c-15540dca3d6b -->

Trigger A creature with the animal, beast, elemental, fey, fungus, or plant trait attacks you, and you can see the attacker.
Your canny understanding of natural and primal creatures helps you predict and dodge their attacks. The triggering attack roll targets your Nature DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty against the attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.076,r=0.516,b=0.236), with ID 94c859a3-be63-490f-a03c-ca968acb091e -->

# VERSATILE HERITAGES
*The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage. For more information about versatile heritages, see pages 74–75 of* Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.071,r=0.912,b=0.194), with ID cec91fef-e58f-4d5e-bd35-87c0e02f16d9 -->

The most common versatile heritages by far are those born from the pairing of two different ancestries, such as the aiuvarin and dromaar mixed heritages (*Player Core* 82). Other individuals are born under far stranger circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these circumstances aren’t unique to a single ancestry, these heritages are likewise shared by many ancestries. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.218,r=0.515,b=0.341), with ID a983a8c6-4b14-4ed2-b2fd-f74e68f14616 -->

Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages.
Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through
specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many,
however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy,
whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors,
or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that
plane. These individuals are known as planar scions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.342,r=0.516,b=0.449), with ID cdec1abb-8f3d-40c7-86ea-3c95b9759087 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration of a "Dhampir," depicted in a dynamic, action-ready pose with weapons and armor, likely for a role-playing game or fantasy sourcebook.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid character in a crouched, combat-ready stance, holding a sword in each hand.
  • The character wears a hooded cloak, leather armor with multiple buckles, and protective gear on the shoulders, knees, and shins.
  • The color palette is dominated by muted browns, purples, and dark blues, giving a stealthy, nocturnal impression.
  • The character's face is partially obscured by the hood and is not visible.
  • The word "DHAMPIR" appears in a stylized label at the bottom of the image, identifying the character's type or race.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is digital, with clean lines and shading to suggest depth and texture.
  • The character is equipped with multiple weapons, including two swords and several daggers or tools attached to the belt.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is positioned diagonally across the frame, with one leg extended forward and the other bent, suggesting movement or readiness to strike.
  • The cloak billows behind, adding a sense of motion and drama.
  • The composition places the character centrally, with the weapons and armor details clearly visible.

Analysis :
  • The visual message emphasizes agility, preparedness, and a dark, possibly vampiric or supernatural theme, consistent with the "Dhampir" label.
  • The use of dark colors and dynamic pose suggests a stealthy, combat-oriented character archetype. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.453,r=0.540,b=0.941), with ID e00dea17-a41b-474c-82b7-b9f072a31c34 -->

Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile
heritages aren’t limited to a single ancestry, a versatile
heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any
ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common
among certain ancestries than others, and some might list
additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM
may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use
a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.218,r=0.905,b=0.344), with ID 881671e9-421d-47de-a777-1ed2c79b2f09 -->

# PLAYING A VERSATILE HERITAGE
To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.351,r=0.905,b=0.526), with ID 90d5235d-4704-4ac3-a575-684a0f874994 -->

Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have
only one, and you can't have any other heritage in
addition to your versatile heritage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.526,r=0.904,b=0.571), with ID 70844366-bb83-4496-8357-f2a354a91d09 -->

Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an
ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry.
In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting
abilities your character has. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.572,r=0.904,b=0.632), with ID 3d249ee4-7ece-46ad-b72a-f58ebcec19d0 -->

When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from
those available to your ancestry as well as those specific
to your versatile heritage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.632,r=0.904,b=0.679), with ID 903547c6-eb53-4238-87c0-fbd4250a8652 -->

Lineage Feats  
Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage your character has—such as the type of vampire that birthed a dhampir character, or the type of dragon that influenced a dragonblood’s birth. You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out of this feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.689,r=0.904,b=0.818), with ID 8c50bb88-7277-4676-b7a9-e79115b50c4c -->

# Roleplaying a Versatile Heritage
As most versatile heritages are uncommon or rare, playing a character with a versatile heritage generally offers unique and sometimes challenging roleplaying opportunities. The origins of a character’s versatile heritage immediately offers a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.537,t=0.827,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID 4ea2cdc3-7166-4fbe-8dde-afb3902ad08c -->

ANCESTRIES & BACKGROUNDS <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.560,t=0.018,r=0.868,b=0.045), with ID 74b42415-e9fe-48a1-ae6b-47ef4cbdfefa -->

strong chance to create an interesting and compelling
background for your character. While obvious events
related to a character’s birth, such as having unique
parentage, offer explanations for a character’s versatile
heritage, this might also be a good opportunity to create
an even more personalized explanation for the heritage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.080,r=0.470,b=0.172), with ID 98b28583-5ee1-4cd6-8173-25f3e44ec50d -->

For example, a dhampir character could have been born due to long-term exposure to void energy, transforming the character before birth. A dragonblood character might have earned the blessing of a powerful dragon at some point during their adult life, changing the character into a dragonblood far later than usual. The circumstances—well-known or otherwise—of a duskwalker's death could be full of interesting story potential. Players of characters with versatile heritages are encouraged to work with their GMs and fellow players to create interesting origin ideas without monopolizing the spotlight at the table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.173,r=0.470,b=0.356), with ID b7113945-a3e0-45f8-b5b4-5fa607320612 -->

A versatile heritage can influence not only a character’s
origins, but also their outlook and personality. The
nature of a versatile heritage causes a character to
stand out among most cultures and societies. In many
cases, a versatile heritage might isolate a character.
This can manifest in distrust of the character’s origins,
an unhealthy fixation with the character, or any other
unfortunately othering responses from strangers. The
isolation that comes from these reactions could cause a
character to become bitter or withdrawn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.357,r=0.469,b=0.509), with ID 65addeb3-465d-462d-abdb-befd0ded79a3 -->

The nature of the versatile heritage could also lead
to the character having to “live in two worlds.” A
character of mixed ancestry heritage might need to learn
two different sets of cultures and societal expectations.
Learning to navigate these expectations can come with
its own roleplaying challenges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.510,r=0.469,b=0.602), with ID fee96dba-8c31-45de-97cd-221b202f8141 -->

Of course, players who would rather ignore all of these
roleplaying opportunities and challenges are encouraged
to do so as well. Roleplaying a character should be a
rewarding and exciting experience overall, and removing
these additional aspects is perfectly reasonable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.602,r=0.469,b=0.679), with ID 5dfde699-acad-4a46-80fe-849c3f0b1f38 -->

Dhampir  
The mortal offspring of undead vampires are caught between life and undeath, mortality and immortality, mundane existence and powerful magic. Dhampirs enjoy long life spans and otherworldly charm, but their ghostly pallor and the nature of their parentage make their lives in humanoid societies difficult. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.736,r=0.431,b=0.877), with ID 7cb16019-ca05-4d14-b97b-f7979be8dbaa -->

The two lineages for dhampirs found here are svetochers, who come from the most common vampires called moroi, and straveikas, born of aged and unsettling nosferatus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.879,r=0.454,b=0.940), with ID 9ebf1754-ea30-40ae-90c4-a1d1d9a510fa -->

Dragonblood  
While there are many ways a mortal can be imbued with draconic powers, dragonbloods have an inherent natural affinity. Children born of draconic lineage or blessed by a dragon deity find themselves skirting the line of mortal and dragon, often taking on draconic appearances and boasting strong personalities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.076,r=0.859,b=0.189), with ID 8331a4ab-f0f3-41f5-a74e-8f70f424e4e6 -->

The four lineages for dragonbloods found here are
represented by the traditions of magic from which a
dragon is born. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.189,r=0.860,b=0.234), with ID c42399fc-dc41-48b8-b7ba-d83896be4459 -->

Planar Scions: Duskwalker  
A duskwalker isn’t born; they are instead created, each manifesting as a mortal child in a location with close ties to death. They embody the somber powers of the psychopomps, immortal guardians and shepherds of the dead, and they maintain a fascination with and deep understanding of death throughout their lives. More singular than other versatile heritages, duskwalkers don’t have different lineages. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.245,r=0.861,b=0.372), with ID 3b5b91f3-d535-434e-a077-c50a04229321 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration of a figure labeled "Duskwalker," depicted in a dramatic pose with magical effects and detailed costume elements.

Many call vampires the children of the night, but it’s
dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal
offspring of vampires walk the line between life and
undeath not just physiologically, but also in their
social standing, temperament, and worldview. The
circumstances surrounding a dhampir’s birth are rare,
complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors. Some
dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric
parent, while others are born to those who were turned
into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from
occult rituals or other supernatural influences that
impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life
of a dhampir is often difficult; few vampiric parents
have the inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal
communities find a dhampir’s sallow flesh, piercing eyes,
and unnerving presence off-putting at best. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.138,r=0.515,b=0.389), with ID b2f1488b-2bb5-4e19-aa7b-6115f9c8e086 -->

Summary : This is a full-body fantasy illustration of a humanoid character in elaborate green attire, holding a book and gesturing with one hand.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid figure dressed in a striking, tailored green coat with pointed shoulders and silver trim.
  • The character holds a closed book with ornate cover and visible red bookmark in the left hand, while the right hand is raised in a dramatic, spell-casting gesture.
  • The figure stands upright, facing forward, with feet apart and head slightly turned.
  • The colour palette is dominated by deep green, silver, and black, with accents of red (jewel at the collar and bookmark).
  • The background is plain white, isolating the character.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • The illustration is detailed, with attention to fabric texture, metallic elements, and accessories.
  • No on-image text or UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :

  • The right arm is extended outward, fingers splayed, suggesting action or spellcasting.
  • The figure’s coat features layered panels and chains, adding depth and complexity to the outfit.
  • The character’s shoes are metallic and reflect light, anchoring the figure visually.

Analysis :
  • The visual message conveys a sense of authority, arcane knowledge, and theatrical presence, likely representing a wizard, mage, or similar fantasy archetype.
  • The green and silver colour scheme, along with the book and gesture, emphasize magical or scholarly themes.
  • The composition and costume details suggest a character of importance or power within a fantasy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.391,r=0.517,b=0.948), with ID 9a384e37-ddc0-4eab-980b-871899ffd817 -->

Despite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to
vitality and void energy as if they were undead, making
them unwelcome in many holy communities and often
driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren’t
immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals,
with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have
difficulty producing children of their own, and those few
born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.141,r=0.907,b=0.264), with ID 9ba5fb35-b401-4acc-bc08-33b7aa8905ac -->

A dhampir generally resembles a member of their non-
vampire parent’s ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and
eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and
no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly
as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace,
beauty, and charm despite their unsettling appearance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.265,r=0.906,b=0.358), with ID 67b7561e-6357-434e-839e-d66a2c6f5dc4 -->

Dragons are powerful creatures, and many have
involved themselves deeply in the lives of others. Some
might be treated with reverence by a group of smaller
humanoids, acting as their protector or, in rare cases,
deity incarnate. Others take on a humanoid form to live
within a civilization as their neighbors’ equal, sometimes
hiding their true identity to observe or manipulate.
Whatever the dragon’s intent or actions during these
times, they leave an indelible impression on the people
they encounter, whether or not those people realize it. A
child may be born as the result of such an influence, and
these offspring are known as dragonbloods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.139,r=0.516,b=0.326), with ID 3b30e0b0-fceb-4d58-9f0e-61c73eeda3e4 -->

A dragonblood may be born from any ancestry and found in just about any region of Golarion, as dragons tend to go where they please. Some dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits, from clawed hands to leathery wings to a mighty reptilian tail; these features always resemble similar aspects of the dragonblood’s draconic forebear. For instance, the scion of an adamantine <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.326,r=0.515,b=0.435), with ID 2f9d2572-7c73-4179-9550-770fb996ed27 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration depicting a humanoid dragon-like warrior wielding a sword, labeled "PRIMAL DRAGONBLOOD".

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a green-scaled, anthropomorphic dragon warrior in a dynamic combat pose.
  • The character is holding a large sword with both hands, raised as if preparing to strike.
  • The figure wears chainmail armor, leather belts, and boots, with a sword sheath at the waist.
  • The head features prominent horns, a snout, and reptilian eyes.
  • The label "PRIMAL DRAGONBLOOD" appears at the bottom in a stylized plaque.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • Lighting is even, with no strong shadows, suggesting a studio or digital render.
  • The background is fully removed (white/transparent), isolating the character.
  • The color palette is dominated by greens (scales), metallic grays (armor), and browns (leather).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is centered, occupying most of the frame.
  • The sword extends diagonally from the upper left to the lower right.
  • The pose is dynamic, with bent knees and a forward-leaning stance, suggesting readiness for combat.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the strength and readiness of the "PRIMAL DRAGONBLOOD" character, likely intended for use in a fantasy role-playing or gaming context.
  • The detailed armor and weaponry, along with the dynamic pose, convey a sense of action and heroism. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.125,t=0.443,r=0.515,b=0.943), with ID 118bdce8-844e-4774-b7d3-e04b7ada51d5 -->

dragon might have thick, plate-like scales on their chest.  
Other dragonbloods more closely resemble dragons than  
the other half of their heritage, leading many to mistake  
them for kobolds, iruxis, or other reptilian ancestries;  
such dragonbloods who are proud of their draconic  
lineage are quick to point out this mistake. There are  
also those dragonbloods whose outward appearances  
suggest only a hint of dragon blood. They might have  
a barely noticeable sheen to their skin or the small  
nubs of horns, but they often have an outsized force of  
personality or innate magical abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.141,r=0.905,b=0.311), with ID 5233c3c8-c876-4df3-89b6-7a252351f7e5 -->

Areas in which dragons have more influence or cultural
significance see a higher population of dragonbloods
than other places. The countries of Tian Xia are often
referred to as the Dragon Empires due to the fact that
many dragons take active roles in local humanoid
societies. A leader in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings
who takes on a curse from killing a linnorm might
find that the eyes of their next offspring glow with an
eldritch light. Communities that pay homage to the
dragon gods Apsu or Dahak can also be blessed with
dragonblood births. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.311,r=0.904,b=0.480), with ID fc9c40ad-5d71-487a-989a-8cef8b573ba6 -->

- You might...

Dragonblood (Uncommon Heritage)
You’re descended in some way from a dragon. Your physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power.
  You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry’s list of additional languages (allowing you to choose it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.735,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 0556d1a7-66a2-4f87-8284-a52198aff159 -->

## DRACONIC EXEMPLARS
Some abilities reference your draconic exemplar, which is a specific type of dragon from which you draw your draconic powers—typically the type of dragon whose blood runs in your veins. You can choose your exemplar when you create your character, but are only required to choose one when you select a feat or other option that requires you to have one (such as Breath of the Dragon). This means your draconic nature might be a mystery to you for some time.

The table below lists the dragons from Monster Core and their specifications. The dragon breath entry lists if the given breath uses a Fortitude (F), Reflex (R), or Will (W) saving throw. If you choose a dragon from a different source, work with your GM to determine if you have access to it.

The first duskwalkers manifested as the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps, the immortal guardians and guides of souls after death. One believed that souls who helped preserve the cycle of life and death—but had their own lives cut short—deserved reincarnation, while the other felt this would too greatly violate that same cycle. In the end, duskwalkers rose from a concession between the two psychopomps: such rebirths could occur, but in limited frequency. Only a finite number of duskwalkers ever exist at any one point in time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.139,r=0.516,b=0.309), with ID 070abf0f-b50f-4098-ba49-7119de49a7fb -->

When a duskwalker perishes and faces final judgment,
a new one incarnates within a year from a deserving soul,
typically somewhere far from the previous duskwalker’s
birthplace. Duskwalkers manifest in locations with
a sanctified connection to death, such as graveyards <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.311,r=0.515,b=0.390), with ID e9a11a5f-8545-435b-b1ef-fcf0a4a1d8c6 -->

duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological

Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the

deep respect for that cycle and pushes the duskwalker
toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as
hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.203,r=0.905,b=0.281), with ID 6c1e4a8d-779a-494a-a7c2-83cb9adc3bd0 -->

REFUGEE                                    BACKGROUND  
You come from a land very distant from the one you now find  
yourself in, driven by war, plague, or simply in the pursuit of

SCAVENGER                        BACKGROUND
You've made a living sorting through the things society throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you've left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.

SERVANT                BACKGROUND
You held a role of servitude, waiting on nobles and engendering their trust as one of the confidantes of the household.

TAX COLLECTOR                        BACKGROUND
Reviled but required, you were sent when taxes were due. Performing your job might have required travel and persuasion, or perhaps you were responsible for collecting taxes on trade.

WARD                BACKGROUND
When you were young, you became the ward of another house—
boarded, fed, and educated, but never quite a part of the family.
Perhaps you had to tend to their needs in return for feeding and
raising you, or perhaps you were provided for but disregarded.
Now, adventuring is your chance to grow and roam free. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.381,r=0.863,b=0.479), with ID 1a674f4d-26b9-404b-9ead-3075a40260c4 -->

# RARE BACKGROUNDS
*While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.074,r=0.906,b=0.143), with ID 58181aa2-50be-45db-8255-a45a3b496776 -->

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether
a character with the royalty background is heir to the
throne of the kingdom where your campaign takes place
or to a distant but powerful nation in the same world,
the character is situated in a special position within the
narrative. Your character’s background is an intrinsic
part of where they come from and not something they
earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be
chosen only after a discussion between the GM and
the other players as to whether one would apply for a
particular character in your group’s game. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.171,r=0.515,b=0.372), with ID 710142a5-8114-4d2b-af84-6d417d0b3edf -->

Backgrounds can also be unique, such that no other
character can have them if your character does. To create
unique backgrounds, you can adapt the rare backgrounds
in this section by including more specific details. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.373,r=0.514,b=0.434), with ID c4fd360c-34f5-4f05-9576-62115013a0c9 -->

AMNESIAC

BACKGROUND

RARE
Your background is… well… honestly, you can’t remember! You might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people or situations, but ultimately you don’t know who you once were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover yourself. It’s up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of your character’s backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it’s a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should determine a few noteworthy details about your character or their belongings to get the first clues to your past. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.444,r=0.515,b=0.647), with ID dd2f4370-98a3-47df-afe3-8b56ff548db9 -->

You gain three free attribute boosts. You choose two, and the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your character's possible history. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.648,r=0.514,b=0.694), with ID 9767ad01-c182-4ee7-8a71-e012ffeaaf32 -->

BLESSED                                            BACKGROUND

RARE
You have been blessed by a divinity. For an unknown reason, and irrespective of your actual beliefs, a deity has granted you a boon to use for good or ill. Your blessing grants wisdom and insight to aid you in your struggles. You may or may not even know the identity of the being who blessed you, and the blessing might come with a cost you discover later on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.704,r=0.514,b=0.831), with ID 0bc96306-6ffd-459d-bfee-87a6e9a303aa -->

You are trained in a Lore skill associated with the deity who blessed you (such as Shelyn Lore) if you know their identity, or else in a Lore skill of the GM’s choice if you don’t. Either you can cast guidance as a divine innate spell at will, or you gain a similar blessing determined by the GM. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.863,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID dd5538c3-a008-460b-9093-04739c4a9772 -->

CURSED                                    BACKGROUND
RARE
You are the victim of a personal or hereditary curse. Through great effort and occult study, you have learned to fend off the curse’s worst effects and, by extension, you can protect yourself against other harmful magic. However, the curse still hangs over you and sometimes manifests in dangerous ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.167,r=0.904,b=0.280), with ID ededde43-0d1f-43ae-88ca-58d6960e700e -->

You are trained in Occultism and Curse Lore. You gain the Warding Sign reaction. You and the GM should determine the full effects of the curse, though you’ve staved most of them off for now. The GM determines the curse’s lingering manifestations on you, which usually include at least a constant or very frequent thematic effect and occasional more dangerous effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.311,r=0.902,b=0.402), with ID 83d77f04-0c69-4ae1-9b49-fd32519b41fd -->

FERAL CHILD                                    BACKGROUND

RARE
You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

FEYBOUND                BACKGROUND

RARE
You have spent time in the First World or another realm of the fey and aren’t entirely the same person you were before. Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case, willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey, the benefits of which come at a price. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.706,r=0.903,b=0.831), with ID 71f9ca20-a8d2-43d2-b05a-eb358ac62ad4 -->

You are trained in Fey Lore and gain the Fey’s Fortune free
action. You gain an anathema as part of your pact with the
fey. If you violate this anathema, you lose Fey’s Fortune until
you receive the effects of a successful *atone* ritual using the
Nature skill. The exact anathema is up to you and the GM, but <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.863,r=0.902,b=0.938), with ID 0c0683bb-f030-49d3-aa69-0b57c8b40826 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration showing a woman in a red and gold dress escaping from a tall castle tower using a knotted rope, with birds flying around her and a lush landscape in the background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a woman in an ornate red and gold dress, wearing a crown and necklace, descending the exterior of a tall, cylindrical stone tower using a knotted rope.
  • She is positioned mid-air, gripping the rope with one hand and bracing her feet against the tower wall.
  • A large sword is strapped to her back, and her hair and dress are flowing as if caught by the wind.
  • Several birds (likely pigeons or doves) are flying around her, some close to the tower and others in the open sky.
  • The background features a panoramic view of green fields, trees, and a castle courtyard with people visible below.
  • The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting daytime, with a soft, painterly style and a vibrant, warm color palette.
  • The word "ROYALTY" appears in a gold badge at the bottom right corner.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with attention to fabric texture, stonework, and landscape.
  • No on-image UI elements except for the "ROYALTY" badge.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The woman is in the foreground, dominating the right side of the image, with the tower wall providing vertical structure.
  • The birds are distributed at various depths, enhancing the sense of height and movement.
  • The castle and landscape recede into the background, providing depth and context.
  • The composition uses a dynamic diagonal created by the rope and the woman's body, emphasizing action and escape.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a dramatic moment of escape or adventure, blending elements of royalty, danger, and freedom.
  • The presence of the sword and crown suggests the woman is a royal figure taking bold action.
  • The birds and flowing garments enhance the sense of motion and height, while the expansive landscape underscores the scale of her descent.
  • The "ROYALTY" badge reinforces the theme of noble or regal identity. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.058,r=0.875,b=0.523), with ID 0908f7d1-979d-4419-abe1-a7e358845dbc -->

HAUNTED

RARE

You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood or since a momentous event. You and others may have seen this entity. You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery. Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle ways, and not always for the better. Sometimes the entity helps you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful. The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations.

You are trained in Occultism and an additional skill in which the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any time you attempt a skill check for the entity’s skill, the GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial frightened value can’t be reduced by effects that would reduce or prevent the condition (such as a fighter’s bravery). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.817,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 75d3cdaa-322d-4b59-8a13-528db538de8c -->

ROYALTY

RARE

You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have eschewed the daily routines of royal life and taken up an adventurous quest—perhaps you’re a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a sovereign’s heir on a secret mission.

# ALCHEMIST

[inline micro-figure: round icon with a brown potion bottle and green background]

There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You’re fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you’re constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.044,t=0.064,r=0.868,b=0.226), with ID 68ce3173-9130-4bfc-8df5-32e0049a45db -->

KEY ATTRIBUTE
Intelligence
At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.254,r=0.330,b=0.343), with ID ed8ea0a6-9fe6-4b4f-a914-5d6546140198 -->

HIT POINTS  
8 plus your Constitution Modifier  
You increase your maximum number  
of HP by this number at 1st level and  
every level thereafter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.342,t=0.255,r=0.588,b=0.347), with ID 5bce41bd-9641-456b-8d57-388f2015bcc2 -->

**During combat encounters...**
You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. You might even use mutagens to warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.365,r=0.603,b=0.437), with ID bb04b488-84ff-4645-ac63-9cb9174651bc -->

**During social encounters...**
You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.443,r=0.602,b=0.496), with ID 29c94a15-88c8-4e47-b8b8-322b636ac584 -->

While exploring...
You keep an eye out for additional ingredients that you can turn into alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.504,r=0.602,b=0.573), with ID d1b24e2b-aa91-421e-9471-a051f20b3bc4 -->

**In downtime...**
You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.582,r=0.601,b=0.634), with ID e6962ea8-c4b8-4e9d-aa64-c731ead7d94c -->

- You might...
- • Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
- • Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you’ve made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
- • Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.643,r=0.602,b=0.742), with ID b09fab34-4d9c-45f4-b35e-dea9fb2ecbac -->

- **Others probably...**
  - Think you’re some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don’t understand that you don’t cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception.
  - Don’t understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
  - Assume that if you haven’t caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.751,r=0.602,b=0.864), with ID 4b9ebe5d-c00c-4f9d-9a83-71652e51ae50 -->

## Class Features
You gain these abilities as an alchemist. Abilities gained at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to the features’ names. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.597,r=0.514,b=0.665), with ID bd11713c-68bc-4a16-80e7-29b3ea0ab517 -->

Ancestry and Background  
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.674,r=0.513,b=0.741), with ID 95cf3c6e-303d-483f-b760-0a6adcc37253 -->

Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.751,r=0.512,b=0.801), with ID 0136ba53-8c1e-410e-bd69-edc8064389f4 -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.801,r=0.512,b=0.878), with ID 47f2311d-5e1d-4a6f-abbd-c08b0e0a98f3 -->

**Initial Proficiencies**  
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.889,r=0.512,b=0.941), with ID 7ef8024c-3088-4309-b79d-21e5d6f1f5ec -->

Alchemy  
You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don’t understand your strange science. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.078,r=0.905,b=0.233), with ID 4d11f74c-4d25-4cfa-b670-78f1d3957422 -->

You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (*Player Core* 252), and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.234,r=0.904,b=0.280), with ID 78150b8d-8e25-41b6-a2bf-1cc7d296d2f6 -->

Formula Book  
An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book for free (Player Core 288). The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. The catalog of alchemical items begins on page 281. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.292,r=0.903,b=0.417), with ID 27042193-aa2e-45b3-b6ac-b6f08d0f7e43 -->

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas
for two common alchemical items to your formula book.
These new formulas can be for any level of item you can
create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it’s also
possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements
or from other alchemists, or to select the Inventor skill
feat so you can invent them (*Player Core 257*). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.419,r=0.903,b=0.525), with ID 1407d414-0280-4deb-a8a7-587f56d9c25d -->

As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when
Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don’t need to
learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the
1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create
a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of
life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites.
Items with type entries that have widely varied functions
require separate formulas, but most alchemical items
have a structure similar to elixir of life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.526,r=0.903,b=0.662), with ID 8f7b706f-b1ab-45d9-9ebb-7961dfaf372b -->

Advanced Alchemy  
During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist’s toolkit instead of an alchemist’s lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.676,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID 5d630499-07fc-4ee6-9fa4-3b2341386c9f -->

Versatile Vials  
You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.890,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 9838f959-20e7-4b20-b7c9-a0271bff9a24 -->

and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing
special reagents. During your daily preparations, you
can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your
Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum
number of vials. If you’re below your maximum number,
you can gather reagents from the environment around
you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration
mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn’t prevent you from
participating in other exploration activities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.079,r=0.473,b=0.220), with ID af2b89f0-29a4-4460-a45d-a3da3cb6450f -->

Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.219,r=0.473,b=0.326), with ID 7ce388e6-a384-43fa-8c02-58ec6ce1535c -->

You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist’s toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can’t be duplicated or preserved in any way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.326,r=0.473,b=0.390), with ID 8b642436-1a1f-442e-952f-cc173e05da18 -->

Quick Alchemy  
You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.397,r=0.473,b=0.452), with ID 7862f4e0-fb1b-4248-b4ca-d46e5e769803 -->

QUICK ALCHEMY

ALCHEMIST | MANIPULATE

Requirements You’re either holding or wearing an alchemist’s toolkit (Player Core 287) and you have a free hand.

You can either use up a versatile vial to make another alchemical consumable at a moment’s notice or create an especially short-lived versatile vial. Any effect created by an item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead.

• Create Consumable You expend one of your versatile vials to create a single alchemical consumable item of your level or lower that’s in your formula book. You don’t have to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn. (As normal, you need only one formula for an item to create any level of that item.)

• Quick Vial You create a versatile vial that can be used only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your research field (it can’t be used to create a consumable, for example). This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of your current turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.458,r=0.474,b=0.819), with ID 9b9c63aa-8cda-4403-933d-fe92eb3dd542 -->

**Field Vials** Your versatile vials can be used to heal a living creature a number of Hit Points equal to the vial’s initial damage. A creature can drink the vial for this benefit, or you can throw the vial at a willing creature within 20 feet as an Interact action to heal that creature. In either case, a vial used this way loses the acid and splash traits and gains the coagulant and healing traits, plus the elixir trait if a creature drinks it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.802,r=0.469,b=0.907), with ID 6c0b9be3-9ab4-4470-8396-bd19b8f80e2f -->

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many alchemist class features and abilities.

Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable (you can’t use additives with quick vials). You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.084,r=0.849,b=0.263), with ID 3a665960-7fe6-4b85-910d-43607df7bbd7 -->

**Coagulant:** Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time. If a creature heals Hit Points from an item with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those items). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.265,r=0.848,b=0.371), with ID 5ef890a9-bdbf-4160-ae46-e85cc8b8f5ec -->

**Infused:** An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.503,t=0.373,r=0.846,b=0.448), with ID 1b8ad38d-d74e-4a25-9938-3ea21247971c -->

trait that you have created, that creature gains a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0); these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.479,r=0.859,b=0.526), with ID 52cd9e31-9c91-4d29-9784-e0248fd61fa7 -->

**Advanced Vials (11th)** When you use a field vial to heal a creature that has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, the coagulant trait doesn't apply to that healing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.526,r=0.860,b=0.571), with ID 05928652-05b4-444b-b50c-a789a6f02dad -->

Greater Field Discovery (13th) When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature healed by the item regains the maximum Hit Points possible, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.572,r=0.861,b=0.632), with ID b3623118-a068-4052-92cb-bee4da36b735 -->

**Mutagenist**  
You focus on bizarre mutagenic transformations that sacrifice one aspect of a creature’s physical or psychological being in order to strengthen another. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.645,r=0.858,b=0.709), with ID 10765ba2-669d-4fc3-91d6-779a87a689d5 -->

Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical mutagens.
Field Benefit When you use a mutagen, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) plus half your level. These temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute or until the mutagen’s duration expires, whichever comes first. You can’t gain temporary HP from drinking a mutagen again for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.710,r=0.858,b=0.816), with ID b9a0b8dc-35fc-4775-9b0b-369a4df05eb8 -->

Field Vials You can drink the contents of one your versatile vials to suppress the drawback you take from one mutagen currently affecting you until the beginning of your next turn. A vial used this way loses the acid, bomb, and splash traits and gains the elixir trait. If you have more than one drawback due to Combine Elixirs or a similar ability, drinking the vial suppresses one drawback of your choice.

Toxicologist  
You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types.  
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical poisons.  
Field Benefit You can apply an injury poison you're holding to a weapon or piece of ammunition you're wielding as a single action, rather than as a 2-action activity. In addition, you flexibly mix acidic and poisonous alchemical compounds. Your infused poisons can affect creatures immune to poison. A creature takes acid damage instead of poison <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.797,r=0.514,b=0.941), with ID eb3be36e-d22d-4a45-8752-58fd4104e7e0 -->

damage from your infused poisons if either the creature is
immune to poison or that would be more detrimental to the
creature (as determined by the GM). Typically, this benefit

weakness to one of the damage types. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.478,r=0.905,b=0.555), with ID c140bd9e-2efb-4f3d-bad9-ef83be8e3bbe -->

Field Vials Your versatile vials have the poison trait and deal poison damage instead of having the acid trait and dealing acid damage (though your field benefit still applies). You can apply the contents of a versatile vial to a weapon or piece of ammunition as an injury poison. Add the versatile vial’s initial damage to the first successful Strike with that weapon or ammunition.

Greater Field Discovery (13th) When a creature fails its initial saving throw against an infused injury poison you created, the wound sprays poison onto another creature adjacent to it. The attacker who caused the injury chooses which creature, if there’s more than one, and can choose to forgo this effect. That creature is exposed to the poison. The second creature doesn’t spread the poison further. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.786,r=0.903,b=0.893), with ID ed3a455d-7b6a-4458-b58e-cdce7436ceef -->

ALCHEMICAL FAMILIAR                                            FEAT 1

ALCHEMIST
You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. You gain a familiar, which has the construct familiar ability (Player Core 212); this is permanent, doesn’t require the familiar to have the tough familiar ability, and doesn’t count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2). The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.150,r=0.471,b=0.312), with ID 2df192b9-6ffd-42c2-bc00-fb1b34008299 -->

ALCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT                FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, rather than spending 10 minutes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.321,r=0.471,b=0.434), with ID 0a19a774-2a4c-41d5-adf1-051ec46cea8b -->

BLOWGUN POISONER                                    FEAT 1
  ALCHEMIST
You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your blowgun Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature’s resistance. If you critically succeed at a blowgun Strike using a poisoned dart, the target’s initial save against the poison is one degree of success worse than the creature rolls; this is a misfortune effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.443,r=0.471,b=0.585), with ID 6ecd7031-aa4f-4a67-9c79-9bd2c72ae6f8 -->

In addition, if you make a blowgun Strike while hidden or undetected, you don’t automatically become observed. Instead, immediately attempt a Stealth check against the Perception DC of the target. If you succeed, you don’t become observed, and are hidden (if you were undetected, you still become hidden rather than remaining undetected). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.586,r=0.470,b=0.680), with ID c3d78e00-b313-4e0c-88b6-f4647966b18a -->

ALCHEMIST
You keep your bombs and bomb-related reagents in easy-to-
reach pouches from which you draw without thinking. You
Interact to draw a bomb, draw a versatile vial, or use Quick
Alchemy to create a bomb, then Strike with the bomb. If you
have the ability to create more than one bomb at a time with
Quick Alchemy (such as from the double brew class feature),
you can Strike with only one of the bombs you create with
this action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.781,r=0.470,b=0.939), with ID 0f5e3c68-2218-4a0e-a269-490c0dfeddf9 -->

SAMPLE FORMULA BOOK
You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas. A beginner’s book with these formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling alchemists away from more innovative experiments.

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration depicting a short, armored figure holding a large crossbow, with a white mouse perched on their shoulder and numerous potion vials attached to their bandolier and belt.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a short, stocky humanoid character, likely a dwarf or gnome, dressed in ornate armor and clothing with purple and brown tones.
  • The character is holding a large, decorated crossbow diagonally across their body.
  • A white mouse with a long pink tail is perched on the character's left shoulder.
  • Multiple potion vials of various colors (blue, pink, green) are attached to the character's bandolier and belt.
  • The character has curly, dark hair and a full beard.
  • The background is a plain, parchment-like color, with a thin border framing the image.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses a soft, painterly style with detailed shading and highlights.
  • No visible text or UI elements are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is centered in the frame, standing with feet apart.
  • The crossbow is held in both hands, angled from lower left to upper right.
  • The mouse is positioned on the left shoulder, facing forward.
  • Potion vials are distributed across the chest, belt, and bandolier, with some hanging at the character's side.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a fantasy adventurer archetype, emphasizing preparedness (potions), ranged combat (crossbow), and companionship (mouse familiar).
  • The composition draws attention to the character's equipment and readiness for adventure, with a whimsical touch provided by the mouse. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.554,r=0.517,b=0.969), with ID f3ef786a-0737-4c6e-a87b-1aff76e1a7c5 -->

You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make it emit smoke. When thrown, in addition to its normal effects, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot burst. You choose which corner of the target’s space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.258,r=0.907,b=0.419), with ID a20f5537-9d55-4ce8-a31d-1b6cd0b93c7e -->

In addition, when you Craft alchemical consumables during downtime, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This doesn’t change the amount of alchemical reagents or other ingredients required to craft each item, nor does it change your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.571,r=0.905,b=0.695), with ID efc84177-efe3-4327-a2fc-546b06bee181 -->

Summary : This is a dynamic fantasy illustration showing a goblin-like creature gleefully running across a burning ship, holding a pink potion, while a rat-like humanoid in the background throws a lit bomb. The scene is chaotic, with fire and destruction dominating the composition.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a green goblin-like creature with exaggerated features, wearing goggles, a necklace with a skull, and a utility belt with vials and pouches.
  • The goblin is in the foreground, running barefoot with a wide, mischievous grin, holding a round-bottom flask filled with a swirling pink liquid.
  • In the background, a large rat-like humanoid with sharp teeth and claws is hurling a lit bomb, adding to the chaos.
  • The setting is a wooden ship engulfed in bright orange flames, with debris and smoke filling the scene.
  • The perspective is low and dynamic, emphasizing the goblin’s movement and the scale of destruction.
  • The color palette is dominated by fiery oranges and yellows from the flames, contrasted with the green and pink hues of the goblin and potion.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • Artist’s signature “FML” visible on the left side.
  • No on-image text or UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The goblin is in the extreme foreground, left side, with one foot closest to the viewer, creating a sense of depth.
  • The rat-like creature is in the mid-background, right side, partially obscured by flames.
  • The burning ship and fire occupy the central and right portions, with the bomb and potion drawing the eye diagonally across the image.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of chaos, danger, and mischievous glee, with the goblin’s expression and posture suggesting reckless abandon.
  • The composition uses strong diagonal lines (deck planks, fire, thrown bomb) to enhance the feeling of motion and destruction.
  • The contrast between the goblin’s bright, detailed foreground and the fiery, chaotic background draws attention to the character’s actions and the overall mayhem. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.002,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.521), with ID 144c4b82-a81d-4dac-9455-133c5641912d -->

ADDITIVE  ALCHEMIST
You can mix an aromatic salve into an elixir with the healing trait to soothe physical maladies. In addition to its normal effects, the elixir can be imbibed by a creature prevented from doing so (such as a sickened creature). In addition to its other effects, the elixir attempts to counteract an effect imposing one of the following conditions of the imbiber’s choice: clumsy, enfeebled, sickened, or stupefied. Use half your level rounded up for the counteract rank and your class DC – 10 for the counteract modifier. The imbiber is then temporarily immune to the effects of this additive for 10 minutes. The additive can’t counteract curses, diseases, or conditions that are part of the creature’s normal state. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.626,r=0.471,b=0.847), with ID bbeb6796-1fbb-48fd-8d01-d4a396895509 -->

You can add the full ingredients of a second elixir to an elixir you make to create a hybrid concoction. You must expend an additional versatile vial to make this combined elixir, and the ingredients must be for an elixir you could create with Quick Alchemy. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect.

DEBILITATING BOMB                                                    FEAT 6
ADDITIVE   ALCHEMIST
You can add a crystalline additive to an alchemical bomb to have it undermine your enemy. Choose dazzled, deafened, off-guard, or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with the bomb hits, in addition to the bomb’s normal effects, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw, even if someone else throws the bomb. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.907,b=0.222), with ID 20823060-bc7b-4bc8-a10a-083d03115da3 -->

DIRECTIONAL BOMBS                                    FEAT 6

ALCHEMIST
You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone that sprays in a single direction, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can create a splash in a 15-foot cone. You choose the cone’s direction, but its first square must be a square in the target’s space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.228,r=0.907,b=0.371), with ID ee1fe0aa-8211-4d2a-bee6-a9a3bb1dac0f -->

Special If you have the Expanded Splash feat or another ability that increases the radius of splash damage, you can have the splash damage be a 20-foot cone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.371,r=0.905,b=0.420), with ID 361849d0-3421-43cb-befd-a0253e0b7bc1 -->

FORTIFIED ELIXIRS                                            FEAT 6

ALCHEMIST

Your treatments for diseases and poisons can be very efficacious, though they tend not to last as long. A creature that is under the effect of an infused antidote or antiplague that you created can choose to reroll a failed Fortitude saving throw against an appropriate affliction (poison for antidote and disease for antiplague). The creature doesn’t gain the elixir’s usual item bonus to the reroll, and after the reroll, the elixir’s duration immediately ends. This is a fortune effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.427,r=0.907,b=0.587), with ID ccaa7e4f-cb10-4d2d-a99b-d0c61cb3741c -->

ALCHEMIST

A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.597,r=0.906,b=0.772), with ID af4d9eac-fdab-45c1-838a-a21fc09e0de7 -->

# MUTANT PHYSIQUE

FEAT 8

ALCHEMIST

Basic mutagens that affect your physical form can bring out the beast within you, turn you nigh invincible, or make your body more elastic. While you’re affected by one of the listed mutagens, you get an additional benefit.

- • Bestial Mutagen You gain the mutagen’s item bonus to your Intimidation checks. In addition, you increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step, and they gain the deadly d10 trait.
- • Juggernaut Mutagen You gain resistance to all physical damage equal to half your level.
- • Quicksilver Mutagen You can stretch your legs and Step up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect from Squeezing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.381,r=0.472,b=0.646), with ID ab096ee3-19d3-4897-bb10-1bc0d1ca1101 -->

Special If you can be under the effects of multiple mutagens (with the mutagenist greater field discovery, for example), you get all relevant benefits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.647,r=0.470,b=0.696), with ID cff8e7c1-0ace-4241-a3fa-e4adcdf2e4c3 -->

PINPOINT POISONER                FEAT 8

ALCHEMIST

Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully Strike an off-guard creature with a poisoned weapon or expose an off-guard creature to an inhaled poison, that creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.703,r=0.470,b=0.817), with ID d7d1206a-a361-43e4-82b6-03496f5b4e3b -->

STICKY BOMB                                            FEAT 8
ADDITIVE   ALCHEMIST
You can mix in a sticky additive to an alchemical bomb to make its contents adhere and continue to deal damage. A creature hit by a sticky bomb also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb’s splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.826,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID 17148c03-25e5-4a1c-8690-646973d064a4 -->

10TH LEVEL

ADVANCED EFFICIENT ALCHEMY FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Efficient Alchemy
You make an even-larger batch of alchemical items each morning. Increase the maximum number of items you can create with advanced alchemy to 8 + your Intelligence modifier, or to 10 + your Intelligence modifier if you’re 16th level or higher. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.072,r=0.861,b=0.220), with ID 5b2429ef-69f8-443d-82b2-130ea506d99b -->

EXPANDED SPLASH                FEAT 10

ALCHEMIST
You can throw bombs at just the right trajectory to create especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an alchemical bomb and that bomb has the splash trait, you can have the splash damage affect all creatures within 10 feet of the target instead of 5 feet. If you do, you gain a status bonus to the bomb’s splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If you have the bomber 5th-level field discovery, this additional damage applies even if you caused your bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier instead of the normal amount, allowing your bombs to deal splash damage equal to double your Intelligence modifier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.229,r=0.862,b=0.435), with ID 461d6662-4283-4340-9c79-ab7cc6d12134 -->

GREATER DEBILITATING BOMB                FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Debilitating Bomb
You have learned enhanced techniques and alchemical secrets that allow you to expand the range of effects you can impose with your bombs. When you use Debilitating Bomb, add the following to the list you can choose from: clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, stupefied 1, or –10-foot status penalty to Speeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.443,r=0.861,b=0.573), with ID 1fdfe37b-31fc-4490-bc18-fd4cd32ab232 -->

UNSTABLE CONCOCTION FEAT 10  
ADDITIVE  ALCHEMIST  
You can mix a wondrous yet volatile liquid into an alchemical consumable if it has an initial effect that uses dice. You increase the size of any dice for the item’s initial effect by one step. For instance, you could increase damage from a moderate alchemist’s fire to 2d10 or healing from a moderate elixir of life to 5d8+12. Because this affects only initial dice, it wouldn’t increase unarmed attack damage from a bestial mutagen, persistent damage from an acid flask, and the like. When this item is activated, the creature activating it must succeed at a DC 10 flat check or take acid damage equal to the item’s level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.581,r=0.862,b=0.771), with ID 049e1795-9d9b-408d-86e7-e30e350f3f8b -->

EXTEND ELIXIR                                            FEAT 12

ALCHEMIST
Integrating your own personal energy into the elixirs you create causes them to affect you for longer. When you consume one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or longer, that elixir’s duration is doubled. If you created the item with Quick Alchemy, this can’t cause it to exceed the 10-minute duration limit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.811,r=0.860,b=0.939), with ID a80962a5-069b-4ab2-97ae-a51a854e030f -->

SUPREME INVIGORATING ELIXIR                FEAT 12

ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Invigorating Elixir
For the purposes of counteracting effects with invigorating elixirs, treat your level as though it were 2 higher. Add the listed conditions to those you can choose for an invigorating elixir you create to counteract: petrified, stunned. You can also choose a disease regardless of what, if any, conditions it imposes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.908,b=0.206), with ID 6ed83cc9-6828-4cc6-aebd-c434f8665fd0 -->

UNCANNY BOMBS                                            FEAT 12

ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Far Lobber
You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance. When you throw an alchemical item with the bomb trait, its range increment increases to 60 feet, you reduce any circumstance bonus to the target’s AC from cover by 1, and you automatically succeed at the flat check when targeting a concealed creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.212,r=0.908,b=0.344), with ID 4a92fbb6-2d66-494c-8af6-9be7e904d582 -->

DOUBLE POISON                                            FEAT 14

ALCHEMIST
You can apply two different infused injury poisons to the same weapon, though not to a piece of ammunition. Each poison’s level must be 2 or more levels lower than your level. You have to apply the two poisons individually. Once you’ve applied both, the poisons merge into a double poison that uses the lower of the two poisons’ DCs and number of stages. This double poison is virulent only if both poisons were virulent. Combine the effects of each stage of the poison on any creature affected by it. For each stage of the poison, use the effects of both poisons and the longer interval for that stage among the two poisons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.381,r=0.907,b=0.574), with ID 1a30711c-c102-485c-9416-6b38955bef8e -->

MUTANT INNERVATION

FEAT 14

ALCHEMIST

Basic mutagens that affect your mind and thoughts can make you communicate telepathically, protect you from being detected, or let you communicate with anyone. While you’re affected by one of the listed mutagens, you get an additional benefit.

- • Cognitive Mutagen You also gain the mutagen’s item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, and Survival checks. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 60 feet with whom you share a language. The communication is two-way once you establish it, so a creature you contact can also communicate with you.
- • Serene Mutagen Detection, revelation, and scrying effects of 9th rank (or 17th level) or lower detect nothing from you or your possessions and auras. For instance, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on you.
- • Silvertongue Mutagen Ignore circumstance penalties you would take to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks. In addition, your words transcend linguistic barriers; everyone listening to you speak hears your words as if you were speaking in their own language. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.580,r=0.910,b=0.944), with ID 4d18161b-7950-4784-8543-0b5c2eb70dd9 -->

TRUE DEBILITATING BOMB                FEAT 14
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Greater Debilitating Bomb
You have discovered increasingly devastating ways for your bombs to impede your foes. When you use Debilitating Bomb, add the following to the list of effects you can choose from: enfeebled 2, stupefied 2, or a –15-foot status penalty to Speeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.165,r=0.473,b=0.283), with ID 3ff706c9-e60c-434e-8d9a-28df85c15649 -->

ETERNAL ELIXIR                                            FEAT 16
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Extend Elixir
Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or more, you can make the elixir's duration indefinite. You can do so only if the elixir's level is half your level or lower. If you later consume a different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the previous indefinite elixir ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.319,r=0.473,b=0.482), with ID 7e928ffe-43b6-4403-b914-597d27e9a3b5 -->

EXPLOITIVE BOMB                FEAT 16
ADDITIVE   ALCHEMIST
You can mix a refractile substance into an alchemical bomb to foil resistances. Choose one damage type the bomb can deal. Any damage dealt by the bomb—including initial, splash, and persistent damage—ignores an amount of that resistance equal to your level. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.486,r=0.473,b=0.604), with ID 122543c4-31b2-47d7-8d65-b74b40e126a7 -->

PERSISTENT MUTAGEN                FEAT 16

ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Extend Elixir
You’ve trained your physical form to remain stable. Once per day, when you consume an alchemical item with the infused and mutagen traits, you can extend its duration to last until the next time you make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration. Unlike with the normal extension from Extend Elixir, this can exceed the duration of an item created with Quick Alchemy beyond its normal 10-minute limit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.609,r=0.474,b=0.774), with ID 60c70823-1fa3-4e75-8651-61256c4fadda -->

18TH LEVEL

IMPROBABLE ELIXIRS FEAT 18

ALCHEMIST
Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate effects most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); these potions must be of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical consumables with the elixir trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.775,r=0.472,b=0.942), with ID 667623f6-933a-4ae2-9c8a-590a33844bf1 -->

alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components,
and you can use an alchemist’s toolkit (for Quick Alchemy) or
an alchemist’s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other
required toolkits. Other than that, the formula doesn’t change.
Once you’ve chosen the potion formulas, they can’t be changed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.077,r=0.863,b=0.161), with ID 0889145a-51e5-4d39-bbd3-7f73ac55d410 -->

MIRACLE WORKER                                    FEAT 18
  ALCHEMIST
Frequency once every 10 minutes
Your alchemical mastery can resuscitate the recently slain. You can administer a major or true elixir of life to a creature who has been dead for no more than 2 rounds. When you do, that creature is immediately returned to life with 1 Hit Point and becomes wounded 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.165,r=0.864,b=0.297), with ID 61c5cf4c-e44a-4cdc-9f3a-2427b448fd63 -->

PERFECT DEBILITATION                                    FEAT 18
  ALCHEMIST
You have perfected the formulas for bombs that impede your
enemies. When you use Debilitating Bomb, your target avoids
the condition the bomb imposes only if it critically succeeds at
its saving throw. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.303,r=0.865,b=0.405), with ID 09d5385d-8d7f-4ce3-8b0b-c531e0418337 -->

20TH LEVEL

ALCHEMICAL REVIVIFICATION        FEAT 20
ALCHEMIST
If you die while under the effect of at least one elixir, the alchemical compounds in your bloodstream bring you back to life at the start of your next turn. You're affected by an elixir of rejuvenation (page 288), then a true elixir of life, then your choice of a major bestial mutagen, major juggernaut mutagen, or major quicksilver mutagen as though you just imbibed it. These automatic reactions don't get any special benefits you add when creating or using these items. Because you died, all other alchemical compounds in your bloodstream are inert. After being revived, you're temporarily immune to Alchemical Rejuvenation for 1d4 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.407,r=0.865,b=0.651), with ID 26535f3e-26a4-410c-acd5-efdb90181cee -->

CRAFT PHILOSOPHER'S STONE                FEAT 20

ALCHEMIST
Your research has paid off, culminating in the legendary philosopher’s stone. You learn the formula for the philosopher’s stone (page 295) and can add it to your formula book. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.656,r=0.865,b=0.743), with ID 7e005dcc-e9c9-4ad0-b1b5-62d606f23b2d -->

MEGA BOMB                                                                 FEAT 20
ADDITIVE   ALCHEMIST   MANIPULATE
You can add a highly explosive additive to an alchemical
bomb to turn it into a mega bomb. Throwing this bomb takes
a 2-action activity instead of a Strike. This isn’t a Strike, and
you don’t make an attack roll. The mega bomb explodes in
a 30-foot burst within 60 feet. It deals damage as if each
creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On
a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect
a primary target (such as off-guard from bottled lightning).
Though all targets in the area take splash damage as primary
targets, there is no further splash beyond that area. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.748,r=0.865,b=0.943), with ID 3ee703d5-8548-4fa6-886a-196efe1c7e38 -->

# BARBARIAN

*Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.065,r=0.866,b=0.226), with ID 3fb0b430-3989-4dd7-8f5a-182341b03c4d -->

KEY ATTRIBUTE
Strength
At 1st level, your class gives you
an attribute boost to Strength. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.254,r=0.323,b=0.342), with ID 2a7b9263-882e-4a6d-8513-010b26d112e5 -->

HIT POINTS
12 plus your Constitution Modifier
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.343,t=0.255,r=0.587,b=0.347), with ID 4c0e522b-b3a2-40a0-a11e-8db5b09446a4 -->

**During combat encounters...**
You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.366,r=0.602,b=0.436), with ID 8ac816ae-a031-4e93-9bbd-5cbacb1eb562 -->

**During social encounters...**
You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can’t get the job done. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.444,r=0.601,b=0.496), with ID 9160e566-67e1-40d6-bbe6-33eb7a2c8e1c -->

While exploring...
You look out for danger, ready to charge headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.504,r=0.602,b=0.588), with ID 3417c989-8e7f-47f3-bba5-49057ce8af78 -->

In downtime...
You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.597,r=0.600,b=0.650), with ID 95149eb2-7c2e-42c8-9165-110b7b22c481 -->

- **You might...**
- Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
- Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
- Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.658,r=0.601,b=0.726), with ID fa087c5e-58a4-483e-a09b-e201a73fc83a -->

- Others probably...
  - Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight.
  - See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
  - Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.735,r=0.601,b=0.833), with ID 770270fe-0eb6-4acb-bc31-2b41d64cc09d -->

## Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.644,r=0.513,b=0.710), with ID ade52ffb-f342-4d54-a9c8-967c0460615d -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get
four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an
attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two
boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must
boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it
by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.771,r=0.513,b=0.862), with ID 04e4984b-ab71-403a-81c4-9404a474449e -->

RAGE

BARBARIAN | CONCENTRATE | EMOTION | MENTAL

Requirements You aren’t fatigued or raging.
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. While you are raging:
• You deal 2 additional damage on melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
• You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.124,r=0.904,b=0.294), with ID e600f44c-461f-448d-8131-3747afa16545 -->

Rage lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. When you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and can't gain temporary Hit Points from using the Rage action again for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.294,r=0.903,b=0.388), with ID 58698318-dd3e-407a-8993-105699884cb4 -->

Quick-Tempered  
You gain the Quick-Tempered free action, which lets you Rage at the slightest provocation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.399,r=0.902,b=0.450), with ID 4833f946-d5f4-4600-afd6-32833e0c6489 -->

QUICK-TEMPERED ◇
BARBARIAN
Trigger You roll initiative.
Requirements You are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor.
So long as you are able to move freely, your fury is instinctive and instantaneous. You Rage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.459,r=0.903,b=0.571), with ID ad3cdb9f-3c52-4dc0-b905-dfc030ad7619 -->

Instinct
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct. For more information, see Instincts on page 74. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.583,r=0.903,b=0.709), with ID 812bdf49-591c-40e3-baae-891a995376b9 -->

skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be
trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a
skill feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.782,r=0.903,b=0.861), with ID 1ad4f434-9861-43f2-9194-359c11a6e8c7 -->

Furious Footfalls                3rd
The urge to fight drives you ever forward. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed. This bonus increases to +10 feet while you’re raging. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.874,r=0.904,b=0.939), with ID 20513464-ad1d-4fab-a4ca-35a3365a48c1 -->

INSTINCTS
You channel your rage through an instinct. You decide what your instinct means to you. It could be a creature or symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage, or state of mind. Each instinct includes the following. Your choice of instinct also serves as a prerequisite for many feats.
Instinct Ability You gain this fundamental ability related to your instinct. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.517,b=0.217), with ID 39491120-c133-4483-86a4-65184affe5c9 -->

Animal Instinct  
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage, granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf or another werecreature. Select an animal from the Animal Instincts table that best matches your chosen animal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.234), with ID b4e47ead-4e5f-41eb-920d-0b8347e4181c -->

Instinct Ability—Bestial Rage While raging, you gain your chosen animal’s unarmed attack (or attacks), but you’re unable to use weapons. The specific attack gained, the damage it deals, and its traits are listed in the Animal Instincts table. These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action gains the morph and primal traits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.234,r=0.904,b=0.325), with ID 4fb5076d-b374-468c-a9f9-f32c9ccf35c4 -->

Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage die size for the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks. If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.326,r=0.904,b=0.432), with ID aa8992f9-3d74-4336-a155-b1cfbcb39171 -->

Dragon Instinct  
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic majesty, or you gained insights by drinking or bathing in dragon’s blood or watching a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select a type of dragon from the Dragon Instincts table as your instinct’s dragon type. These are the dragons from Monster Core, but your GM might allow you to choose dragons from other sources and determine their tradition and dragon breath type. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.554,t=0.690,r=0.905,b=0.877), with ID bb8d069d-85d8-4a94-a501-2957cc7c2136 -->

Fury Instinct  
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well within you. You use your rage as you choose.  
Instinct Ability—Unstoppable Frenzy Increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3. You gain a bonus 1st-level barbarian feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.429,r=0.471,b=0.524), with ID fc8a1e1b-ad7a-4fda-89d4-45241f9d0de5 -->

Giant Instinct  
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant. This doesn’t necessarily mean you revere giants—you might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.643,r=0.470,b=0.754), with ID e6483408-3020-452f-ba69-f7aa75ac6623 -->

Instinct Ability—Titan Mauler You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you’re not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. You start with one such weapon, which you receive for free. It must be a common melee or ranged weapon, it must have a Price of 9 gp or less (not including the Price adjustment for being a larger weapon), and it must be common or you must otherwise have access to it. It is your personal weapon and has no value if sold unless you later add runes to it, and it has the normal Bulk for a weapon of its size (Player Core 270). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.754,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 75b05e7d-b85c-43ee-bd71-3f6a658efa77 -->

## KEY TERMS

You’ll see the following key terms in many barbarian class features.

**Flourish:** Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.

**Rage:** You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.073,r=0.861,b=0.249), with ID f3af26e4-ef38-4dac-b8bd-995d25bfb5d4 -->

When wielding a larger weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon’s unwieldy size. You can’t remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.
**Specialization Ability (7th)** Increase the damage from Rage when using a larger weapon from 6 to 10; if you have greater weapon specialization, increase it from 10 to 18.
**Raging Resistance (9th)** You resist bludgeoning damage and your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain raging resistance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.262,r=0.863,b=0.434), with ID 6287a4e3-37bb-409f-a590-00ed3dc4b47b -->

Spirit Instinct  
Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits around you; worship ancestors or apparitions; or are haunted by the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or foe, your rage takes the form of a spiritual possession.  
Instinct Ability—Spirit Rage While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3 and change its damage type to spirit, instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If you choose to deal spirit damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and spirit traits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.444,r=0.862,b=0.647), with ID 10514988-82f6-4b8f-8379-3c15ebee6ff9 -->

Superstition Instinct  
A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and counter the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether you’re a member of a superstitious family or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.767,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 6f8e158b-6327-4d3a-8596-1d0329ad2d79 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a dramatic battle scene between a giant, blue-skinned warrior and a much smaller, airborne human fighter in a snowy mountain landscape.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are a towering, blue-skinned giant with a horned helmet, fur cloak, and large axe, and a human warrior leaping through the air with a sword drawn.
  • The setting is a rugged, snow-covered mountain pass with jagged rocks and swirling snow.
  • The perspective is dynamic, with the giant in the foreground and the human mid-leap from a rock, suggesting imminent combat.
  • The colour palette is dominated by cold greys, whites, and blues, with some muted browns and golds in the characters’ clothing and weapons.
  • Lighting is diffuse, consistent with an overcast, wintry environment.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible textures in fur, metal, and snow.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The giant occupies the right foreground, facing left, with his axe raised defensively.
  • The human is airborne, leaping from a snow-covered rock on the left toward the giant, suggesting an attack.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the giant’s face and the airborne human near intersecting points, drawing the viewer’s eye to the action.
  • The background consists of steep, snow-laden cliffs, enhancing the sense of scale and danger.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of scale disparity and tension, emphasizing the epic nature of the confrontation.
  • The dynamic poses and flying snow suggest imminent impact and high energy.
  • The cold, harsh environment reinforces the perilous and fantastical setting of the scene. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.059,r=0.877,b=0.523), with ID d36ec3d5-cf23-4329-943e-788e035bbe3a -->

SPIRIT’S WRATH ◆

FEAT 12

ATTACK  BARBARIAN  CONCENTRATE  RAGE

Prerequisites spirit instinct

You call forth an ephemeral spirit, typically the apparition of an ancestor or a nature spirit, which takes the form of a wisp. The wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed attack against an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp’s attack modifier is equal to your proficiency bonus for martial weapons plus your Strength modifier plus a +2 item bonus, and it applies the same circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that you have. On a hit, the wisp deals spirit damage equal to 4d8 plus your Constitution modifier. Don’t apply your Rage damage or your weapon specialization damage, but circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that would also affect the wisp’s damage apply. On a critical hit, the wisp deals double damage and the target becomes frightened 1. This attack uses and counts toward your multiple attack penalty as if you were the one attacking. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.071,r=0.472,b=0.358), with ID bd3f869d-240f-4b94-8e67-3b48b746ef9e -->

You draw upon your superstitious fury to destroy a spell. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack against a creature, object, or a spell manifestation (such as the wall created by wall of fire or the guardian from spiritual guardian). If you’re targeting something that doesn’t have an AC listed, its AC against this Strike is usually 10 for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM. If your Strike hits, you can attempt to counteract a single spell or magical effect on the target. Your counteract rank for this attempt is equal to half your level rounded up, and you use the result of your attack roll for the counteract check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.366,r=0.472,b=0.601), with ID 117864a7-d310-4a17-a3d9-8deb61937664 -->

BARBARIAN   FLOURISH   RAGE
Requirements You are wielding a ranged or thrown weapon that deals piercing damage.

Your projectiles are unhindered by flesh and bone. Make a ranged Strike with a ranged or thrown weapon that deals piercing damage against each creature in a 30-foot line (this uses only one projectile despite the number of Strikes). These Strikes ignore all cover granted by creatures. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.166,r=0.473,b=0.359), with ID 89081936-5ca7-46d7-a6b3-38f4c4194888 -->

You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible benefits. You can ignore the requirements of Share Rage, using it multiple times in a Rage. Allies affected by Share Rage can choose to gain your instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization. They must abide by any restrictions of your instinct if they do so (such as the anathema of the superstition instinct). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.486,r=0.866,b=0.665), with ID 109c83d0-0ce9-412a-96c8-51efee226eac -->

Ancestry and Background

Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.751,r=0.512,b=0.801), with ID 61f91f47-5bc0-4621-ad50-25d0a7834dfe -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.801,r=0.512,b=0.878), with ID b8f2a501-7276-4bc6-8971-db5a59e4ddf7 -->

**Initial Proficiencies**  
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.889,r=0.513,b=0.941), with ID 067d0282-11d4-4b9d-b32b-56bb6d3568f7 -->

Deity  
As a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.077,r=0.904,b=0.174), with ID 5781c5e6-24b0-415e-a2df-bc6c992a591b -->

Skill
You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity.
As normal, if you’re already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.185,r=0.904,b=0.250), with ID b8e05182-6dba-479e-b704-ba4a51915bc2 -->

Anathema  
Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.263,r=0.903,b=0.371), with ID b0ac5709-2a50-4f6e-95e3-6cbb1af72bca -->

Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals
are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells,
committing acts, and using items that are anathema to
your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.373,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID f29ae08b-f9c6-4b56-b4fe-ded7dffeac63 -->

Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema
to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your
connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a
ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma,
the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema
don’t appear in any deity’s formal list. For borderline cases,
you and your GM determine which acts are anathema. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.435,r=0.903,b=0.540), with ID 5536406f-6029-43c0-b81d-2f5f9f51fc50 -->

If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual (Player Core 390). If your deity doesn’t require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause (page 89) while still following the same deity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.542,r=0.903,b=0.693), with ID aac785d1-63e4-4e57-bae9-a6812c139102 -->

Sanctification  
Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.706,r=0.902,b=0.785), with ID e39ae053-39ec-4aff-b0f8-4c43a0463285 -->

If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity’s
sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must
be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the
deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don’t
require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy
and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the
previous trait until you atone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.787,r=0.903,b=0.892), with ID 0551f8b0-c905-4cca-9187-99215cc26caa -->

Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely
disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character
option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.894,r=0.902,b=0.939), with ID 69624851-64da-49da-9ba0-f984ecb8001f -->

Holy: You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them” and the anathema “Commit murder.” Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline (Player Core 397), the acts listed there are anathema to you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.111,r=0.471,b=0.218), with ID ec29c628-c22c-4548-bc5e-b2dc4606b359 -->

Unholy: You gain the unholy trait and add that trait
to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not put
another’s needs before your own or those of your deity”
and the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such
as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone’s
needs before those of your deity.” None of these prevents
you from performing acts others might consider helpful,
but these acts must be done with the expectation that they
ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.219,r=0.471,b=0.358), with ID bc0108f8-b1c9-46f9-9085-259b8be332f0 -->

Deific Weapon  
You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain access to it, and if it’s an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.368,r=0.471,b=0.481), with ID 70de0355-720e-4484-baec-da8ebb86f596 -->

Champion’s Aura  
You’re surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you’re a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion’s reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.490,r=0.471,b=0.619), with ID 74dc4df9-e6a0-436f-8363-1d9f922414e8 -->

Cause
You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name. Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction. The following champion causes are on pages 91–93.
   Desecration (Unholy): You selfishly corrupt and destroy.
   Grandeur (Holy): You exemplify the glory and splendor of the celestial realms.
   Iniquity (Unholy): You destroy, take advantage, and act with dishonor.
   Justice: You follow laws and mete out just punishment.
   Liberation: You oppose tyranny and fight for freedom.
   Obedience: You enforce hierarchies and order.
   Redemption (Holy): You try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.629,r=0.470,b=0.876), with ID e04d2abb-df61-4e63-ba16-e484208422ef -->

It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.143,r=0.860,b=0.234), with ID f98a866c-a2c0-435c-881e-446ab7c21c8e -->

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells.

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a heavily armored female warrior, equipped with a sword, shield, and bow, standing in a heroic pose.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a female warrior in ornate, silver and gold plate armor with red accents and a flowing red cape.
  • She holds a large sword in her right hand and a white shield in her left, which is emblazoned with a red symbol of a sword surrounded by radiant lines.
  • A quiver of arrows and a bow are visible on her back, indicating she is also an archer.
  • The perspective is frontal, showing the full figure from head to toe.
  • The color palette is dominated by metallic silvers, golds, reds, and whites, giving a regal and heroic impression.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The armor is highly detailed with intricate patterns, gold filigree, and layered plating.
  • The shield’s symbol is a stylized sword with radiating lines, possibly signifying light or divine power.
  • The character’s attire includes a white skirt beneath the armor, leather straps, and various pouches and accessories.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The warrior is centered in the composition, occupying the majority of the frame.
  • The sword is held downward and slightly to the left, while the shield is held forward and to the right.
  • The red cape flows behind, adding a sense of movement and drama.
  • The background is plain, focusing attention entirely on the character.

Analysis :

  • The combination of weapons (sword, shield, bow, arrows) suggests versatility in combat.
  • The use of red and gold highlights, along with the radiant motif, may indicate affiliation with a holy or knightly order. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.319,r=0.540,b=0.955), with ID ff83aa4c-c616-4d23-bba3-b6ae45bd9a09 -->

On the Case  
As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases  
waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one  
reaction you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead  
and Clue In. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.214,r=0.904,b=0.295), with ID c0e6727a-eebc-4993-b4e4-58515f144169 -->

PURSUE A LEAD

CONCENTRATE  EXPLORATION  INVESTIGATOR

You name one detail you’ve identified that you think is part of a larger mystery, then spend 1 minute examining it. The detail is typically either obvious or something you’ve already discovered using Recall Knowledge, Sense Motive, Gather Information, or a similar action. After the minute passes, the GM either confirms there’s a larger mystery or tells you there’s nothing more to learn (the detail is inconsequential or you know all the information already). If there is in fact a larger mystery at play, you can’t Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, but you can choose to open an investigation. To do so, define the question at the heart of the mystery, such as “Where has the priceless work of art that was supposed to hang here been taken?” or “Who or what killed this priest?” Work with your GM to refine the question if need be. You can also give your investigation a name to better keep track of it (such as “The Case of the Cheated Goblin” or “The Skinsaw Murders”). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.307,r=0.904,b=0.585), with ID 3e3e7929-22dd-4bbe-80d1-082ed226b9c3 -->

**Investigation Bonus** Whenever you attempt a Perception check or skill check to attempt to get closer to answering the question at the heart of an active investigation, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.587,r=0.904,b=0.708), with ID 1901e433-2678-4519-9310-51a2dddcf74c -->

Active Investigations You can maintain two active investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after that, the case must be different from any of your current investigations (as far as you are aware), and you give up on a current investigation of your choice. Once you’ve given up pursuit of an investigation, you can’t Pursue a Lead into it again until after the next time you make your daily preparations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.710,r=0.903,b=0.815), with ID 57c6138a-9c91-4712-a8c1-34e1c45e45fd -->

**Solving an Investigation** If you answer the question at the heart of your investigation, the GM tells you that you’ve done so. You don’t lose the bonus or other benefits until you choose to close the investigation by Pursuing a Lead again or voluntarily Dismissing it. If what you discover points to an even larger mystery, you can work with the GM to adapt the question and name of the investigation to the new information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.817,r=0.903,b=0.938), with ID a82ba9e5-0624-4b72-ae56-efe62c304749 -->

DEVISE A STRATAGEM ◆ OR ◇

CONCENTRATE  FORTUNE  INVESTIGATOR

Frequency once per round
You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to formulate a plan of attack. Choose a creature you can see. You can Devise a Stratagem as a free action if you’re aware that creature could help answer the question at the heart of one of your active investigations. Roll a d20, then decide on an attack stratagem or skill stratagem. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.336,r=0.472,b=0.479), with ID a59d6d40-78d6-47ef-9a54-597b8a597ce9 -->

Attack Stratagem If you Strike the chosen creature before the start of your next turn, you must use the result of the d20 roll for your Strike’s attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the first Strike you make against the creature this round, not any subsequent ones. When you make this substitution, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it’s a melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.479,r=0.473,b=0.647), with ID ece4f52f-f049-4aa6-986c-16db5122c229 -->

Skill Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target until the start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill check or Perception check involving the target before the start of your next turn. If you would gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to such a check, that bonus increases by 1 instead of you gaining the +1 bonus listed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.648,r=0.473,b=0.757), with ID 24a1e047-195d-4fec-a5a3-7a90a9c79a06 -->

**Methodology**  
Your studies have made you savvy in a broad spectrum of areas, but one particular investigative process drew your intense—even obsessive—interest. Choose a methodology. The methodologies presented in this book are as follows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.764,r=0.472,b=0.864), with ID c656c07e-091e-4a34-b696-06b078637232 -->

WHAT CAN I INVESTIGATE?
The detail you can investigate is typically a single item, creature, or small location (such as a room or corridor), though the GM might allow a different scope for your investigation. Physical clues are usually the best starting point, but the GM might allow you to start an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar clue. For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. The question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. “Is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an investigator to answer, but “Who left these footprints?” or “What location did this mud come from?” both have enough potential for an investigation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.072,r=0.861,b=0.372), with ID 2299f4e0-37d7-425a-9359-e8567f66c583 -->

You’re trained in Crafting and gain the Alchemical
Crafting skill feat (*Player Core* 252). You start with a
standard formula book (*Player Core* 288), which contains
the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items
of your choice (these must be elixirs or tools), in addition
to the formulas gained from Alchemical Crafting. Each
time you gain a level, you learn the formula for one
common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool of any level
of item you can create. Alchemical elixirs and tools begin
on pages 286 and 295, respectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.418,r=0.862,b=0.572), with ID 235cf0c6-f294-40d2-94ee-3e9e777802f8 -->

You gain the Quick Tincture action, which you can use to turn one of these vials into an elixir or alchemical tool for which you know the formula. If you have the ability to create versatile vials from more than one source (such as the alchemist multiclass archetype), you can use any of your versatile vials for any ability you have that requires them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.633,r=0.863,b=0.740), with ID 075095e8-dcfd-44a3-a10e-4ec8c2b7e38c -->

You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower that’s in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or needing to attempt a Crafting check.

Forensic Medicine  
You’ve learned that in most cases, especially murders, criminals tend to leave more evidence of the crime on the body than they’d like to believe. Information from bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life cycle of carrion insects can provide valuable clues that help reconstruct the scene. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.076,r=0.905,b=0.188), with ID 8c9c61a1-d965-4b00-985d-ac12ed2a3564 -->

You’re trained in Medicine and gain the Forensic Acumen (page 230) and Battle Medicine (*Player Core* 253) skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to your level, and the target becomes temporarily immune for only 1 hour, not 1 day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.189,r=0.905,b=0.281), with ID 8a00d782-3a1f-4e36-8373-56a96d1f6c21 -->

Interrogation  
People can’t help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth of your investigations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.292,r=0.904,b=0.386), with ID ec26fd0f-a19e-4197-bedf-2c2a8411f46c -->

You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No Cause for Alarm skill feat (*Player Core* 259). You can also Pursue a Lead at the same time you Make an Impression, as long as you ask a question related to the creature with which you’re conversing or a topic of your conversation. You also gain the Pointed Question action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.387,r=0.905,b=0.480), with ID 3007b09c-424d-496f-8ae7-4315e8b19a77 -->

POINTED QUESTION

AUDITORY  CONCENTRATE  INVESTIGATOR  LINGUISTIC  MENTAL
You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see. Attempt a Diplomacy check against the creature’s Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target must directly answer your question. It doesn’t have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature attempts to Lie to you. Whether it answers truthfully or not, you glean something from its body language, and it is off-guard to the Strike you make using Devise a Stratagem against it before the end of your turn.
Success As critical success, but the circumstance bonus to your Perception DC is +2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.490,r=0.904,b=0.721), with ID c1457e18-f5f5-4b4b-aef2-298f5db14564 -->

INVESTIGATOR
You’ve mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls for an attack stratagem if you’re using a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club or staff), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for your strategic strike.

THAT'S ODD

FEAT 1

INVESTIGATOR

When you enter a new location, such as a room or corridor, you immediately notice one thing out of the ordinary. The GM determines what it is, or whether there's nothing reasonable to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it's suspicious. For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it's evident to you already, so the GM might note that there's something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out what specifically is out of the ordinary. If you wish, you can Pursue a Lead concerning this detail even if you have Pursed a Lead less than 10 minutes ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.305,r=0.471,b=0.556), with ID 0e4e873e-2e4e-4219-b6b9-580d3f821307 -->

That’s Odd doesn’t reveal whether creatures are suspicious.
You don’t typically get any benefit when you leave and come
back to a place, though if a major change has happened there
and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.556,r=0.470,b=0.619), with ID a7fcd95f-f16e-4ddf-af65-c3af058bbc4c -->

INVESTIGATOR
You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.627,r=0.471,b=0.769), with ID 514851e7-5766-46a6-8372-9777dacfcdca -->

You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.770,r=0.470,b=0.847), with ID f0325508-eb52-4afd-8eb2-20ab249ac353 -->

  • The color palette is dominated by browns, greens, and muted metallics, with pink accents on the ears and tail.
  • The background is plain beige, focusing attention on the character.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • No visible text or labels on the book or accessories.
  • Lighting is even, with soft shadows, and the illustration is rendered in a semi-realistic, painterly style.

Spatial Relationships :

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a character archetype blending intelligence (book, monocle, tools) and martial ability (rapier, armor).
  • The detailed accessories and attire suggest preparedness for both scholarly and adventurous pursuits.
  • The overall composition and attire indicate a fantasy or role-playing game context, emphasizing both personality and function. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.535,r=0.522,b=0.944), with ID f3b99865-bedf-4858-90a4-51610b5430ef -->

INVESTIGATOR
Sometimes your case splinters into smaller mysteries, but you never lose sight of the big picture. Once per day when you give up on the subject of a lead due to using Pursue a Lead again, you can designate the lead you stopped pursuing as your solid lead for the day. Even though you stopped following the solid lead, you can change back to your solid lead any number of times by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. Doing so ends one of your current leads as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.073,r=0.908,b=0.249), with ID fe913abd-1f38-4c64-9037-a9db77c1fcac -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration depicting a dramatic confrontation between a human character and a supernatural, red-ethereal entity in an urban, architectural setting at night.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a man in a tan trench coat and dark clothing, holding a syringe and a baton, facing off against a swirling, red, ghost-like entity.
  • The setting appears to be a city alley or courtyard, with tall, angular buildings and wrought-iron fencing.
  • The perspective is dynamic, with the man in the foreground (right) and the entity in the background (left and center), creating a sense of depth and movement.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with cool blue and purple tones dominating the environment, contrasted by the vivid red and orange glow of the supernatural entity.
  • The colour palette is primarily cool (blues, purples) with strong, saturated reds and oranges for the supernatural elements.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration uses exaggerated lighting and stylized forms typical of fantasy or graphic novel art.
  • The man’s equipment includes a syringe, a baton, and a canister on his back, suggesting preparedness for combat or containment.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The man is in the lower right foreground, partially crouched and looking over his shoulder at the entity.
  • The red entity emerges from the lower left, swirling upward and splitting into two forms—one closer to the man, the other higher up on a building wall, with a vaguely humanoid shape and outstretched arms.
  • The wrought-iron fence separates the man from the entity, adding a sense of barrier or impending confrontation.
  • The composition uses strong diagonal lines, leading the viewer’s eye from the man to the entity and up the building.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a tense, action-oriented moment, emphasizing the threat posed by the supernatural entity and the preparedness of the human character.
  • The use of colour and lighting highlights the supernatural nature of the entity and the seriousness of the confrontation.
  • The spatial arrangement and dynamic poses create a sense of urgency and narrative, suggesting a story of conflict between human and supernatural forces. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.061,r=0.874,b=0.521), with ID fda08114-5173-4a35-911c-03bc00c1113f -->

Trigger A creature targets you with an attack, and you can see the attacker.

You perceive every possible way your foe’s attack could land and attempt to avoid them all. The triggering attack roll targets your Perception DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.750,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID b01a2c87-6395-491a-9b19-bac63da4020f -->

You get an indistinct mental impression of significant events that happened there.

Trigger You specify the trigger when you make your daily preparations (see Requirements below).
Requirements When you make your daily preparations, you must specify a trigger for this reaction using the same restrictions as the triggers for the Ready action. You also choose a single spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list of 4th level or lower. The spell can’t have a cost, nor can its casting time be more than 10 minutes.

Whether from jury-rigged magic items, deduction from the
study of magical interactions, or other means, you have a
contingency in your back pocket for desperate situations.
When the trigger occurs, you cause the spell to come into
effect. The spell targets only you, no matter how many
creatures it would affect normally. If you define particularly
complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger
might fail. Once the contingency is triggered, the spell is
expended until your next daily preparations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.356,r=0.860,b=0.495), with ID 8493d4e8-2ae2-4fe4-858b-5b88520e0c36 -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a martial artist or monk character, depicted in dynamic motion and adorned with various weapons and accessories.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a bald, barefoot humanoid figure in a martial arts pose, wearing layered blue and white robes with intricate patterns and numerous white cloth ties.
  • The character is equipped with multiple weapons and items, including a curved sword, a wooden staff, a dagger, a gourd flask, a pouch, and a large ring with tassels.
  • The figure's hands are wrapped, and the right hand is clenched in a fist while the left holds the sword.
  • The overall colour palette is dominated by deep blue, white, and gold accents, with some brown and red details on accessories.
  • The illustration is rendered in a semi-realistic, high-fantasy art style with strong attention to fabric folds, weapon details, and dynamic posture.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar, text, or UI elements.
  • The image is cleanly cut out on a white background, with no environmental context or background elements.

Spatial Relationships :

MONK   STANCE
Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon’s tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

MONK   STANCE
Requirements You are unarmored and wielding a longbow, a shortbow, or a bow with the monk trait.
You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered around the use of a bow. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are those using longbows, shortbows, or bows with the monk trait. You can use Flurry of Blows with these bows. You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50 feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the feat or ability doesn’t require a single, specific Strike. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.290,r=0.905,b=0.493), with ID ca639ba7-947d-4ac1-8cf1-9b53e09c9238 -->

MONASTIC WEAPONRY FEAT 1

MONK
You have trained with the weaponry of your monastery or school. You gain access to uncommon weapons with the monk trait and become trained in simple and martial monk weapons. When your proficiency for unarmed attacks increases to expert or master, your proficiency rank for these weapons increases to expert or master as well. If you have familiarity with an agile or finesse weapon (such as from the Catfolk Weapon Familiarity feat), that weapon also gains the monk trait for you.

You can use melee monk weapons with any of your monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks, though not if the feat or ability requires you to use a single specific type of attack, such as Crane Stance.

If you gain the critical specialization benefit for unarmed attacks—with the expert strikes class feature, for example—you also gain it with monk weapons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.597,r=0.905,b=0.878), with ID 030c74f1-d16a-4a2e-91bc-4b933b830175 -->

You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique created by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight of an avalanche and block blows with your garments.

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.
   Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
   Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.092,r=0.850,b=0.263), with ID bb648965-0d69-4826-867b-3d6136377ad7 -->

Qi Spells: By tapping into an inner reserve of energy, called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs; your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. You also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to steady your mind and breath to draw in more qi from the world around you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.265,r=0.849,b=0.448), with ID 60aacfad-1da9-4b60-97bd-76bc12fea901 -->

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. The maximum Focus Points your focus
pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you
have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules
for focus spells appear on page 298 of Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.449,r=0.848,b=0.525), with ID 67975ea6-fb31-4122-9822-4626a540fed7 -->

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.525,r=0.847,b=0.662), with ID b699353c-9ee5-4393-a74e-76eba93774e1 -->

**Venomous:** These weapons inject poison into every hit. When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an additional 1 persistent poison damage. This increases to 2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a *greater striking rune*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.503,t=0.664,r=0.846,b=0.739), with ID 7958b846-5dc1-442c-835b-437237b34bc2 -->

If you're flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.768,r=0.859,b=0.802), with ID ac3ce26d-c177-42fc-9208-ba377dc70822 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a dynamic combat scene between a human martial artist and a large green-skinned monster, set among ancient ruins in a mountainous landscape.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a bald, dark-skinned martial artist in blue and white robes, performing a flying kick to the face of a large, green-skinned, tusked monster.
  • The setting is outdoors, with snow-capped mountains in the background and ancient, crumbling stone ruins in the foreground and midground.
  • The composition is action-oriented, with the martial artist airborne and the monster recoiling from the impact.
  • The colour palette features natural earth tones, greens, blues, and whites, with strong lighting suggesting daylight.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit measurements are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible musculature, fabric folds, and facial expressions.
  • No on-image text or user interface elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The martial artist is positioned in the right midground, mid-air, with his left leg extended in a kick to the monster’s jaw.
  • The monster occupies the left foreground, with its head turned from the impact and one arm raised defensively.
  • Ruined stone statues and architectural fragments are scattered around, including a large broken statue head in the lower right.
  • The background features towering, snow-covered mountains and a blue sky with a bird in flight.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of motion, power, and fantasy heroism, emphasizing the martial artist’s agility and strength against a much larger foe.
  • The ruined setting and mountainous backdrop enhance the epic and mythic atmosphere of the scene.
  • The focus is on the moment of impact, with dynamic poses and dramatic composition drawing the viewer’s eye to the clash between the two characters. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.523), with ID d1341de7-8054-4411-919c-14caef7061cd -->

# ORACLE

Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.044,t=0.065,r=0.868,b=0.228), with ID 696b52f8-985a-44dd-b8d9-845abf1160c5 -->

KEY ATTRIBUTE
Charisma
At 1st level, your class gives you
an attribute boost to Charisma. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.255,r=0.323,b=0.341), with ID f0bb75ff-2ee3-4ab2-9d75-7a9b419da317 -->

HIT POINTS  
8 plus your Constitution modifier  
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.343,t=0.255,r=0.589,b=0.347), with ID 2fe6616a-3f9e-4318-a134-830baeceda17 -->

During Combat Encounters...
You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.365,r=0.585,b=0.466), with ID 496eb22f-3eff-4195-8795-017a1d36dbfd -->

**During Social Encounters...**
You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.473,r=0.583,b=0.529), with ID f69040bc-52e7-4e91-b42b-112b41103ff8 -->

While Exploring...
You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery’s power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.534,r=0.582,b=0.621), with ID 4e0f916d-cc43-411d-ad20-89d4f9eebc16 -->

In Downtime...
You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.627,r=0.582,b=0.726), with ID 44379622-0762-43ce-9965-4fb00b93f46c -->

- You might...
- • View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.
- • Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.
- • Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.735,r=0.583,b=0.819), with ID 79bb7e95-05bb-41c9-a8a6-409985143d2b -->

- Others Probably...
  - Don’t realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.
  - Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.
  - Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.827,r=0.584,b=0.941), with ID d83f3f59-3541-4d21-826b-c9efb9f0b566 -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.801,r=0.513,b=0.878), with ID 99c01c13-4627-4319-a501-687aef02b452 -->

Initial Proficiencies  
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.889,r=0.512,b=0.941), with ID ed71ebd8-5892-4193-b60f-3ddba01a5433 -->

## Oracle Spellcasting
You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.078,r=0.904,b=0.233), with ID 2feedddc-8b03-42f1-963a-fc973c995851 -->

Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.235,r=0.903,b=0.295), with ID 8023b9fd-11ab-4b80-b5f2-152cb670ef33 -->

As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table on page 131. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.296,r=0.903,b=0.355), with ID e858baad-ed40-4500-a2ab-e117d4494e16 -->

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.358,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID 11009318-6d97-41a3-b4c9-5395962ced04 -->

Heightening Spells  
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks (Player Core 297). The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.446,r=0.903,b=0.586), with ID 8a85844e-38cf-4414-9c6e-e6b1f902d910 -->

Cantrips  
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.600,r=0.903,b=0.739), with ID 3746f8df-2bf4-483b-ac45-78ca78595578 -->

Spell Repertoire  
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the divine list or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.752,r=0.903,b=0.877), with ID 49a69726-7396-4844-8d0a-e2a598ccf1bf -->

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Oracle Spells per Day
table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same
rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.879,r=0.902,b=0.938), with ID f3ce0355-db0d-4262-97fc-800ba0a0258d -->

Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire  
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core 440). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.598,r=0.470,b=0.711), with ID 44a9ac77-5b0c-4da2-af7f-6fc98f736908 -->

Mystery  
An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle’s mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.721,r=0.469,b=0.831), with ID eb6813fa-85b7-49a7-88ac-82482cf1d420 -->

Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your
mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus
spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you
a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the
divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse
that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.833,r=0.469,b=0.933), with ID 02b4f238-0e2e-413f-9431-015866397832 -->

Ancestors (page 135): Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.

Battle (page 135): You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.

Bones (page 135): Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.

Cosmos (page 136): You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.

Flames (page 136): You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.

Life (page 137): The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.

Lore (page 137): You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.

Tempest (page 137): Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.465,r=0.861,b=0.708), with ID c55ba985-b10a-4da8-9c1a-8ad698d93be0 -->

Revelation Spells
The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.722,r=0.860,b=0.877), with ID c976800f-e14e-44d3-91f3-644d034abb31 -->

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your

Oracular Curse  
As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse.

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a humanoid crow or raven character dressed in elaborate, East Asian-inspired robes and carrying various magical and scholarly items, suggesting a spellcaster or sage archetype.

illustration:

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference is present.
  • Several runic or magical symbols are visible on the staff, sash, and accessories.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible feather texture and fabric patterns.
  • No on-image UI elements or digital overlays.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is centrally placed, occupying most of the frame.
  • The staff is held in the left hand and extends upward and leftward, while the right hand is relaxed at the side.
  • The large pack and scrolls are slung over the right shoulder, balancing the composition.
  • Accessories and charms hang from the belt and sash, creating visual interest around the torso and waist.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys the identity of a magical scholar or sage, blending avian and human features with East Asian fantasy aesthetics.

  • The character’s upright, confident posture and elaborate costume indicate importance or high status within a fantasy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.345,r=0.571,b=0.918), with ID e3de94c3-79a1-4b7f-9579-b93e3aa3f1a0 -->

cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens,
but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its
grip on your soul. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.081,r=0.904,b=0.126), with ID 707da7cf-f9da-4cee-acca-99b46d373040 -->

Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound
condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles.
Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound
ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a
cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you
increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after
the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only
a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound
condition can’t increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow
in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and
your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4.
Once saturated in divine power, your soul can’t absorb any
more, and so you can’t use a cursebound ability if you are
already at your maximum cursebound condition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.128,r=0.903,b=0.341), with ID 80a5189c-8afd-4726-b381-eb946d129cc2 -->

Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures concealed from you, you can’t negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as *sure strike* (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, *cleanse affliction* and similar abilities don’t affect your curse at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.343,r=0.904,b=0.570), with ID 3f875d14-492c-4826-af2a-91eeac111a22 -->

lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If
you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with

KEY TERMS
You’ll see these key terms in many oracle class features.

Cursebound: Abilities with this trait tighten your oracular curse’s grasp on your soul in exchange for divine insights, giving you the cursebound condition (see below). When you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, or if you were already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1. As cursebound abilities are directly linked to your oracular curse, you can’t use a cursebound ability if you don’t have an oracular curse or if you are already at your maximum cursebound value. You can’t mitigate or bypass the drawbacks of any cursebound ability with spells or other effects (see Oracular Curse on page 132), and the effects of any cursebound ability end when you Refocus and remove the cursebound condition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.498,t=0.083,r=0.849,b=0.341), with ID 87eb53b5-972a-4c4f-a373-3b8be713c1e0 -->

Fortune and Misfortune: Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.499,t=0.342,r=0.849,b=0.479), with ID b08f0e5b-ca56-4e89-b3bd-be625bab7f75 -->

**Spellshape:** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the spellshape action itself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.479,r=0.848,b=0.617), with ID 3a632abe-546a-4066-9634-665ed0c6fb97 -->

# THE CURSEBOUND CONDITION
Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery’s powers. Cursebound is a condition that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular curse imposes unique negative effects depending on your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound condition only by Refocusing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.628,r=0.850,b=0.773), with ID 346e6698-81be-49f6-80f7-dea5d4cb3686 -->

MYSTERIES
Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power. Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all the deities with power over the subject of your mystery, veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery determines the revelation spells you can cast and the oracular curse that overtakes your body. You learn skills related to that mystery, gain access to a cantrip, and gain a special benefit drawn from the combined divine knowledge and experience of your mystery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.705,r=0.905,b=0.878), with ID 834e4d74-4fd2-4ac4-a6e1-602d7ac4005f -->

## Ancestors
The voices of generations past speak to you, and you hear their words. You might resent the constant interruption, or you might revere the spirits of those who came before. Perhaps you hail from a culture with strong ancestral traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan), a traditional dwarven community that worships Torag’s family pantheon, or a group that reveres Erastil or Pharasma. You might commune with powerful psychopomps who shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself, or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them to meddle in your worldly affairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.413,r=0.473,b=0.648), with ID 09a55bfe-6eef-4dc6-b94f-632f94e16cee -->

CURSE OF ANCESTRAL MEDDLING

CURSE  DIVINE  ORACLE  SPIRIT

The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a well-intentioned (but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of the above. When you have the cursebound condition, you are clumsy with a value equal to your cursebound value as the spirits of your ancestors temporarily possess you and vie for control in your mind, hindering your movements. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.765,r=0.472,b=0.941), with ID 0a99b7f7-d190-43ab-9b13-0ac925f9d90f -->

Battle  
Warlike forces fill you with physical might and tactical knowledge, aiming to have you uphold the glory of combat, fight to improve the world, prepare against the necessity of conflict, or endure the inevitability of war. You might draw upon deities such as Gorum, Iomedae, Rovagug, the Horseman of War Szuriel, the Queen of the Night Eiseth, the Vudrani god Diomazul, and others, or you might find power in the unending conflict between the armies of Heaven and Hell, the Elemental Planes, the Outer Gods, or even the collective spirits of those who fought in wars over the ages. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.076,r=0.863,b=0.264), with ID cb3364f2-7fb3-4bbe-b50e-284319096966 -->

CURSE OF THE MORTAL WARRIOR

CURSE   DIVINE   ORACLE

You thrive in the thick of battle, but your mystery’s sheer focus on the physical and material leaves your soul weak against the tricks of spellcraft. You smell faintly of steel and blood no matter how you try to remove or mask the scent, you appear more imposing and muscular than you actually are, and you hear the faint clash and clamor of battle in the distance at all times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.382,r=0.862,b=0.509), with ID b11d8554-f5d4-4acf-bbbd-b07d21531e52 -->

Bones  
Your mystery imparts an understanding of death and undeath in all their macabre complexity. You might have had a brush with death yourself—maybe even dying and returning to life—or carry the touch of undeath in your blood. If you commune with deities, you might speak with guardians of death like Pharasma and the psychopomp ushers (the most powerful among creatures that guide souls through the afterlife); a bringer of death like the Mantis God Achaekek or the Horseman of the Apocalypse Charon; or a herald of undeath such as Urgathoa.

CURSE OF LIVING DEATH

CURSE   DIVINE   ORACLE   VOID   VITALITY

Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death, making you susceptible to both void and vitality damage. You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.074,r=0.906,b=0.188), with ID b5b0d833-c1b0-4c63-af61-105d7b405ec4 -->

Cosmos  
Celestial bodies great and small exert influence on you, giving you sublime cosmic power. Perhaps you see the glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between. You might uphold deities like Desna, Sarenrae, or the deific lovers Shizuru and Tsukiyo who represent the sun and the moon— or you might draw power from dark entities from beyond the stars, like certain Outer Gods, or destructive gods of the night like Zon-Kuthon or the rat goddess Lao Shu Po. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.337,r=0.905,b=0.494), with ID 2f6686c5-10a7-4be6-9f14-98f028892ba0 -->

CURSE OF THE SKY’S CALL

CURSE   DIVINE   ORACLE

Your body is drawn toward the heavens, making you lighter and less substantial than you should be. Your eyes glow with starry light, and your hair and clothing float and drift around you. When you have the cursebound condition, you are enfeebled with a value equal to your cursebound value, and you take a status penalty to saves and DCs against all forms of forced movement equal to your cursebound value. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.612,r=0.905,b=0.756), with ID 2d29e865-f5d3-4cac-910c-b9bb14fb9820 -->

**Flames**
Fire lives at the center of the world, the center of the sun, and the center of civilization. You might revere this elemental force, siphon power from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or venerate a collection of deities such as Asmodeus, Sarenrae, the Tian goddess of disasters and volcanoes Lady Nanbyo, or the elemental lord of fire Ymeri. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.767,r=0.904,b=0.878), with ID b5dbb178-4fce-484c-ae04-45dcd85215d3 -->

Summary : This image displays a large, bold numeral "2" centered on a textured, gold-brown background.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is the number "2" in a thick, dark brown font with a light outline.
  • The number is centered both vertically and horizontally.
  • Background is a mottled, sandy gold-brown color with a subtle texture.
  • Lighting is even, with no visible shadows or highlights.
  • Colour palette consists mainly of brown and gold tones.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • No additional text, icons, or UI elements visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "2" is the only element, occupying the central area of the image.
  • No foreground or background separation; the number sits directly on the textured field.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended to represent the number "2" in a visually prominent way, possibly as part of a sequence or for labeling purposes. The bold font and high contrast ensure legibility against the textured background. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.876,t=0.005,r=1.000,b=0.062), with ID d0bd0b78-71f9-4a6b-9460-cd2f8f1f8422 -->

CURSE OF ENGULFING FLAMES
CURSE  DIVINE  FIRE  ORACLE
Fires flare noticeably (though not dangerously) in your presence, you occasionally smoke slightly, and your body is almost painfully hot to the touch. When you have the cursebound condition, you catch fire, taking persistent fire damage equal to your cursebound value. The flames shed light like a torch, and if you enter an environment where they could not burn (such as underwater), you simply seethe with flameless heat. The flames subside when you begin Refocusing to assuage your curse or if you fall unconscious, but they resume if your Refocus activity is interrupted or when you return to consciousness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.136,r=0.472,b=0.343), with ID 4960b920-2459-41cc-b211-21c81f4a73b4 -->

Life  
The never-ending flow of life force within living beings is palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity of life, or perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might draw power from the collective vitality of the world’s living creatures, hold some connection to Creation’s Forge, or revere a collection of deities including Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae, and the god of medicine Qi Zhong.

CURSE OF OUTPOURING LIFE

CURSE   DIVINE   ORACLE

Life energy flows outward from you and connects you to all living things, but you expend your vital essence to do so. Your presence comforts the ill and injured, causes scars to fade slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and otherwise infuses your surroundings with vitality. As your life force seeps outward, it becomes more difficult to keep your body functioning. Magical effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal to your level (minimum 1) times your cursebound value to the number of HP you recover. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.597,r=0.471,b=0.772), with ID be0524f0-d19b-4488-8f67-2d6ce660fca4 -->

Lore  
Knowledge and information come freely to you. You might use this lore to gain power or perhaps to understand the divine mysteries of the multiverse. You might have a conduit to the fabled Akashic Record, maintain a subtle telepathic connection to the collective subconscious of all living creatures, or follow in the footsteps of deities such as Abadar, Irori, Nethys, Irori’s scholarly nephew Gruhastha, the fey triune goddess of fate Magdh, or the aeon god figure known as the Monad. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.783,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID cd03c35c-70e5-452d-8990-44eb0e245952 -->

## CURSE OF TORRENTIAL KNOWLEDGE

CURSE  DIVINE  ORACLE  
You have a link to true divine knowledge, but your mortal mind struggles to process and act on what you know. Loose materials around you, such as dust, grains of rice, and droplets of water, slowly shift to form strange runes or faint, indecipherable writing, and you sometimes speak unintelligible truths or statements in unknown languages without realizing it. You take a status penalty to Perception checks and Will saving throws equal to your cursebound value due to the torrential distractions of unasked-for knowledge flooding your mind. If you are cursebound 4, you additionally can’t speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise communicate with your allies, and you are stupefied 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.198,r=0.862,b=0.404), with ID 390b8158-e487-49f2-a43b-deff1ea98c6b -->

**Tempest**  
The fury of the wind and waves pounds in your heart, whether your power flows from natural storms, a conduit to the elemental Planes of Air and Water, or through reverence of deities such as Gozreh, the tengu god of storms Hei Feng, the pirate queen Besmara, or the elemental lords of air and water. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.414,r=0.860,b=0.509), with ID 05236b58-9010-4261-bacf-c206b8492ced -->

CURSE OF INCLEMENT HEADWINDS

CURSE   DIVINE   ORACLE

The weather seems to always oppose you in ways large and small. Even when you are calm and at rest, your hair and clothing are inconveniently blown about by gentle winds, you are slightly damp from the faintest drizzle, and your touch often comes with a static shock. When you have the cursebound condition, you are opposed by the elements, with the following effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.628,r=0.861,b=0.769), with ID a724a579-2038-46a2-bf18-c38896a65f26 -->

FORETELL HARM ◇ FEAT 1
CURSEBOUND  DIVINE  ORACLE
Frequency once per round
Requirements Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that dealt damage.
Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse injury in the target’s future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it takes damage equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire damage, a flame might spontaneous ignite on them or they might burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune to Foretell Harm for 24 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.149,r=0.515,b=0.389), with ID 0326ce73-9445-4b0d-b5d9-90d57331cd7e -->

DIVINE   ORACLE   SECRET
You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety of potentially useful information. Attempt a Religion check to understand the information you gain.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a humanoid raven character dressed in ornate robes, holding a staff, and casting a stream of blue water magic.
  • The setting is a dense, burning forest with intense orange and yellow flames engulfing trees and ground.
  • Several skeletal or zombie-like quadruped animals are depicted fleeing from the fire in the background.
  • The composition is dynamic, with the raven mage on the right, water magic arcing from right to left, and fire dominating the left and background.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with strong contrasts between the bright fire, cool blue water, and dark forest shadows.
  • Colour palette features fiery oranges, yellows, and reds contrasted with cool blues and dark browns/blacks.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • Some runic or magical symbols are visible on the mage’s robes and staff.

Summary : This is a character class reference sheet for a "Lifebringer" Oracle in a fantasy role-playing game, outlining the class's focus, recommended attributes, skills, mystery, and class feats, accompanied by a full-body character illustration.

  • The color palette features blues, purples, golds, and browns, with intricate patterns on the character's robe.

Technical Details :  
  • The character wears a long blue robe with pink trim and swirling designs, yellow pants, and brown boots.  
  • Accessories include a belt, a cross-body satchel, and a staff.  
  • The character has pointed ears and vibrant, styled hair.  
  • The text above the illustration provides detailed information about the "Lifebringer" Oracle, including:  
    – Class focus: supportive magic and healing.  
    – Attribute scores: Charisma, Wisdom, Intelligence.  
    – Skills: Herbalism Lore, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Survival.  
    – Mystery: Life.  
    – Feats: Nudge the Scales (1st), Reach Spell (1st), Knowledge of Shapes (4th), Gifted Power (6th), Read Disaster (8th), Waters of Creation (10th).

You have a vague connection to the Ethereal Plane that enables you to notice spirits.

You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, while Seeking, and on the automatic secret check you gain while exploring even if you aren’t Searching. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object. When you notice a creature with this sense, you also learn its location, making it hidden to you if it had been undetected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.587,r=0.905,b=0.710), with ID af722443-299a-4f86-94f8-579c9ae4063a -->

You gain the effects of augury, except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of “good” are instead “nothing,” and results of “mixed” are instead “bad.” If you are legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.151,r=0.471,b=0.282), with ID 7d9257db-8590-4765-be05-f9632587fff7 -->

You focus the power of your spell to overcome enemies’
resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell
ignores an amount of the target’s resistance equal to your level
against the following types of damage: spirit, vitality, and void.
This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent
damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. This
doesn’t cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.289,r=0.471,b=0.435), with ID 48e4fb4b-94bb-457d-81d2-e9dde104c491 -->

Summary : This is a full-body fantasy illustration of a heavily armored warrior holding a sword with a glowing red aura, set against a plain parchment-like background.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid warrior in ornate, gold-trimmed plate armor, standing upright and holding a two-handed sword vertically in front.
  • The armor features intricate gold detailing, shoulder pauldrons, and a chainmail skirt.
  • The sword emits a red, smoky glow along its blade, suggesting magical or supernatural properties.
  • The warrior has long, dark braided hair and greenish skin, indicating a non-human or fantasy race (such as half-orc or orc).
  • The background is plain and beige, focusing attention on the character.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar, text, or UI elements.
  • The illustration uses a muted, earthy color palette with metallic gold and steel tones, accented by the red glow of the sword.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is centered, occupying most of the vertical space.
  • The sword is held in both hands, tip resting on the ground, with the red glow extending downward.
  • A sheathed secondary sword or dagger is visible at the character’s left hip.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys strength, readiness, and a sense of magical power through the character’s stance, detailed armor, and the glowing sword.
  • The plain background ensures the viewer’s focus remains on the character and their equipment.
  • The red aura on the sword suggests the character may possess magical abilities or wield an enchanted weapon. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.143,t=0.508,r=0.510,b=0.984), with ID 9270dfb8-1ea1-4edf-b47e-610ff257ad9d -->

# SORCERER

You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s magic in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.063,r=0.869,b=0.227), with ID 1c6fd60e-d616-47d8-a399-8ee872045d60 -->

KEY ATTRIBUTE
Charisma
At 1st level, your class gives you
an attribute boost to Charisma. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.253,r=0.324,b=0.342), with ID 1d62ecac-134d-4c2d-bf7a-87b0a354e5c9 -->

HIT POINTS  
6 plus your Constitution modifier  
You increase your maximum number  
of HP by this number at 1st level and  
every level thereafter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.339,t=0.254,r=0.591,b=0.347), with ID 68f5deb6-0196-4afa-99a9-a961d629aa20 -->

During combat encounters...
You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after you’ve used such spells up). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.365,r=0.604,b=0.483), with ID 9289667e-522a-453f-8358-46dc11d96fb2 -->

**During social encounters...**

**While exploring...**
You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of magical traps. When your group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.533,r=0.604,b=0.606), with ID fce80f66-7820-410c-a9c0-b31060a96657 -->

In downtime...
You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.611,r=0.604,b=0.668), with ID d1b38f2a-72d9-48ba-9e80-b5996bc6978a -->

- You might...
  - Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.
  - View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
  - Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.672,r=0.605,b=0.805), with ID 8095f91e-c5c3-4f71-bb15-1b0221fc77cb -->

- Others probably...
  - Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
  - Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other disciplined practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.
  - Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.809,r=0.607,b=0.945), with ID 23cd5288-fefd-4d3f-8fb6-10c391f89e13 -->

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.674,r=0.513,b=0.741), with ID 93dc6e99-290f-4cd1-abcb-a6682d196bea -->

Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.751,r=0.512,b=0.800), with ID 2d713a1d-2970-4c7e-9b66-f1345dd5ab1f -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.801,r=0.513,b=0.878), with ID 74254d8a-73de-47a7-b4ed-a70daeaf8893 -->

Initial Proficiencies  
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.889,r=0.513,b=0.941), with ID b765c675-8144-45c8-86ea-4f1f6a984287 -->

Bloodline
Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.
This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the
spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you
learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus
Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The
bloodlines presented in this book are as follows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.077,r=0.905,b=0.187), with ID 917dbc5a-5165-4bb4-a5fe-6c34b7b648f8 -->

Angelic: Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.
Demonic: A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.
Diabolic: A bond with devils gives you divine spells.
Draconic: The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.
Elemental: The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.220,r=0.902,b=0.309), with ID 28f4e17e-6b0a-445b-a542-0dd77ff35c8e -->

Fey: Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.
Hag: The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.
Imperial: An ancient power grants you arcane spells.
Undead: The touch of death gives you divine spells.
See Bloodlines on page 149 for more information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.542,t=0.311,r=0.881,b=0.388), with ID 1fbb1c00-cdc0-40f8-a495-6fb3292afb61 -->

Sorcerer Spellcasting  
Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity (Player Core 299). The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.400,r=0.904,b=0.555), with ID b45cccfd-083a-4bef-b04c-3d3c8572dbbc -->

Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.557,r=0.903,b=0.617), with ID 338edcca-d9b6-41de-8440-3ad374d6ed25 -->

As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells
you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table
on page 147. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.618,r=0.903,b=0.677), with ID d8e322d4-0828-4bf4-aaf2-3e1885940138 -->

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403
of Player Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.679,r=0.903,b=0.784), with ID ac728466-86d9-49eb-90be-bd3302b4d8ef -->

Heightening Spells  
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can  
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.  
This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the  
spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at  
the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that  
rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.798,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID b51d232d-bad8-4d60-9f26-032ad7ca45f2 -->

* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.075,r=0.862,b=0.453), with ID e916c6cb-7277-43e7-8275-1401838aad2c -->

Cantrips  
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type  
of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip  
at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always  
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—  
this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell  
slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your  
cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer,  
your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.461,r=0.471,b=0.604), with ID 28439553-7576-45dc-a4fd-f7f21b3a931b -->

Spell Repertoire  
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (page 149). You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.612,r=0.471,b=0.770), with ID c1e1c697-f98e-40a5-a8c5-ddc1a35cc6f3 -->

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per
Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire
of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your
first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that
rank that’s listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the
other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell;
at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and
two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells,
you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already
know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.771,r=0.470,b=0.940), with ID d2c96bbd-19f5-4cd1-8ae0-2e53eb9460e0 -->

Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots  
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a  
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it  
wouldn’t give you another spell slot or vice versa. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.464,r=0.860,b=0.527), with ID 92820f1f-ee4f-4d8b-8c52-bc29f62a131b -->

Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire  
As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can’t swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core 440). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.537,r=0.862,b=0.678), with ID 235b4c90-6171-475b-bc84-5d82638b6842 -->

Sorcerous Potency  
Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell’s damage or healing equal to the spell’s rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.690,r=0.861,b=0.862), with ID dc2f7aff-f9ba-4695-92bf-8bc10f9efd8b -->

Skill Feats                                            2nd  
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat (Player Core 249). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.874,r=0.861,b=0.940), with ID 339ca97e-cfcc-49de-8f78-e6424750a397 -->

Pathfinder Player Core 2

Sorcerer Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 152.

General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat (Player Core 249).

Signature Spells 3rd
Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.119,t=0.016,r=0.515,b=0.357), with ID b52f6cf1-147a-4957-bd2c-befd47442949 -->

Bloodline Paragon 19th  
You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.243,r=0.472,b=0.404), with ID be958935-795c-48bb-83c1-0978056f8ce6 -->

BLOODLINES  
Your bloodline determines your spell list, the tradition of spells you cast, and grants you access to two trained skills. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.490,r=0.471,b=0.543), with ID 30dbe5a9-64b8-468d-be14-5293d44f62b3 -->

Bloodline Spells
Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells
unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus
spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you
start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your
focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don’t need
to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing
through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.
These spells can be found starting on page 262. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.551,r=0.471,b=0.723), with ID 2d6fdaa1-32af-4719-b35b-89d6cafe669b -->

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots; you can’t cast them using spell slots.
The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is
equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can
never be more than 3 points. The full rules are on page
298 of _Player Core_. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.724,r=0.470,b=0.831), with ID 545cf375-7de1-421b-bde8-2249782641a5 -->

KEY TERMS
You'll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities.
  Blood Magic: Casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit from a blood magic effect you know. You can typically only benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some feats and abilities may change this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.087,r=0.849,b=0.203), with ID 43928223-84a5-490a-96b0-7ad6dee88ae1 -->

**Spellshape:** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.502,t=0.204,r=0.850,b=0.342), with ID b2a75ae0-50f2-4071-b113-c5314e33cb32 -->

Sorcerous Gifts You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire feature listed on page 147. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.372,r=0.860,b=0.448), with ID 19a8ca1c-8303-419e-88b5-0c38de4d8401 -->

**Bloodline Spells** You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline (page 154) and Greater Bloodline (page 154) feats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.449,r=0.861,b=0.509), with ID 638e7be8-89b5-4af8-a300-edfc6609c6fd -->

**Blood Magic** Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from. You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and can gain others through sorcerer feats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.510,r=0.860,b=0.585), with ID 9c7b020a-735a-4035-8204-ae9cd331e38d -->

If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before
resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after
resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against
a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the
foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must
designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the
spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references
to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.500,t=0.587,r=0.860,b=0.710), with ID 6c302b11-245a-49bf-848b-9a3fb7526482 -->

# SWASHBUCKLER

Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.047,t=0.065,r=0.866,b=0.212), with ID 5ce0e216-1614-4fda-b991-8e02044fc79e -->

During combat encounters...
You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler’s style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.366,r=0.603,b=0.468), with ID df1c9812-4ad9-4c9f-8a66-dbba0d1b8c4a -->

**While exploring...**

## Ancestry and Background
In addition what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.736,r=0.514,b=0.802), with ID a0cbb292-cbcd-48e4-a900-28058769c158 -->

Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.812,r=0.513,b=0.861), with ID a802ece8-aaeb-4113-80d4-72f75cadffd4 -->

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.862,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID 4228bdfe-8562-4f37-94a5-a86f9d29e4be -->

**Initial Proficiencies**  
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.076,r=0.904,b=0.129), with ID 9ad90ae5-9204-4bd5-9bb2-781fb56b1a52 -->

Panache  
You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.138,r=0.903,b=0.234), with ID c049c68c-6222-4495-9785-90a274a368ba -->

You gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. Tumble Through (*Player Core* 233) and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler’s style (see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.234,r=0.904,b=0.387), with ID f714b530-fd5e-4b55-a6cf-d7fdf20df7b0 -->

Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher
(page 161), can be used only while you have panache and
cause you to lose your panache. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.388,r=0.903,b=0.433), with ID 6691638b-9f16-44e3-8687-c3cdb5c3a33d -->

**Precise Strike**  
When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.445,r=0.903,b=0.524), with ID 72484e9d-95e6-43ad-9360-33bf59449191 -->

As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your
additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and
17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a
Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.526,r=0.903,b=0.586), with ID 28fc5c4a-bf5b-4f5e-984f-fb41bd19d9a3 -->

Stylish Combatant  
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.599,r=0.902,b=0.664), with ID 91c9d786-add5-412c-8563-f76573300ee0 -->

### Swashbuckler’s Style
Your own distinctive style lets you gracefully handle any situation. Choose a swashbuckler’s style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.675,r=0.903,b=0.755), with ID 17403160-4a1b-4f50-bfa4-32975903fe91 -->

FLASHY DODGE ↻                                            FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger A creature you can see targets you with an attack.
Requirements You aren’t encumbered.
You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the Strike misses, you gain panache until the end of your next turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.827,r=0.470,b=0.941), with ID bf5250c9-22d9-46f7-8a69-7b879ddce889 -->

KEY TERMS
You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.
  Bravado: Actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn. These effects can be applied even if the action had no other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.091,r=0.847,b=0.233), with ID 0871b4ea-0a9b-464f-b100-678ce7cbbee8 -->

**Finisher:** Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. Finishers can be used only with weapons that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks, for most swashbucklers). You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can’t use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.235,r=0.846,b=0.356), with ID 071a13d0-9686-4ebb-abef-d2ee60149114 -->

Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure.
Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If
your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply
the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this
when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.357,r=0.847,b=0.433), with ID 51f3d601-61a2-492a-a5b1-60f62320d46d -->

**Flourish:** Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.501,t=0.434,r=0.847,b=0.494), with ID c8a757ae-0a67-4edd-a50d-7f17a37c3333 -->

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.496,r=0.848,b=0.629), with ID 9f8d7d21-804a-4294-9b52-30c99a9215f6 -->

FLYING BLADE FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites precise strike
You apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. You apply your precise strike damage on ranged Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon’s first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or finesse weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged Strike for Confident Finisher and any other finisher that includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.658,r=0.861,b=0.816), with ID 55c3e3ef-32b8-4945-8bcd-861193b0a771 -->

When you use Flashy Dodge and the triggering attack fails or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the move trait. You can use Flashy Roll while Flying or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.494,r=0.470,b=0.588), with ID 4f50eaff-8333-41f6-8e55-693601296864 -->

SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
Somehow you always escape the reaper by a hair’s breadth.
You avoid being knocked out or killed and remain at 1 Hit Point and gain panache, but you become doomed 1 (or increase your doomed value by 1 if you were already doomed). You can’t reduce or ignore the doomed condition from Cheating Death. The doomed condition from Cheating Death lasts for 10 minutes, though this doesn’t affect the duration of any other doomed condition you have. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.069,r=0.907,b=0.282), with ID 9fd2f5a9-a5ad-46b5-a8ba-02ba47c87942 -->

GET USED TO DISAPPOINTMENT ◇                FEAT 12

BRAVADO   SWASHBUCKLER

Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
Requirements Your turn begins, and one target within 30 feet failed an attack roll or skill check against you on its last turn.
You capitalize on an opponent’s failure with smug attitude and swagger, reminding them of the gap in skill between you and your opponent. You attempt to Demoralize the opponent. Regardless of the result, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.288,r=0.907,b=0.449), with ID 87405439-e50b-4873-b0ee-7796c0c65df5 -->

You attack in motion. Stride and then Strike. You can use Mobile
  Finisher while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or
  Swimming instead of Striding if you have the
  corresponding movement type. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.456,r=0.908,b=0.559), with ID 336b6a45-0068-4157-baa3-4af11204856c -->

   BRAVADO   SWASHBUCKLER
With reckless speed, you dash, jump and swing around a creature to find a more vulnerable spot. Attempt to Tumble Through a creature at least one size category larger than you, using the following effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.564,r=0.907,b=0.663), with ID 2c11c1f5-735f-4a83-b40f-97069de5d326 -->

Critical Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target’s square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.663,r=0.907,b=0.771), with ID 6d2d913f-0ea8-4f73-bfc7-1f8ceba171e6 -->

**Success** As success, but the weakness applies only against the next attack you make against the target.
**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and you fall prone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.770,r=0.907,b=0.848), with ID bfe1e38a-be1e-4e42-b3fa-8b58d87dded3 -->

Requirements You are capable of using a finisher.
You stylishly leap and deliver a powerful finisher. Make a Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump and attempt one single-action finisher at any point during your jump; the finisher can’t be one that includes other movement, such as Mobile Finisher. Immediately after the finisher, you fall to the ground if you’re in the air, even if you haven’t reached the maximum distance of your jump. If the distance you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright. When attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a Flamboyant Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase the maximum distance to double your Speed, rather than just your Speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.076,r=0.473,b=0.282), with ID 68e0a445-9943-4ca5-b424-ef83908374ad -->

IMPOSSIBLE RIPOSTE FEAT 14
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your ripostes can deflect attacks back at their source. You can use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of “A foe outside of your reach critically fails an attack roll against you” in addition to its usual trigger. When you use Opportune Riposte with this new trigger against a ranged attack, your Strike deflects some of the triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the result of your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage type changes to that of the triggering attack. For instance, if you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a blazing bolt, your Strike would deal fire damage instead of its normal damage type. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.288,r=0.473,b=0.512), with ID 8c01a17a-0965-4479-ba62-a8b65acca1aa -->

SWASHBUCKLER
Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. When you score a critical hit with an agile or finesse melee weapon that has the deadly trait, you double the number of dice from that trait.

Prerequisites precise strike 6d6
You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright. Make a Strike. On a success, you forego your precise strike damage from the finisher.

SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation.

New Familiar Abilities
Item Delivery: If your familiar is adjacent to you, you can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal 2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you’re holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action, then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing creature. It can instead administer the item to the creature if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn’t reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded otherwise. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.166,r=0.515,b=0.356), with ID ae0eff49-fb76-417d-ae46-f83a401cb2fb -->

**Poison Reservoir:** Your familiar has a reservoir for poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent ally’s exposed weapon with a single Interact action. You must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir using two consecutive Interact actions. You must have a homunculus familiar to select this ability. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.357,r=0.515,b=0.448), with ID 1d58e37d-e645-4eee-a780-74a098d295e0 -->

Second Opinion: Your familiar is your academic
confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains
1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only
to Aid you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill
in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to
prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It
automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those
skills or automatically critically succeeds if you’re a master
of the skill in question. Your familiar must have the skilled
ability to select this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.449,r=0.514,b=0.602), with ID 505b8ec9-2ec4-437e-b99d-f21798ba50e9 -->

# SPECIFIC FAMILIARS
Some familiars are more powerful than the usual familiars, and possess unique abilities. Any character can gain a specific familiar so long as they already have a familiar with at least the required number of abilities listed in the specific familiar’s stat block. Such a familiar usually replaces an existing familiar, though in some circumstances (such as for a witch) the familiar may evolve or reveal its true form. In any case, this transition from a normal familiar to a specific familiar requires no downtime and has no cost. Once you’ve selected a specific familiar, you can’t change it <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.766,r=0.513,b=0.940), with ID af5ef082-01d5-4271-8407-a4c30eabefc2 -->

without losing your familiar—this uses the same rules for
gaining a new pet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.173,r=0.902,b=0.203), with ID a1769944-1eca-4391-8a79-778509a18520 -->

A specific familiar has several traits and abilities, as listed
in their stat block. The granted abilities entry lists normal
familiar and master abilities that familiar has. The familiar
also gains unique abilities listed below the granted abilities
entry. Much like a familiar that naturally has a familiar
ability (such as an owl with a fly Speed), you can never
swap out any of these granted or unique abilities. If your
familiar gains more abilities than the required number
of abilities, you can use the remaining abilities to select
additional familiar and master abilities as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.204,r=0.903,b=0.356), with ID e11892c6-377a-4987-9de2-b2d51cf6ceb0 -->

# CHAPTER 3:
## ARCHETYPES

_Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers because of the sentinel archetype? Are you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you’re a medic, tending to the fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.069,r=0.870,b=0.216), with ID dc3c6f2c-02b8-4b1d-9464-c56c09134e6d -->

You gain an archetype by selecting archetype feats instead
of your normal feats. First, find the archetype that best
fits your character concept. Then select that archetype’s
dedication feat, using one of your class feat choices. Once
you’ve taken the dedication feat, you can select any feat
from that archetype, as long as you meet its prerequisites.
Most archetype feats are taken in place of class feats, and
so these are called archetype class feats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.246,r=0.475,b=0.372), with ID 63bb70f2-982e-449b-9b1d-33f839803b42 -->

An archetype feat is subject to any restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you had an ability at 6th level that granted you a bonus class feat, but that class feat had to be 4th level or lower and have the dwarf trait, you could use that class feat to take an archetype class feat, but only one of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.372,r=0.475,b=0.467), with ID e637c111-f09b-4a8c-bbcd-f68c035a3d7e -->

Dedication Details
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents your character’s effort to learn a new set of abilities, making it impossible to split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can’t select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.473,r=0.475,b=0.621), with ID 06b2b4f6-f793-406c-93e9-8e2d37bb5b4a -->

Multiclass Dedications  
Some archetypes in this book have the multiclass trait. These allow you to diversify your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are already a member of that class. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.626,r=0.475,b=0.714), with ID 879356e4-230b-43a3-acc1-7cb27a0ee07e -->

## Additional Feats
Some archetypes include a list of “Additional Feats” that appear in other sources. The list includes each feat’s level, which might be different than normal when gained from the archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype’s dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class’s trait (such as the fighter trait) doesn’t have that class trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.718,r=0.475,b=0.866), with ID 50daf7fa-7e47-4da8-9810-6550904b5144 -->

## Feats that Grant Feats
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you select another feat, such as a class feat of a lower level. You must always meet any prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way. These <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.871,r=0.475,b=0.943), with ID c0aa73c2-4ce6-4b6f-8f3f-d6a3fe1bfcb1 -->

always count as only one feat for the purposes of your
dedication; for example, taking the barbarian archetype’s
Basic Fury feat to gain the Sudden Charge class feat
counts as only one feat, not two. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.483,t=0.247,r=0.866,b=0.313), with ID e911a585-5e0e-48e2-afad-865d928580eb -->

Spellcasting Archetypes  
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character from a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a spellcasting class can. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.320,r=0.867,b=0.418), with ID e8f081de-7c85-4bc4-bfe9-b459c9be87d2 -->

Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast
cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic
spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master
spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the
archetype; for instance, the sorcerer archetype’s master
spellcasting feat is called Master Sorcerer Spellcasting.
All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes
are subject to the restrictions within the archetype. For
instance, the eldritch archer archetype allows you to pick
a spell list when you take its dedication feat. If you pick
arcane spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots
you can use only to cast arcane spells from your eldritch
archer repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with arcane
spells in your sorcerer repertoire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.418,r=0.867,b=0.632), with ID 54850f3a-099f-4b75-8109-13192adfc69b -->

**Basic Spellcasting Feat:** Usually available at 4th level, these feats grant a 1st-rank spell slot. At 6th level, they grant you a 2nd-rank spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “basic spellcasting benefits.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.632,r=0.867,b=0.739), with ID 2ef4fc7f-19ab-4d88-99ac-da909b028ab0 -->

**Expert Spellcasting Feat:** Typically taken at 12th level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack modifier and spell DC and grant you a 4th-rank spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-rank spell slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “expert spellcasting benefits.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.739,r=0.867,b=0.862), with ID 751fc222-ea9e-4a6a-8a25-d8c412ccfaf8 -->

Master Spellcasting Feat: Usually found at 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack modifier
and spell DC and grant you a 7th-rank spell slot. If you
have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from
your repertoire as a signature spell. At 20th level, they <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.862,r=0.867,b=0.942), with ID 086f5fe2-aa4e-476e-99d2-6dcfd392b4c4 -->

KEY TERMS
You'll see these terms within this chapter's archetypes.
   Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.149,t=0.092,r=0.500,b=0.187), with ID 8364e6c3-f259-40b4-aadc-5600456c0e14 -->

**Spellshape:** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use the spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action.

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.152,t=0.327,r=0.502,b=0.463), with ID 8dec60c3-f16c-495a-bad2-958e077add75 -->

Alchemical Archetypes  
Some archetypes give you the ability to use alchemy in a similar manner to an alchemist and say that you get the advanced alchemy benefits or Quick Alchemy benefits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.536,r=0.513,b=0.601), with ID 7de8faf7-5a75-4c53-9612-689d63914059 -->

Advanced Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical
Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it.
In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows you to
create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables
each day during your daily preparations without the normal
cost or time expenditure, as described on page 58. If you
gain advanced alchemy from more than one source, use the
highest number of alchemical consumables per day rather
than adding them together, but you can make items of any
type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy abilities. For
instance, Herbalist Dedication lets you create 4 alchemical
consumables with the healing trait, and Poisoner Dedication
lets you create four alchemical poison consumables. If you
had both feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but
they could be any combination of healing and poison items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.603,r=0.513,b=0.831), with ID 656db621-c275-472b-b0f6-97b5020e9860 -->

Quick Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it. In addition, you gain the Quick Alchemy action (page 59), which lets you create short-lived alchemical consumables with a special action, and you can create a certain number of versatile vials during your daily preparations to fuel Quick Alchemy. Unless otherwise noted, you can’t regain versatile <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.832,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID c6aa2822-8f9d-4659-b7eb-aa92f3151092 -->

vials throughout the day the way alchemists can. The
individual archetype tells you how many versatile vials you
can create each day, and might impose special restrictions or
benefits for how you can use them. If you gain versatile vials
from more than one source, you use the highest number of
vials to determine your maximum rather than adding them
together, but you can use the vials for any Quick Alchemy
option or other use of versatile vials you possess. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.079,r=0.905,b=0.205), with ID 04849985-96ab-43e7-b2e0-6d259498306f -->

Temporary Items  
Several archetypes allow you to prepare temporary items.  
Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these  
temporary items last only a short time before becoming  
useless. Examples include temporary scrolls created by  
the scroll trickster and temporary weapons, armor, or  
adventuring gear created by the scrounger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.215,r=0.904,b=0.325), with ID 593a9187-2a56-40ee-8aff-a3fa3e294b0d -->

Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality
as other items, so they typically can’t be sold. If an ability
doesn’t list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts
until the next time you make your daily preparations. Any
effect created by a temporary item also ends at that time if
it hasn’t already (unless it’s a permanent effect). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.327,r=0.904,b=0.418), with ID 1bece57d-3b41-4ce6-8bbb-35e0dab6782e -->

Special Archetypes  
Some archetype feats have the skill trait, allowing you to take them in place of a skill feat rather than a class feat. A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement of the dedication. Other books contain class archetypes that can modify your class’s abilities as soon as 1st level. You can never have more than one class archetype. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.430,r=0.903,b=0.540), with ID 13bd28ff-d667-4ae7-8473-2fdaed832834 -->

- **Multiclass Alchemist Characters**
- The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype are extremely useful to characters of any class. The following are just some of the possible combinations.
  - • Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect.
  - • Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion’s reaction and _lay on hands_ to go further.
  - • Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don’t work.
  - • Ranger alchemists often focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
  - • Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage.
  - • Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darkvision elixirs to grant vision in darkness can prepare another spell instead of _darkvision_. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.182,r=0.473,b=0.558), with ID c43aa2dc-da39-410f-872e-ed74453b165a -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a humanoid canine creature, dressed in tattered clothing and equipped with various adventuring gear, holding a potion and a jagged dagger.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a bipedal, wolf-like humanoid with pointed ears, a bushy tail, and clawed feet and hands.
  • The creature wears a hooded cloak, patchwork leather clothing, and several belts and pouches.
  • It holds a round flask containing an orange liquid in its left hand and a jagged, hook-like dagger in its right hand.
  • The color palette is dominated by earthy browns, grays, and muted tones, with some metallic and leather textures.
  • The perspective is frontal, showing the full body of the creature in a dynamic, crouched pose.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible fur texture, fabric tears, and accessory details such as a coiled rope, vials, and pouches.
  • No on-image text or UI elements are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature is centered in the composition, occupying most of the frame.
  • The background is plain white, isolating the figure and emphasizing its features and equipment.
  • The left hand (viewer’s right) is extended forward with the potion, while the right hand (viewer’s left) is raised with the dagger.

Analysis :
  • The visual message conveys a fantasy or role-playing game character, likely an alchemist, rogue, or shaman archetype.
  • The combination of animalistic features, worn clothing, and adventuring gear suggests a resourceful, possibly mischievous or cunning character.
  • The dynamic pose and detailed accessories highlight readiness for action or adventure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.471,r=0.872,b=0.944), with ID 704ba434-66e1-42df-b925-ee3e7069fae8 -->

## Multiclass Barbarian Characters
The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters who emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage’s spellcasting restriction. It’s especially good for characters looking to add more damage.
- • Alchemist barbarians can enhance themselves with potent mutagens before releasing their fury.
- • Champion barbarians might enter a zealous rage when their deity is offended and diplomacy is no longer an option. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.151,r=0.518,b=0.326), with ID 61e3bb32-050c-4d20-8278-66703e847670 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a humanoid creature made of twisted vines and branches, holding a massive boulder inscribed with glowing blue runes above its head. The creature has a wooden mask with a distressed expression and is adorned with leafy foliage and a small axe at its side.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a plant-based humanoid figure, constructed from intertwined branches, vines, and leaves.
  • The figure is lifting a large, roughly hewn stone overhead; the stone is covered in glowing blue runic symbols.
  • The creature wears a simple wooden mask with a frowning mouth and two eye holes, conveying an emotional or animated expression.
  • A small axe with a yellow handle is attached to the figure’s side.
  • The background is white, isolating the subject and focusing attention on the character and the boulder.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference, but the proportions suggest the boulder is much larger than the figure’s head and torso.
  • The runes on the boulder are stylized and not from a real-world alphabet.
  • The illustration uses a digital painting style with naturalistic textures for wood, leaves, and stone.
  • Lighting is diffuse, with soft shadows under the boulder and on the figure’s lower limbs.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The boulder is held directly above the figure’s head, with both arms fully extended upward.
  • The figure’s legs are spread apart, bracing for the weight, and its feet are splayed for stability.
  • The axe is strapped to the figure’s right side, partially obscured by foliage.
  • The mask is centrally placed on the “face,” with the foliage forming a collar around the neck area.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of strength and struggle, with the figure’s posture and facial expression emphasizing the effort of lifting the heavy, magical boulder.
  • The glowing runes and fantastical design suggest a magical or mythical context, likely from a fantasy game or story.
  • The composition centers the figure and boulder, drawing the viewer’s eye to the dramatic action and the mystical elements. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.123,t=0.335,r=0.526,b=0.950), with ID 24ee6b38-412b-4166-ad34-85a81f530f20 -->

- • Druid barbarians transform into mighty beasts and monsters before entering a rage.
- • Monk barbarians can use the enhanced emotional state of rage to flow with their stance.
- • Rogue barbarians are ruffians who thrive in a scrap and are happy to let their anger take control.
- • Spellcaster barbarians might wait until they’re out of better options, using rage as a last resort. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.078,r=0.907,b=0.205), with ID 718490ee-6ce6-4300-9c5a-abe90bf9da14 -->

- • Champion investigators can Devise a Strategem to decide the optimal time to switch from defense to offense.
- • Fighter investigators are constantly searching for optimal stratagems in the heat of battle.
- • Ranger investigators can hunt down their prey in the deepest jungle and the busiest street corner.
- • Spellcaster investigators can use magic and practical skills in pursuit of their lead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.123,r=0.517,b=0.389), with ID 4b67480c-abda-480e-9e40-1d6aaff990b7 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-style character illustration depicting a white-haired figure in fur-lined winter clothing, wielding a magical purple rune shield and conjuring fire in one hand, with a warhammer at their side.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a humanoid character in a dynamic, crouched pose, facing slightly to the left.
  • The character wears heavy, fur-trimmed winter gear in brown and grey tones, with boots, gloves, and layered clothing.
  • In the left hand, the character conjures a small flame, suggesting magical or elemental power.
  • The right hand holds a warhammer, and a large, glowing purple magical rune circle with runic symbols is projected in front of the character, indicating spellcasting or magical defense.
  • The background is plain white, isolating the character and magical effects.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators present.
  • The rune circle is semi-transparent, glowing purple, and inscribed with stylized runes and geometric lines.
  • The fire effect is orange and yellow, stylized to appear magical.

  • The warhammer is held in the right hand, angled downward, suggesting readiness for combat.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the character’s dual nature as both a physical combatant (warhammer, sturdy clothing) and a spellcaster (fire conjuring, magical rune shield).
  • The use of glowing magical effects and dynamic pose conveys action, power, and readiness.
  • The fur-lined attire and overall design suggest a cold or arctic environment, possibly indicating the character’s adaptation to harsh climates. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.452,r=0.877,b=0.955), with ID 79327b5e-118a-4901-ab68-975a9e2818ff -->

## Multiclass Swashbuckler Characters
The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charisma-based spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work especially well for characters who already want to incorporate skill-based action and seek out daring deeds to do in the heat of battle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.137,r=0.516,b=0.262), with ID a6eac158-0c64-4bb2-b0c4-b5cfac5e9f0a -->

- • Barbarian swashbucklers love to show off their strength and brutality with devastating finishers.
- • Champion swashbucklers can show off the powers of their deity to inspire awe in potential converts and fear in enemies of the faith.
- • Investigator swashbucklers might love to solve big cases with an audience to show off their prowess.
- • Monk swashbucklers can take full advantage of their perfectly trained bodies to perform impressive feats.
- • Rogue swashbucklers might hide in the shadows before emerging to put on a flashy show.
- • Spellcaster swashbucklers might want to show off their mastery of both martial and magical arts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.143,t=0.263,r=0.516,b=0.480), with ID 96fff534-3813-4e74-9f7a-e94e56d5981c -->

Archaeologist  
Adventurers raid tombs for material gain, but true archaeologists treasure the knowledge attained from such sites. You might accomplish your goals with scholarly learning, by training to overcome the tricks and traps set by ancient peoples and rivals, through magical training, or even with a bit of inexplicable luck. Many archaeologists practice a combination of all these approaches. Regardless of method, all archaeologists possess a deep desire to learn more about sapient history and prehistory. Adventuring through tombs, dodging traps, and studying magic are all means to better understand ancient sites, analyze artifacts, and decipher the meaning of any remains that can be found from previous inhabitants. You decide how you will uncover the secrets of the past and what to do with the answers you find. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.340), with ID 15d89185-6d64-4759-8d11-58d31362b4db -->

# Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield between you and your enemies. You’ve focused your training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself and those around you. Darting around in search of cover isn’t necessary when you carry your cover with you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge that you have your most trusted companion at your side: your shield. This long-lasting fighting style has existed for ages due to its practicality and propensity for survival among its practitioners. While some prefer the nimbleness of a free hand or the power of a larger weapon, a bastion knows that surviving a little bit longer is worth more than a quicker or stronger attack.

  Additional Feats: 6th Shielded Stride (*Player Core* 143); 8th Reflexive Shield (*Player Core* 145), Shield Warden (page 96); 10th Quick Shield Block (page 97); 12th Mirror Shield (*Player Core* 148); 18th Improved Reflexive Shield (*Player Core* 150) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.074,r=0.474,b=0.435), with ID 467eb05f-4aaa-45d8-b5f5-aa3352ba254f -->

NIMBLE SHIELD HAND                FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that’s holding it for other tasks that require the dexterity of a hand. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the Interact action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can’t use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn’t apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.717,r=0.474,b=0.881), with ID 080b8fcd-10ce-4947-83e1-67a3edf7ea4f -->

You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense of your shield. When you Shield Block, you can reduce the damage to yourself by double the shield's Hardness, but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it would have taken (before applying its Hardness).

## Beastmaster Animal Companions
If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules on pages 206–211 of Player Core. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.492,t=0.079,r=0.857,b=0.332), with ID 69a95c2e-6d3d-4d15-8817-597b6e0500b9 -->

This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of any worship. You might offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting to defy the deity’s influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity’s order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these potent gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as long as they’re capable of granting a healing divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.344), with ID 5290f428-6087-425c-8359-11c07f34556a -->

purposes. Despite this possibility, it’s quite uncommon
for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant
the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the
deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift.

you aid the deity who granted you this power, or will

CAVALIER  
You are a skilled and dedicated warrior on the battlefield who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal companion that serves as your mount. You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might wield a banner in the name of an order of which you’re a member, a liege to whom you’ve sworn your service, or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to dinosaurs. What’s important is not the type of mount but the connection between the cavalier and their companion. This bond is their true strength. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.073,r=0.517,b=0.328), with ID ee306cea-19aa-4648-87c6-50f74e60085a -->

## CAVALIER PLEDGES
Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid’s animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier’s Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual (Player Core 390). Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.069,r=0.863,b=0.406), with ID f4372e6a-b8f1-49fb-81eb-0254ea998352 -->

Duelist
All across the world, students in fencing academies practice with their weapons to master one-on-one combat. The libraries of these schools contain troves of information, detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such training classes might duel in formalized settings—and that’s certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there’s no better training ground for duels than the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a flexible, single-handed fighting style is invaluable. You never know when you’ll need an extra hand to shove a foe, haul open a door, or grab valuable loot. You can accomplish such deeds with style and grace. Regardless of your method, fighters such as you are feared across the land. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.075,r=0.471,b=0.341), with ID 500ccf78-3ab1-4943-9903-7e598a69a9b6 -->

# ELDRITCH ARCHER
While many archers see their craft as an art form as much as a means of battle, a small number of archers seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending projectiles zig-zagging unerringly to their targets, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. The imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for their prowess and make valuable members for any party of adventurers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.297), with ID fd5e2fc6-da42-424b-bf66-18b383d05812 -->

While having some spellcasting ability increases
your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you
might learn the secrets of these arts without being
independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the
magic of the bow for its own sake. In fact, many eldritch
archers begin as archers first and spellcasters second.
That is not to say that the occasional spellcaster has not
picked up archery. In fact, many wizards, wise in the art
of war, have studied the bow, particularly to master this
art. Ultimately, what matters is a perfect combination of
martial skill and magical ability; the order you go about
obtaining them matters little. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.095,r=0.906,b=0.279), with ID 3bf116d8-0660-4cc6-bc72-12a672a0d4c4 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of an archer character, accompanied by text describing the "Eldritch Archer Dedication" and "Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting" feats from a tabletop roleplaying game, likely Pathfinder 2e.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid archer in elaborate, fur-trimmed blue and grey armor, holding a large bow with a glowing, magical arrow nocked.

  • The illustration is detailed, with visible textures on the armor, bow, and magical effects.
  • The image is integrated with text describing game mechanics, including prerequisites, effects, and spellcasting rules for the Eldritch Archer archetype.

# FAMILIAR MASTER
From the wise owl perched on the wizard’s shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist’s lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief’s cell, familiars have always served. Yours serves better than most. This is often due to an unusually strong connection or rigorous intentional training. Regardless of the method, the extraordinary qualities of your familiar are undeniable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.234), with ID 8b84cdb2-5b3f-43d9-a8fb-c8f719854dab -->

You and your familiar are a team in and of yourselves. In a tough situation, you know you have each other’s back, and you are nigh inseparable. Some familiar masters, however, choose to keep familiars for only a short period. They will keep their ally for a time, then release them and forge a new bond. They form strong connections quickly and attract new familiars everywhere they go. This behavior is less common but is often done out of a high level of respect for the independence of both the adventurer and the familiar, or a strong connection to the ebb and flow of life and the cycle of change that touches all things. You are among these masters and can decide which practice best suits you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.235,r=0.515,b=0.448), with ID 93b983ab-3368-4622-a06a-81f3777b89a9 -->

You gain a familiar (Player Core 212). If you already have a familiar, you gain the Enhanced Familiar feat (page 153). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.074,r=0.907,b=0.237), with ID 75cda9fe-878a-4a28-a607-ad7d186e4175 -->

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, master in Society
All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they secretly attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.
Once you’ve gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and Deception checks with them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.257,r=0.865,b=0.573), with ID bb38b5a5-e35b-4d0a-913c-ba961fa874d2 -->

CRUDE COMMUNICATION                FEAT 8

ARCHETYPE

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Even if you don’t speak a creature’s language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check for you, with a DC appropriate for the language’s rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you’re legendary in Society, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a Society check; even if you didn’t know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.553,t=0.579,r=0.863,b=0.940), with ID b81cddca-55d4-4850-9892-284b0f5077ab -->

# MARSHAL
Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals’ ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated. Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel, and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies to glory and victory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.389), with ID bfc2b497-d570-49df-95b1-8d61cac6008c -->

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a standing warrior clad in layered armor, including a yellowish surcoat with metallic trim, chainmail, and plate elements.
  • The figure is viewed from a three-quarters perspective, facing right, with the sword angled downward and the left arm raised.
  • The color palette is dominated by muted yellows, browns, and metallic grays, with subtle shading to indicate depth and material texture.
  • The background is plain white, isolating the figure and emphasizing the character design.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The armor features detailed textures, including visible chainmail beneath the surcoat and articulated plate on the shoulders and legs.
  • The sword is partially visible, with a simple crossguard and grip.

While many see marshals as traditionally warriors of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines. Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires. After all, more battles await in the future, and their skills may very well be needed again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.079,r=0.905,b=0.233), with ID 2ba01cd5-3531-4ad2-96a4-a370a2416004 -->

# Martial Artist
You have trained in the martial arts, making your unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor enlightenment, and you don’t view this training as some greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training is focused and practical, and since you have turned every part of your body into a weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.295), with ID 05efee7d-61a9-4785-9ded-c905b4a4ef39 -->

Regardless of your origins, your path is one of iron,
transforming your body into a deadly weapon. The
techniques available are many, but the results are all the
same. Whether you attack with your fist, fang, or foot,
your prowess is undeniable. Many martial artists seek
to master a stance to put form to their flurry of attacks.
Such techniques allow one to channel their strength.
However, some prefer freedom in form and reject stances
altogether. You may find your own style or master one of
the forms used by legendary martial artists. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.296,r=0.515,b=0.449), with ID ddcf1544-9b9f-443b-826c-9dd50d597458 -->

**MEDIC**
You’ve studied countless techniques for providing medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer. While many healers happily practice the art of medicine in the safety and serenity of stationary buildings, few are in more dire need of medicinal aid than adventurers. Such an occupation comes with frequent injuries that need constant attention. Few parties would ever turn down help from a practicing medic. In fact, the need for medicine is so great that many medics started as adventurers and took up medicine as a necessity. While patching up injuries is the most common practice of medics, they are also invaluable for their ability to help fight diseases and ailments inflicted by all kinds of creatures and traps. The adaptability and utility of the medic are undeniable. Whether you studied medicine for most of your life or picked it up on the road, you are who people turn to for aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.073,r=0.516,b=0.358), with ID ca362bd6-f79d-4124-8e5a-c3f28dc3350e -->

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is an anthropomorphic rat standing upright, dressed in a dark brown plague doctor outfit including a wide-brimmed hat, beaked mask, and cloak.

POISONER  
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the insidious power of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes the blood congeal to jelly.

Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration of a seated, muscular figure preparing a purple substance, possibly poison, on an arrow, with a bowl of the same substance in their lap. The character is dressed in rugged, practical clothing and armor, with a bow slung over their back.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a bald, muscular humanoid figure sitting cross-legged on the ground.
  • The figure is wearing a sleeveless, dark green tunic with leather armor, a greenish cloak, and fur-trimmed shorts.
  • The character is holding an arrow in one hand and applying a purple substance to its tip with the other hand.
  • A bowl containing more of the purple substance rests in their lap.
  • A bow is slung over the figure’s back, indicating an archer or ranger archetype.
  • The setting is nondescript, with a white background and no visible environment.
  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and purples.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • Lighting is diffuse and even, with soft shadows and highlights accentuating the figure’s musculature and clothing textures.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible fabric textures, leather straps, and fur trim.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The figure is centrally placed, occupying most of the frame.
  • The bowl and the figure’s hands are in the foreground, drawing attention to the act of preparing the arrow.

Scrounger
You have spent countless hours disassembling and rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving you the skill to create just about anything from the most unlikely materials. While your improvised items don’t last long, they tend to be just what you need in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what’s in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be needed, provided your constant attempts to break down and reassemble everything aren’t a bother. You never know what you may need in the future. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.419), with ID f9d42abf-4a50-459d-8d59-6204994bff4d -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a goblin-like character in a crouched pose, holding a paintbrush and a large, curved blade, wearing makeshift armor and a hood.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a green-skinned, goblin-like humanoid character.
  • The character is crouched low to the ground, barefoot, with one hand holding a large, curved blade and the other holding a paintbrush.
  • The character wears a metal hood and patchwork armor on the shoulders and forearms, with tattered brown shorts.
  • The setting is isolated on a white background, with no visible environment or context.
  • The color palette is dominated by muted greens, browns, and metallic grays, with some rust and wear visible on the armor.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration style is digital, with detailed shading and highlights to suggest texture and material.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character is centrally placed, with limbs splayed to suggest readiness or stealth.
  • The large blade is in the foreground, angled toward the viewer, while the paintbrush is held upright in the background.
  • The armor and hood frame the character’s upper body, drawing attention to the tools in hand.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of agility, resourcefulness, and readiness for action, typical of fantasy goblin or rogue archetypes.
  • The combination of a weapon and a paintbrush suggests a dual role or creative aspect to the character, possibly indicating a trickster or artisan theme.
  • The worn armor and bare feet reinforce the character’s improvisational and rugged nature. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.593,r=0.511,b=0.963), with ID f5c7ace9-5aa2-4930-a66f-e850a93d915f -->

Cobble Together (exploration) You Craft a temporary item (page 174) out of anything, anywhere, with whatever materials happen to be on hand, spending only 10 minutes to perform the initial Crafting check. The temporary item must be one you’ve memorized or have the formula for, and must be common, non-magical, half your level or lower, and must be a weapon, armor, or a non-consumable piece of adventuring gear (non-consumable adventuring gear appears on page 291 of Player Core). Instead of a single item, you can create 10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. You can create only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for example, while you could create a blank journal or one with random pages, you couldn’t use it as a scholarly journal or a religious text. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.079,r=0.906,b=0.295), with ID 3746e203-ddba-4f99-a23e-e564a7269ff8 -->

An item you Cobble Together is a shoddy item, but when creating it you can choose one creature to build it specifically for. That creature doesn’t take the normal penalty for using this shoddy item. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number of hours secretly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.541,t=0.295,r=0.907,b=0.389), with ID 4b9191f5-2c32-4865-a08f-0046e8ee6db5 -->

Sentinel
Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you have made it your business to get the most out of your defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and hopefully your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many grievous injuries and decided enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. While this is less common, it’s not less effective. Few will argue against stronger, heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle knows, it’s always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won’t abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough. You can rely on your armor to see you through whatever tough fights lie ahead, and the odds always seem better when you’re protected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.074,r=0.472,b=0.480), with ID 17bacae9-e4f0-4562-b4d9-6eb17b526c3a -->

# Snarecrafter

You’re able to take ordinary materials and use them to create deadly snares—special traps that you can rig up quickly when the situation demands. While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes realize that you may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage: they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps you’ve deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them, some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap right under their foes’ feet. Others have found they can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a dangerous foe and handy ally. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.404), with ID c8bc76ee-99d1-4f8a-97d5-4f3a0cbb2792 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a small, anthropomorphic lizard-like creature with green, scaly skin and two prominent horns, wearing a brown tunic and holding a metal bucket spilling out several caltrops (spiked metal objects).

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a bipedal, horned, lizard-like creature with green scales and a long, segmented tail.
  • The creature is dressed in a brown tunic with a belt and is holding a metal bucket.
  • Several caltrops are spilling from the bucket onto the ground, and the creature is holding one caltrop in its hand.
  • The background is plain white, isolating the subject with no additional setting or context.
  • The lighting is even and soft, with no strong shadows; the colour palette is dominated by greens and browns.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are present.
  • The illustration is rendered in a semi-realistic, digital painting style.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature is positioned centrally, facing slightly to the left.
  • The bucket is held in the creature’s left hand and tilted downward, causing the caltrops to fall.
  • The tail curves behind and to the right, occupying the lower right of the image.
  • Caltrops are scattered at the creature’s feet and in its hand, drawing attention to these objects.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of mischief or preparation, as the creature appears to be intentionally spilling or handling the caltrops.
  • The focus on the caltrops and the creature’s expression suggests a narrative or character trait, possibly related to trickery or defense.
  • The isolated white background emphasizes the character and its actions without distraction. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.566,r=0.519,b=0.947), with ID 29bdfb4c-4b56-47c4-96e4-6830c04c26c3 -->

You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares. When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of its area, and all its effects apply over the full area. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.566,r=0.905,b=0.725), with ID 3a580292-dcde-45c2-925b-5d57d5607f88 -->

# Talisman Dabbler
The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard, poring over a crumbling book of spells as years pass. But magic is so much more than that—it’s thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You’ve heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master these mystical trinkets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.073,r=0.472,b=0.449), with ID 7ae760eb-2166-4ee4-867d-cd7ef4484140 -->

You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal classroom or been an accumulation of folk magic picked up over time.

Additionally, you carry a vast collection of magical
baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each
day during your daily preparations, you can make two
talismans with an item level no higher than half your
level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman
created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic
the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven't already used it. Any saving throw DC required
by a temporary talisman you create uses the highest of
your class DC, spell DC, or the talisman's DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.601,r=0.471,b=0.756), with ID be566aac-1078-4ee0-b772-dda9ec3322e9 -->

Vigilante
As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of your life a secret. There are various reasons why you might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone in your life that you want to protect from the dangers and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue attention from your community. It could also be that you don’t like attention and wish to retain the ability <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.359), with ID 1d341664-a892-4a38-8ff2-01aab06b7c8b -->

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy character illustration depicting a figure in elaborate red and dark blue armor, holding a sword and wearing a hooded cloak, presented in a dynamic, forward-reaching pose.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a humanoid character in full-body armor, predominantly red with dark blue accents.
  • The character is standing with one arm extended forward, holding a sword, and the other arm slightly back.
  • The armor features angular, layered plates, a high-collared gorget, and a long, tattered cloak.
  • The setting is a plain white background with some text partially visible along the right edge.
  • The color palette is dominated by deep reds, muted blues, and metallic highlights.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with visible textures on the armor and fabric.
  • No on-image UI elements or text directly on the character.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The character occupies the central foreground, with the cloak and limbs extending outward, creating a sense of motion and depth.
  • The sword is pointed toward the viewer, enhancing the dynamic perspective.
  • The composition uses a three-quarters view, with the character’s body turned slightly to the left.

Analysis :
  • The visual message emphasizes the character’s readiness for combat, authority, and possibly a villainous or anti-heroic role, suggested by the dark, dramatic color scheme and aggressive pose.
  • The intricate armor and weaponry indicate a high-status or elite warrior archetype within a fantasy setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.365,r=0.552,b=0.965), with ID 0dc7e15c-d432-4847-aad7-03c2ad792132 -->

Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see
them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are
working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying
to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors.
They could be hunting down a crime lord they have a
personal vendetta against. Maybe they seek to rebalance
the wealth of a nation, stealing from the rich to give to
those in need. You are one such vigilante, living a hidden
life so you can fight in secrecy. What will you do to keep
your secret and continue down your path?

VIGILANTE DEDICATION FEAT 2  
UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION  
Prerequisites trained in Deception  
You have two identities, each with its own name and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people. If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don’t have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.305,r=0.905,b=0.555), with ID cb431b11-2519-4adb-b43d-94c1f809e6f7 -->

Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup, along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don’t reduce the time required to change identities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.556,r=0.904,b=0.647), with ID d10bda48-e3ed-4404-9c88-90a7be781b45 -->

Your two identities are completely distinct. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don’t reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn’t exist. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.576,t=0.647,r=0.904,b=0.800), with ID 1abc47b9-de3b-4b15-bf5d-4e367c6796d0 -->

To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have the vigilante trait. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity may risk exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime to create a new social identity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.800,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 10e9a274-2326-4518-93ef-c714eb549af3 -->

You’ve learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, animal companion or familiar, expert in Deception
When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, pet, or other minion you gained from a class feature or feat. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion’s appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.242,r=0.473,b=0.467), with ID 873f8091-238b-4524-bb7a-c43407eef938 -->

ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of two 10-foot cubes. It’s in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of veil of privacy, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract rank. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you’re an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you’re a master, and 16 cubes if you’re legendary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.471,r=0.474,b=0.712), with ID 1b587513-98ef-4db8-9218-b6ae01c069d9 -->

You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn’t a specific individual—rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, and from a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against the same Deception DC used for Vigilante Dedication.

VIKING
To go “a-viking” is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the “whale-road”) to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.249), with ID 0913226c-12a5-4ca5-9f5c-99f677abc6e4 -->

# Weapon Improviser
As far as you’re concerned, the best weapon to wield is the one that your opponents never see coming. By knowing how to fight effectively with whatever is at hand, you ensure that you’re never caught unarmed, and you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly think they’ve caught you unprepared. Whether you’re smashing someone over the head with a barstool, tossing a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing your foes with a broken bottle, you can find weapons anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a brawl breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons, you don’t need handle them with care as other warriors do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight without feeling any regrets later. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.073,r=0.473,b=0.311), with ID ce67f12d-d3b9-4536-a396-7457913ee11d -->

**GM Advice:** For a GM setting damage, typically a one-handed improvised weapon’s damage is 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8; one that needs two hands is 1d8, 1d10, or occasionally 1d12, and an extremely ineffective one might deal 1 damage. Improvised weapons typically have zero, one, or two traits, and often have the nonlethal trait. Agile improvised weapons usually have a smaller die size. It’s extremely rare for an improvised weapon to deal more than one die of damage, but powerful magical objects might. Improvised weapons should be fun and don’t last long, so feel free to experiment! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.401,r=0.435,b=0.634), with ID 3583d150-0adf-4941-89bf-be5891d42587 -->

Wrestler
Wrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill against powerful foes. Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. Though it appears brutal, wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.515,b=0.188), with ID 2bcb3a27-6124-4136-bcde-bfa70601de73 -->

The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline’s focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent’s hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the gestures for their spells while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their foes and respected by their allies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.188,r=0.514,b=0.372), with ID 68526277-676e-4db8-9a54-780b729cb44c -->

Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of
Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling
techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as
mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially
to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe
that the process of subduing them in this manner creates
a stronger bond between mount and rider. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.372,r=0.514,b=0.479), with ID ebe30a49-5040-4bd6-bd5a-ad877e95f37b -->

Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On
a success, the target lands prone, and on a critical success, the
target lands prone and takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning

Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You squeeze the breath out of your foe. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On a success, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and the target can barely speak until the start of your next turn or until it Escapes, whichever comes first. While it can barely speak, the target can’t vocalize above a hoarse whisper, and it must succeed at a DC 10 flat check or lose any action that requires speech. For an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action, like Casting a Spell with the concentrate and manipulate trait, the target just rolls a single DC 10 flat check, rather than an additional DC 5 flat check for being grabbed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.518,r=0.474,b=0.773), with ID 24a77724-c1f0-42ca-a84f-9771a6fb16f2 -->

Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your foes from easily escaping—with or without magical assistance. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to use a teleportation spell or effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or the spell fails. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to Escape while under the effect of unfettered movement or a similar effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or be forced to roll the Escape attempt normally, rather than automatically succeeding. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.534,r=0.865,b=0.726), with ID 7c74ce8c-3790-41af-9d90-763703f6a208 -->

A HOME IN EVERY PORT                FEAT 11

DOWNTIME   GENERAL

You have a reputation in towns and villages you’ve visited, and residents are always willing to open their doors to you. When in a town or village, during downtime, you can spend 8 hours to locate a resident willing to provide lodging for you and up to six allies for up to 24 hours at no charge. The standard of living within the acquired lodging is comfortable (GM Core 50), and square meals are provided at no cost. After 24 hours, you must pay standard prices for further lodging and meals or use this feat again to find a new resident willing to host you. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.748,r=0.516,b=0.945), with ID d8bc6b58-9b26-4d38-bebf-2d41193e731f -->

ACROBATIC PERFORMER FEAT 1

You're an incredible acrobat, evoking wonder and enrapturing audiences with your prowess. You can roll an Acrobatics check instead of a Performance check when using the Perform action. If you are trained in both Acrobatics and Performance, you gain a +1 circumstances bonus on Acrobatics checks made to Perform. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.749,r=0.907,b=0.883), with ID 4c36ae61-5ecd-4c5f-ab09-194ce3a0f40f -->

You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial stunts. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Maneuver in Flight and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5. If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.076,r=0.473,b=0.252), with ID 26b1c67b-b293-446b-b594-b9eeb444cbac -->

ARMOR ASSIST FEAT 1
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics or Warfare Lore
You are practiced in helping yourself and others don heavy gear.
You can attempt an Athletics or Warfare Lore check with a DC
determined by the GM (usually DC 15 for common armor, DC 20
for uncommon armor, and DC 25 for rare armor) to halve the
time you take to don armor. You can halve an ally’s time to don
armor by working with them to don the armor and succeeding
at an Athletics or Warfare Lore check against the same DC. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.257,r=0.473,b=0.421), with ID e776acdc-7a2c-45de-b65a-4ff6c8196ca9 -->

ARMORED STEALTH FEAT 2
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If you’re a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if you’re legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the noisy trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks, you ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.426,r=0.473,b=0.619), with ID 39a92e16-79e2-47e1-90ef-a7924ca0f862 -->

ASSURED IDENTIFICATION                FEAT 2
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical success (GM Core 306), you simply can’t identify it instead. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.626,r=0.472,b=0.758), with ID 46d82b5c-6259-4dbc-b85a-dce44aae2c89 -->

BACKUP DISGUISE                                            FEAT 2
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception
You have a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise to Impersonate as a 3-action activity. If you are a master in Deception, it is instead a 2-action activity, and if you are legendary in Deception, it is a single action. You can create a new backup disguise by spending the normal amount of time it takes you to Impersonate, but you can have only one backup disguise at a time. Having a backup disguise doesn’t allow you to <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.764,r=0.472,b=0.942), with ID 7e4e8623-f47b-4827-ac3b-fef73a26df8a -->

remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any
more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily
available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready,
it's possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements
of the disguise (see Conceal an Object in the Stealth skill). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.079,r=0.861,b=0.160), with ID fcf251ac-09f3-45a2-beba-0fd2ad553a89 -->

GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Warfare Lore
You are constantly drawing up plans and battle scenarios, assembling strategies and gathered intelligence for later use. When you scout an enemy’s position or receive a detailed report from an ally who scouted the enemy’s position, if you have a clear indication of the number, position, and identities of your potential foes, you can spend 1 minute to come up with a battle plan that takes such potential factors into account and reduces the role luck plays in the equation. Roll a Warfare Lore check. As long as the information was accurate and remains accurate when you roll initiative against those enemies, you can use the Warfare Lore result you previously rolled for your initiative roll; if you do, this is a fortune effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.167,r=0.862,b=0.404), with ID 18d9b625-c037-423e-82ff-3ff05d4a1c62 -->

BIOGRAPHICAL EYE                                            FEAT 7
GENERAL   SECRET   SKILL
Prerequisites master in Society
In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person's origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person's fingernails and determine they're an herbalist, spy a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn't learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.412,r=0.863,b=0.601), with ID bc0ce29e-ec21-4859-9107-21f79ef76d3c -->

AUDITORY  CONCENTRATE  EMOTION  GENERAL  LINGUISTIC  MENTAL  SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target’s Will DC.
Critical Success The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.135,t=0.533,r=0.516,b=0.755), with ID bc497d8a-8e16-4c94-920e-4755c51c343d -->

Success As critical success, but the penalty is –2.
Critical Failure Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.755,r=0.515,b=0.818), with ID 35269003-c598-469e-9b1e-1c329532e093 -->

CONCEALING LEGERDEMAIN                FEAT 1
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won’t
search, you’re skilled at keeping the object on the move so it’s
never where they look. When you Conceal an Object of light

checks and for the DC of an active searcher’s Perception check.
You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use

CONSULT THE SPIRITS FEAT 7
GENERAL SECRET SKILL
Prerequisites master in Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Frequency once per day
You have learned rites or meditations that enable you to perceive minor, invisible spirits within a place. Choose Nature, Occultism, or Religion when you select this feat. Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that form leshies, who are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural features like the location of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of angelic, demonic, or other spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information about sources of powerful life energy or energy from the Void; sacred or profane influences; or the presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.704,r=0.906,b=0.941), with ID d0fe8466-7936-4235-aacc-1c9180ca9b16 -->

Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to Recall Knowledge
with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a
very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might
encounter in the area). If you’re legendary in the chosen skill, you
can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once per day, but
you can’t use it again on any area that overlaps a previous area.
**Critical Success** The spirits reveal themselves to you and
have a helpful attitude toward you. Only you can perceive
these spirits. They answer three simple questions about
the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the
skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact.
Their answers are almost always a single word, and their
knowledge is limited to within their area of interest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.127,r=0.473,b=0.326), with ID 5501bbaa-38b1-4bac-8974-258e63472410 -->

Failure You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.

a different skill in which you have the master proficiency
rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per day (or
once per hour, if you're legendary). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.433,r=0.472,b=0.497), with ID 63715c9e-d186-478d-9165-0da046c0234d -->

CRAFTER'S APPRAISAL FEAT 1

GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to Impersonate a typical worshipper of another faith or to Lie specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.627,r=0.471,b=0.787), with ID 59979aaf-26c6-411f-bbec-41672b8dfe73 -->

ATTACK   GENERAL   MANIPULATE   SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
Requirements You have a hand free and are within melee reach of an opponent.
You hook a foe’s bootlaces together, pull their hat over their eyes, loosen their belt, or otherwise confound their mobility through an underhanded tactic.

DISCREET INQUIRY FEAT 2
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception or Diplomacy
You are subtle in your efforts to learn the things you need to know. When Gathering Information, you can hide the true subject of your inquiry among other topics of little interest to you without increasing the difficulty of the check or taking more time to Gather Information. Anyone trying to Gather Information to determine if someone else was asking around about the topic in question must exceed your Deception DC or the normal DC to Gather Information about your inquiries, whichever is higher, or else they don’t learn of your efforts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.168,r=0.862,b=0.357), with ID 8a02a96d-5a36-49b7-b49b-3f7bbd35aee8 -->

DISTRACTING PERFORMANCE ◆                FEAT 2
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Performance
Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your
allies to Sneak away with ease. You Create a Diversion, except
you roll a Performance check instead of Deception, and the
benefits of successful checks apply to an ally of your choice
instead of you. The effects of a success last until the end of
that ally’s turn, and can end early based on the ally’s actions.
You don’t need to be observing your ally or know where they
are, but you need to know they’re present to choose them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.367,r=0.862,b=0.541), with ID 09514fc4-a1f2-4d97-a892-e0caf19ac4fa -->

You utter a litany of dreadful names, prophecies, and descriptions of realms beyond mortal comprehension, drawn from your study of forbidden tomes and scrolls. Even those who don't understand your language are unsettled by these dire secrets. Attempt an Occultism check and compare the result to the Will DC of an enemy within 30 feet, or to the Will DCs of any number of enemies within 30 feet if you are legendary in Occultism.

ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDE                FEAT 7
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites master in Survival
You can rapidly adapt to climates and help others do the same. After an hour in an environment, you and up to five allies can treat the natural temperature effects of an environment (GM Core 95) as one step less severe (treat extreme cold as severe cold or extreme heat as severe heat, for instance). This reduction in severity is cumulative with any equipment (such as cold-weather gear) or spells (such as environmental endurance). If you’re legendary in Survival, you may protect yourself and up to five allies, and you treat temperature effects as two steps less severe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.167,r=0.515,b=0.359), with ID b22ff501-f6a8-428f-a1b0-e7a721ec9df8 -->

You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener’s mind to whirl. Attempt a Diplomacy check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM’s discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.

Prerequisites expert in Religion, follower of a specific religion
Your knowledge of the tenets of your faith gives you insight into the best ways to get others of your faith to help you or to follow your directions. When you Request something of or Coerce members of your own faith, you can attempt a Religion check instead of Diplomacy or Intimidation, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.

EXPRESS RIDER FEAT 1

EXPLORATION GENERAL SKILL

Prerequisites trained in Nature
You can encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel Speed (Player Core 438) for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to Command an Animal to increase your mount’s travel Speed.

your mount’s travel Speed by half. This has no effect on your

GENERAL   SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You’ve learned to quickly estimate the number of items in a group with relative accuracy at only a glance. You immediately learn the number of visually similar items in a group you can see, rounded to the first digit in the total number. For example, you could look at a case of potion vials and learn that it held about 30 vials, but you wouldn’t know that it was exactly 33 vials, how many different types of potions there were, or how many of which type. Similarly, you could look at a pile of 2,805 coins and know that there were about 3,000 coins in all. You can use this ability only on items that can typically be counted, so you can’t use it on grains of sand or stars in the sky, for example. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.152,r=0.904,b=0.371), with ID d7536959-e95c-4611-9b55-046025564a25 -->

If you count a specific number of items possessed by an enemy, such as the number of coins or pieces of equipment they're carrying, you can use this information the next time you Feint or Create a Diversion against that target within 1 minute.

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy or Society
You can track down targets with the help of locals. You can use Diplomacy or Society, whichever you’re trained in, to Track creatures in settlements.

You understand principles of forensic medicine, making you better at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury. You can perform a forensic examination on a body, as described under Recall Knowledge in the Medicine skill, in half the normal amount of time (to a minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check, you can attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to follow up on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus. This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon used or an additional Medicine check to identify a specific disease. If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you examined, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.659,r=0.904,b=0.907), with ID a4efe0bc-ab6b-44b8-809f-7038d50aa2d3 -->

  • The knight is seated on a barrel, resting their chin on their hand, and appears to be observing the goblin's work.  
  • The setting is a dimly lit tent or workshop, with shelves and barrels in the background, and green slime dripping from a container in the foreground.  
  • The color palette is dominated by dark greens, browns, and metallic silvers, with highlights of red and green.

Technical Details :  
  • The image is a digital illustration with a fantasy theme.  
  • There is a label in the bottom right corner reading "IMPROVISED REPAIR".  
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.  
  • The shield has a prominent red symbol and green slime, suggesting a magical or alchemical repair.

GLEAN CONTENTS FEAT 1
GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging the seal. You can attempt Society checks to Decipher Writing on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or reversed from your perspective, and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check when doing so. You can also use this feat to decipher sealed letters, adding the manipulate trait to your attempt to Decipher Writing. This doesn’t prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts; you might need to attempt Deception or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed. In either use of this feat, the recipient is made aware of your efforts on a critical failure (for instance, you might be caught rubbernecking or you might disturb the papers in a way their owner notices). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.534,r=0.472,b=0.802), with ID 3e084d0d-0d4e-4466-bf14-a37b60f30219 -->

IMPROVISED REPAIR ▶▶▶                FEAT 3

GENERAL
You can hastily patch damaged equipment together, but the temporary fix lacks the full care required for lasting repairs. You patch together a broken item possessed by you or an adjacent willing creature. Until the item takes damage again, it still functions as a shoddy item of its type (Player Core 270). If it’s a magic item or another item with activations, it can’t be activated while patched together, but can be used for normal functions (such as Striking with a weapon or using Shield Block with a shield). This activity restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.580,r=0.863,b=0.802), with ID ee599c3a-3965-49e3-9c85-825172a53394 -->

INFLUENCE NATURE FEAT 7

DOWNTIME  GENERAL  SKILL
Prerequisites master in Nature
With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days to come. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a day or two of downtime). While you can’t directly control how you’ve influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching. If you’re legendary in Nature, you can elicit these same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.073,r=0.516,b=0.282), with ID 8f33e9e5-0711-4abc-9f59-3de56d09e79f -->

When your allies attempt to Climb a route you set using the Follow the Expert exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their checks to Climb, you can attempt an Athletics check against the same DC. If you succeed, your ally only fails instead of critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the consequences of the critical failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.627,r=0.515,b=0.802), with ID b1079094-eb77-4ae3-a11b-ac24cf69c808 -->

You know the right people who can get things done for you in certain circles. Once per week, when you’re in an area that has an established group of influential nobles, mercantile elites, or the like (if you have Courtly Graces), or a network of unsavory characters such as a thieves’ guild (if you have Streetwise), you can use Society to Request a favor or aid from those people as if they were friendly to you. Your request must make sense for the type of people you contact. For instance, a member of the royal court could secure you a proper invitation to a fancy ball, while a local burglar could point out a way to stealthily infiltrate that same party. If you critically succeed this check, your connection gives a piece of helpful advice or lets you in on a small secret, granting you or a member of your party a +2 circumstance bonus to the first skill check you attempt when acting on the favor. If you critically fail this check, you might have to perform some service for your connection to get back in their good graces, as determined by the GM. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.152,r=0.905,b=0.480), with ID 7ce48181-942b-4265-9099-376ce264e19f -->

ROLLING LANDING FEAT 2

GENERAL  SKILL

Prerequisites Cat Fall
You land with quick rolls that help you keep your momentum.

your reach. Until the end of your next turn, it becomes holy water or unholy water. You can choose holy water if your deity allows holy sanctification, unholy water if your deity allows unholy sanctification, or either if your deity allows both sanctifications.

SLIPPERY PREY

FEAT 2

GENERAL  SKILL

Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics or Athletics
You’re able to escape bonds more easily than others. When you attempt to Escape using Acrobatics or Athletics, you reduce the multiple attack penalty for repeated attempts to –4 and –8 if you’re trained in the skill. The penalty becomes –3 and –6 if you’re a master in the appropriate skill. If you’re legendary in the skill, you don’t take penalties for multiple Escape attempts in the same turn. Regardless of your training, your attempts to Escape still have the attack trait and incur a multiple attack penalty with other actions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.072,r=0.515,b=0.252), with ID c0bfea5a-1b2b-4997-ac52-426c986cc967 -->

UNCOMMON  GENERAL  SECRET  SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception
You spread rumors, which may or may not be true, about a specific subject. If the subject of your rumor is not currently the subject of any contradictory rumors, this takes as long as it would normally take you to Gather Information (typically 2 hours), at the end of which the GM rolls a secret Deception check against a DC they set to see how well you spread the rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the subject, it takes less time to spread, and if you are attempting to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor, it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor is. For example, it might be harder to sow a rumor that the beloved, generous mayor is the head of a cult of murderous demon worshippers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.366,r=0.515,b=0.632), with ID 6b66351f-57fb-4856-ad9c-7e900bd482f6 -->

Critical Success Your rumor spreads like wildfire. Anyone who succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific subject learns your rumor in preference to other rumors about the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 month. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks in an appropriate situation when you invoke your rumor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.632,r=0.514,b=0.725), with ID d34dc51f-a4c4-461a-8878-86c45a722967 -->

Success You successfully spread the rumor. Anyone who succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific subject adds your rumor to the list of rumors they could learn about the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 week.

SUPERTASTER FEAT 7

GENERAL
Prerequisites master in Perception
You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage, you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check against a DC determined by the poison’s level; if the food or drink is poisoned, on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used. If you successfully detect that the food or drink was poisoned, you can spit out the food or drink in time to not be exposed to that instance of the poison (unless you resume eating or drinking the poisoned food or beverage). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.075,r=0.905,b=0.326), with ID 9488b7f0-9a99-4012-8c36-f7f6f07e9b0e -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration showing two armored characters running across the surface of a river in a lush, green landscape, with the text "WATER SPRINT" in the lower right corner.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a person in ornate, dark armor sprinting energetically across the surface of a river, with water splashing beneath their feet.
  • A second character, also armored but in lighter colors, is further back on the river, also running or preparing to run on the water.
  • The setting is a bright, verdant landscape with dense green foliage, trees, and distant misty mountains.
  • The perspective is dynamic, with the foreground character large and in motion, and the background character smaller, emphasizing depth and action.
  • The color palette is dominated by greens, blues, and earth tones, with bright natural lighting.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The text "WATER SPRINT" appears in a brown, stylized label at the bottom right.
  • The illustration style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and fantasy armor design.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The foreground character is positioned left of center, running toward the viewer.
  • The background character is near the center, further up the river, facing forward.
  • The river runs diagonally from the lower left to the upper right, with rocks and foliage on the right bank.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of speed, agility, and supernatural ability, as the characters are running on water.
  • The composition draws the viewer’s eye from the foreground character to the background, emphasizing pursuit or a race.
  • The "WATER SPRINT" label suggests a special ability or action, likely from a fantasy game or story context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.003,t=0.060,r=0.876,b=0.520), with ID b079732b-a0fd-4b97-af18-a2c8366447ae -->

# Your Spellcasting Style
If you’re playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider your personal spellcasting style. Casters of different traditions usually have the biggest gulf between them in how they cast spells, but there’s also differentiation between—and within—classes! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.442,r=0.473,b=0.544), with ID 0eda96db-5341-476b-bd7b-971f66c570bf -->

Preparing your Spells  
If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you do so. Typically, arcane spellcasters consult their books, self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters pray to fill their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult casters attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while referencing occult texts; and primal casters might seek natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a grove or underground cavern. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.550,r=0.473,b=0.693), with ID 41a45b3a-4630-46cb-92b3-c5d50379025d -->

Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend
to wake up with their magical reserves restored. This
might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a teeming thrum
throughout the body, or a sense of impending dread or awe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.694,r=0.473,b=0.758), with ID 471fa341-4ba9-4aa7-824e-84545e81bc1a -->

**Casting your Spells**  
For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful process. For another, it’s a moment of triumph as they outsmart their enemy with just the right trick. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.765,r=0.472,b=0.831), with ID 5997497c-68b1-4a06-b871-09d8f6901213 -->

As mentioned on page 299 of *Player Core*, the manifestation of your magic might produce different sensory effects. You should also think about the nature of the gestures and vocal incantations you use to cast that spell. Do you chant with a different timbre than your normal speaking voice? Does this voice resemble that of your deity or some other supernatural being? When you <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.832,r=0.473,b=0.942), with ID 5539d5e9-b72a-45ed-ba09-5236eb2ab9ef -->

SPELL TRAITS
Several sections within the full rules for casting spells in Player Core cover how spell traits function, including traits like morph and subtle. Spell traits usually apply only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on how these traits work with spells.

Spells with the **concentrate** trait require you to focus on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes), you need to maintain that concentration and can't perform other actions. If your concentration is broken (such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted.

Spells with the **manipulate** trait require you to physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the possibility of disrupting your spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.228,r=0.861,b=0.569), with ID 9b532745-a078-4241-aeed-d4983563c500 -->

gesture, what does it look like? Are they abstract motions
that correspond to different facets of the magic? Perhaps
you always end your incantations with a firm, direct gesture,
like pointing your finger or raising a fist. The particulars of
spellcasting are abstracted, so you can customize each facet
for your character. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.585,r=0.864,b=0.680), with ID 970469b9-2e9b-49a4-b31e-e7a04fc19e75 -->

Refocusing  
Your class briefly describes what you need to do to Refocus, such as meditating for the monk. Start out with some idea of what this looks like for you and refine it during play. What you need to do to Refocus is broadly defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense in the story. One sorcerer might absentmindedly twirl a shiny dragon scale—a remnant of a draconic ancestor—in their hand with their familiar, while another might contemplate the flow of a nearby river to remind themself of the power of water. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.688,r=0.864,b=0.865), with ID 53d43dfb-faf6-44e6-a50d-d32401112d72 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing a chaotic tavern scene where a spellcaster is animating objects to attack a group of monstrous intruders.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a dynamic confrontation inside a medieval-style tavern.
  • Foreground: A spellcaster with wild, light-colored hair and a red headband, holding a staff with a star-shaped top, is casting a spell.
  • Animated objects (food, plates, a chair, a squirrel) are flying through the air toward three wolf-like humanoid monsters entering through a broken door.
  • The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source coming from the open doorway, casting shadows and highlighting the chaos.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm browns and golds, with splashes of red and blue.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with motion blur and dynamic poses emphasizing action.
  • The only visible text is “ANIMATED ASSAULT” in a label at the bottom left and “Pathfinder Player Core 2” at the top.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The spellcaster is positioned in the right foreground, facing the intruders.
  • The animated objects are mid-flight, forming a diagonal line from the spellcaster toward the monsters.
  • The monsters are in the midground, framed by the open doorway, with the tavern interior and other patrons in the background.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the spellcaster and monsters occupying opposing thirds of the image.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of urgent magical defense, with the spellcaster using animated objects to repel the invading monsters.
  • The chaotic motion and scattered objects emphasize the suddenness and violence of the assault.
  • The use of lighting and perspective draws the viewer’s eye from the spellcaster to the monsters, highlighting the conflict. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.009,t=0.007,r=0.989,b=0.523), with ID 183528c7-1986-489d-b623-8e90d73c5cab -->

You tap into the target’s senses, allowing you to sense whatever it senses for the spell’s duration. If the target wishes to prevent you from doing so, it can attempt a Will save, negating the spell on a success, but most animals don’t bother to do so. While tapping into the target’s senses, you can’t use your own body’s senses, but you can change back and forth from your body’s senses to the target’s senses using a Sustain action. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.577,r=0.516,b=0.788), with ID f20e8ccb-c31b-405b-aa15-21a44b117cca -->

You tap into the target’s inner being and curse it to become a bestial version of itself. The effect is based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.077,r=0.472,b=0.125), with ID 6bc3ad48-e0d3-4ae4-8d4d-f9b61ecd22ad -->

**Success** The target’s body gains minor bestial features. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be clumsy 1 for 1 round. When it recovers from the clumsy condition, its features revert to normal, and the spell ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.125,r=0.472,b=0.189), with ID 9cb64dbb-a27c-4ec1-acbf-f3d18a5a5be2 -->

Failure The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour. The target becomes clumsy 1 and gains weakness 1 to silver. It gains a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws Strike (your choice) that uses the target's unarmed Strike statistics except that the damage type changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate. Whenever the target attempts to use any manipulate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.479,r=0.472,b=0.525), with ID 41477cab-0a6e-49e5-9b97-0e55cd439ab8 -->

You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself into its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically triggers it.

The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends.

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration depicting a dramatic battle scene between a humanoid bird mage and a giant tentacled creature, with magical and explosive effects.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a humanoid bird character (possibly a wizard or mage) in ornate blue robes, standing on a broken wooden structure in the foreground.
  • The bird mage is casting a spell, with one hand glowing blue and magical energy swirling around it.
  • In the midground, a glowing blue skeletal figure stands facing a massive explosion of orange and yellow fire.
  • The background features a gigantic, menacing cephalopod-like creature with red glowing eyes and numerous tentacles, partially obscured by the explosion.
  • The setting is a desolate, rocky landscape with debris and ruins, under a stormy sky.
  • The color palette is dominated by fiery oranges, cool blues, and muted earth tones, creating a high-contrast, dynamic composition.
  • Lighting is dramatic, with the explosion providing a strong light source that illuminates the scene and casts deep shadows.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation present.
  • The only visible text is “FINAL SACRIFICE” in a gold-bordered label at the bottom right, likely the title of the artwork or scene.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The bird mage is positioned on the right, elevated above the ground, suggesting a commanding or heroic stance.
  • The skeletal figure is centrally placed, directly in front of the explosion and facing the giant creature, possibly indicating a confrontation or act of sacrifice.
  • The giant creature occupies the left and background, looming over the other figures and partially shrouded by the explosion.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the explosion and bird mage drawing the viewer’s eye.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a climactic moment of magical combat or ritual, with the title “FINAL SACRIFICE” suggesting a pivotal or selfless act.
  • The juxtaposition of the bird mage’s calm, controlled spellcasting and the chaotic explosion highlights the tension and stakes of the scene.
  • The skeletal figure’s ethereal glow and central placement imply it is the focus of the sacrifice or spell.
  • The overall mood is intense and epic, with visual cues emphasizing heroism, danger, and supernatural forces. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.061,r=0.876,b=0.522), with ID 60aa3286-7320-4788-b849-484cb766ae14 -->

The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you Cast a Spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as see the unseen, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target’s senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target’s growls or squawks. You can use Command an Animal on the target as part of Sustaining this spell.

This spell compels local spirits to reenact a violent event of the recent past that you’re aware of and name as you Cast the Spell. You take the role of the primary victim. The reenactment plays out the final 9 minutes leading up to the death or injury of the victim and the minute after. The spirits don’t change form, so this doesn’t help determine perpetrators by their looks.

You make the object invisible. This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them instead if they succeed. If the item is used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed. Making a weapon invisible typically doesn’t give any advantage to the attack, except that an invisible thrown weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker’s hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.

• Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it’s attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save and is off-guard for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.
• The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails.

Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Two human figures in the foreground, one with an outstretched arm casting magic at a large, multi-tiered, domed mansion.
  • Setting: Open, rocky landscape under a vivid blue sky with white clouds.
  • Perspective: Low angle, with the viewer positioned behind and slightly below the two figures, looking up at the mansion.
  • Composition: The mansion dominates the left half of the image, dissolving into pink sparkles; the two figures are on the right, with flowing garments and dynamic poses.
  • Lighting: Bright daylight, strong shadows, vibrant colors (reds, golds, blues, pinks).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references.
  • On-image text: “RESPLENDENT MANSION” in a gold-bordered label at the bottom right.
  • No visible UI elements or digital overlays.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: Two figures, one actively casting a spell, the other observing.

You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer.

MANIPULATE  TELEPORTATION

Traditions arcane, divine, occult  
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 willing creature  
You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target’s hand if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don’t. The target knows what object you’re attempting to send them. If the target is unconscious or refuses to accept your gift, or if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.673,r=0.862,b=0.846), with ID 8aec6196-6b57-4b07-bc06-4e9f3193fe78 -->

This spell allows you to change between three versions of yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother (adult), or a matriarch (elderly). Choose one when you Cast the Spell. While the spell lasts, you can change the age to any of the three or to your natural age by Sustaining the spell. Your form always looks like you regardless of the age, and creatures who know you still recognize you and can tell your age is different. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.074,r=0.515,b=0.279), with ID ab17c34b-e4c9-42a3-9404-da3f5ee43b05 -->

*Threefold aspect* alters your physical appearance and personality to present an authentic version of yourself at various ages.

Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn’t get a chance to notice that you aren’t at your true age. You can Dismiss this spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.280,r=0.515,b=0.418), with ID a842024b-ddc5-46de-9ae3-a7a9e9556a70 -->

A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save.

An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell’s area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of your choice, such as fiendish flies or animated saw blades.

illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage
from the illusion thereafter.

VOMIT SWARM  SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE  MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Area 30-foot cone
Defense basic Reflex
You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn’t change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

CONCENTRATE  MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Range 60 feet
Duration 1 minute
You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to 30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section has AC 10 and 75 Hit Points. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall can’t be Repaired but can be healed by vitality, and healing spells and abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.444,r=0.904,b=0.632), with ID 3936cf40-b020-485f-955d-46029e4e8af5 -->

- • Mouths The wall has countless toothy mouths along its surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack modifier for these Strikes and dealing 2d6 piercing damage. The mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is alive, it can recover Hit Points from a healing potion, but it can't benefit from any effect that would give it the ability to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can affect the wall.
- • Eyes The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall's line of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don't have line of effect through the wall.
- • Arms The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a Reflex save. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.634,r=0.905,b=0.935), with ID 4d1761c5-30f5-445c-881a-3c0737101ed8 -->

You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast this Spell, choose a destination; you receive an inspired route to that destination, allowing you and allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don’t deviate from the inspired route. This doesn’t have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.242,r=0.474,b=0.451), with ID ed68516d-2afa-4a8a-85c2-c71caa8f6232 -->

WEAPON OF JUDGMENT  ▶▶                SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE  MANIPULATE  SANCTIFIED  SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Requirements You have a deity.
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
An immense weapon of spiritual energy appears, hovering in the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity’s favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast this spell. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.457,r=0.473,b=0.617), with ID 00c1d06e-740d-4605-a994-1f830824e3db -->

If you name “war,” mentally choose one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target’s turns, if the target didn’t use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.617,r=0.472,b=0.694), with ID 46c50666-f72a-4235-8ec8-960cfb885d8b -->

If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of the chosen allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.694,r=0.472,b=0.786), with ID 8d37cd67-6e10-4249-a062-af7656c55b41 -->

Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals 4d10 damage. The damage type is the same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target’s turn, but its penalty is separate from yours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.786,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID cd4f9774-2aa5-4596-bff0-754c01f1247b -->

A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons don’t apply to this weapon.
**Heightened (10th)** The damage increases by 1d10. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.079,r=0.862,b=0.175), with ID 1059c03c-17e4-4894-9334-bd0eac7fbe25 -->

You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures’ movement. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain.

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration from the "Pathfinder Player Core 2" book, showing a dramatic scene where an armored character uses a glowing healing ability on a wounded companion in a forested setting.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two characters are central: one in ornate plate armor with a red cape and a large sword on their back, kneeling beside another character in leather and fur armor who is wounded and clutching their side.
  • The armored character is channeling a golden, glowing energy from their hand into the wound of the injured character, suggesting a magical healing act.
  • The background is a dense, autumnal forest with warm, golden and orange hues, and dappled sunlight filtering through the trees.
  • The composition is dynamic, with the healer leaning forward and the wounded character partially reclined, emphasizing urgency and care.
  • The text "LAY ON HANDS" appears in a decorative label at the bottom left, indicating the name of the depicted ability.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with realistic armor textures, foliage, and magical effects.
  • The top of the image includes the "Pathfinder Player Core 2" branding in gold and green.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The armored healer is positioned on the left, dominating the foreground, while the wounded character is on the right, partially in the background.
  • The glowing healing effect is the focal point, drawing the viewer’s eye to the interaction between the two characters.
  • The sword and cape create diagonal lines that add movement and depth to the scene.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates the theme of heroism, compassion, and magical healing in a fantasy role-playing context.
  • The use of warm colors and light effects enhances the sense of hope and recovery.
  • The "Lay on Hands" label directly ties the scene to a specific in-game ability, reinforcing the connection between narrative art and game mechanics. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.006,r=0.993,b=0.521), with ID 2325a8a6-6967-4e26-8381-97050cd29453 -->

With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to delay affliction for 1 day. You don’t need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn’t delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

Heightened (+1) The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points, and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.166,r=0.474,b=0.404), with ID 20bbd67d-0627-4a9a-b184-2ccdd3135f7e -->

You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore 6d8 Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form’s healing for 1 minute. This is a vitality healing effect. You can’t heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 vitality damage, and it doesn’t become temporarily immune. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.525,r=0.474,b=0.678), with ID a9ae9118-e6b8-4c13-a213-7e120f5786fe -->

Duration see text  
You project the targets’ spiritual essences into the Astral Plane, leaving their inanimate physical forms behind. These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.557,r=0.513,b=0.708), with ID a5c0805e-d0b3-40f7-a580-4d334279079f -->

A target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they’re carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to Dismiss their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets’ astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets’ astral forms vanish. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.709,r=0.513,b=0.939), with ID 26fcf4ee-a1a6-4500-9915-eb1a113eda19 -->

A target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are
linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the
Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and
safety line; if severed, the target’s astral and physical forms are
both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external
force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target’s physical or
astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned
to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain, the silver
cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain
requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as
the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a
success, it becomes clumsy 2, drained 2, doomed 2, and enfeebled
2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by
any means until the week has passed. A target’s physical body
remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but
if it’s destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.143,r=0.904,b=0.387), with ID 900b51c4-cb9e-49df-9832-e2b9549a5876 -->

This ritual only projects a portion of the targets’ consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane (to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as *interplanar teleport*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.387,r=0.904,b=0.448), with ID 88ce53a0-292e-4f11-adb6-cdc5c9c4e333 -->

**Critical Success** All targets are able to navigate independently in the Astral Plane. Each target's silver cord is stronger than usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to its Fortitude save to avoid dying if its astral form dies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.449,r=0.904,b=0.510), with ID 3fead78a-8c8a-4b60-b28e-4b0f94d64676 -->

Range 10 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature up to 20th level  
You collect hair, nail clippings, and samples of skin and blood from the target, who must be present throughout the ritual and can be one of the casters. You then use those samples to grow a duplicate of the target’s physical form that will house the target’s soul upon death. This duplicate is physically identical to the original creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.709,r=0.903,b=0.815), with ID 7912e327-fe5d-4146-985f-16ccece7d3fe -->

In order to perform the ritual, you need an expanded alchemist’s lab (*Player Core* 287) or a superior set of equipment. Once the ritual is successfully completed, the duplicate grows within the laboratory equipment for 2d4 months. Though direct involvement isn’t required during this period of growth, you must prevent any interference or interruption, or the ritual fails. When the duplicate is complete, the original creature’s soul enters it as soon as their original body dies, or immediately if the creature <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.817,r=0.903,b=0.939), with ID 73602c26-d192-4dee-94ca-56e6395e4fa3 -->

Summary : This image displays a large, bold numeral "5" centered on a textured, tan background.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is the number "5" in a thick, dark brown font with a light outline.
  • The background is a mottled, tan or light brown color, resembling parchment or sand.
  • The number is centered and dominates the composition.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or additional UI elements are present.
  • The "5" is rendered in a sans-serif, italicized style with a shadow or outline effect.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The number "5" is centrally placed, with ample space around it.
  • No other objects or text are visible in the image.

Analysis :
  • The image is likely intended to highlight or emphasize the number "5", possibly as part of a countdown, ranking, or instructional sequence. The bold design and central placement draw immediate attention to the numeral. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.880,t=0.007,r=0.997,b=0.060), with ID 5fa800df-7f68-4a2d-bf14-6d6b966c1a3c -->

died during the intervening months, as long as the soul is free
and willing. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has
come or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, the
duplicate remains empty until the impediment is removed. While
unoccupied, the inert duplicate must be preserved in suitable
alchemical equipment to prevent it from rotting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.077,r=0.472,b=0.173), with ID b03cf270-791c-4f70-9406-9f9cdacfac7f -->

Critical Success The cloning process is successful. When the
soul occupies the completed clone, it is clumsy 1, drained 1,
doomed 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week; these conditions can't be
removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.
Success As critical success, but each condition value is 2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.173,r=0.473,b=0.255), with ID a19fa217-1ef6-4a77-801d-66d148dca30a -->

Critical Failure The clone appears to be successful, but something went horribly wrong. Once it grows to its full size, it can't hold the target's soul and instead houses a malevolent intelligence or an invasive creature (such as a powerful demon). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.257,r=0.472,b=0.328), with ID 32e1565f-6e77-4862-bc91-ffb1f8f0f579 -->

Duration unlimited
You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the target settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell of the structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the ritual is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade, you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with marching band). You’re unable to alter the programs after you create the facade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.464,r=0.472,b=0.693), with ID 1dd40853-cff1-4341-9aa4-52135599360a -->

You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects as a 3rd-rank illusory disguise. If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.694,r=0.470,b=0.785), with ID dac94807-2353-4bf3-827d-1cf7dacf7de7 -->

A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade, such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an illusory river of lava wouldn’t cause damage, nor could thorns on an illusory rose bush prick someone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.786,r=0.470,b=0.892), with ID f3e4bba8-8421-446d-af0e-c27f6f78a454 -->

**Critical Success** You create the facade as described, and you can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to reprogram them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.893,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 640a006f-ae10-4b43-b226-4b8d13275da3 -->

Success You create the facade as described.
Failure Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned, such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons. These effects fade after 1 month. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.079,r=0.863,b=0.187), with ID 902030ab-31db-4ad6-8d7e-774c1fb3bfbb -->

You craft a large quantity of restorative drink, such as an invigorating tea, a refreshing ale, or a stimulative alchemical tonic. The ritual speeds along any natural processes to make the brew, such as fermenting fruit to make a wine. At the conclusion of the first 3 hours of the ritual, you produce enough brew for up to 10 people to drink, any of whom can be the secondary caster of the ritual. The brew must then be consumed over the next hour. There is no danger of the drinkers becoming drunk if the brew is alcoholic. Once that hour is completed, you and the secondary caster attempt your checks as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.339,r=0.860,b=0.494), with ID adb2fde5-d6aa-454a-9e42-f62b63e976a1 -->

Critical Success The brew is delicious and revitalizing. It casts a 4th-rank cleanse affliction, a 4th-rank clear mind, and a 4th-rank sound body on each drinker for each relevant affliction or condition, using your modifier for the primary skill check as the counteract modifier. Each drinker also gains 20 temporary Hit Points that last 12 hours and a +2 status bonus to saves against diseases and poisons for the next 12 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.495,r=0.861,b=0.601), with ID e0453fbd-7e49-4a81-b4fc-179af19d7910 -->

Success As critical success, except drinkers gain only 10 temporary Hit Points, and don't gain the status bonus to saves.

When they do, all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane as the sanctuary.

You win over the target’s mind, causing it to see you as a close and trusted friend and look upon your every suggestion as reasonable. The target is helpful toward you, so it will go out of its way to help you. As with any other helpful creature, there are limits to what you can ask of it. If you ever ask the target to do something completely against its nature or needlessly harmful to the target or its interests, not only does it refuse, but it also can attempt a Will save to end the effect early. Because of the casting time and range, it’s generally difficult to cast this ritual unless the target is willing (perhaps convinced the ritual will have some other effect) or restrained. If the creature is unwilling to accept the ritual, it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.218,r=0.907,b=0.403), with ID 10d31ee2-33c0-42f4-8902-61fc93ea4961 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration showing two characters, an elf and a robed figure, performing a magical ritual or pact in a cathedral-like setting, with a glowing stained glass window and magical energy connecting their hands.

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • Two characters stand facing each other in the foreground: one is an elf with long white hair and pointed ears, wearing dark leather armor with multiple daggers strapped to their back; the other is a robed figure in ornate blue and gold clothing, with a yellow head covering and decorative jewelry.
  • Both characters are raising their right arms, which are clasped together and enveloped in a dramatic, glowing magical effect with black and yellow energy shards.
  • The background features a large, arched stained glass window with a radiant angelic figure and golden light streaming through, suggesting a sacred or ceremonial location.
  • The word "HEARTBOND" appears in a small label at the bottom right corner.

Technical Details : 
  • The illustration uses a rich, warm color palette dominated by golds, blues, and browns.
  • Lighting is focused on the center, highlighting the magical effect and the stained glass window.
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The image is digitally painted, with high detail in costumes and magical effects.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The elf is positioned on the left, slightly in front, with their left arm extended backward.
  • The robed figure is on the right, facing the elf, with their left hand resting on their hip.
  • The magical energy forms the central focal point, directly in front of the stained glass angel, visually linking the characters and the background.

Analysis : 
  • The composition emphasizes a moment of connection or ritual, with the magical energy and stained glass suggesting themes of unity, power, or divine intervention.
  • The title "HEARTBOND" implies a significant bond or pact being formed between the two characters.
  • The setting and costumes indicate a high-fantasy context, possibly from a game or illustrated story. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.001,t=0.060,r=0.875,b=0.522), with ID 74075dea-9232-4779-97de-0c257c890903 -->

Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level  
You call forth the target’s soul and attempt to incarnate it into a brand-new body. As the soul won’t be returning to the original body, only a small portion of the creature’s remains are required. These remains must have been part of the original body at the time of death, and the target must have died within the past week. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the Religion check and can end the ritual without paying the cost. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.724,r=0.472,b=0.878), with ID 24c00cbf-a654-4411-b986-d309a5578760 -->

Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and no spells prepared.

Failure You fail to reincarnate the target.
Critical Failure The target’s soul becomes trapped in an unintelligent animal creature of the GM’s choosing, with a level no greater than half the target’s level.

Though it doesn’t have any of the original’s special abilities,

You must be able to identify the location precisely both by its position relative to the location where you create the teleportation circle and by the destination's appearance (or other identifying features). The destination must also be a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn't overlap with any solid structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.531,t=0.634,r=0.903,b=0.800), with ID cb348f36-9c47-49ee-9e27-7557a61f49cf -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-themed illustration showing a goblin-like creature and a human figure in a magical library, surrounded by blue spectral entities and floating objects, with the label "PHANTASMAL CUSTODIANS" at the bottom right.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are a goblin-like creature on the left, wearing patchwork clothing and goggles, and a human figure on the right in a brown leather coat with metallic details.
  • The setting is an old, arched library with tall bookshelves, wooden furniture, and a large window letting in daylight.
  • The composition is dynamic, with the goblin pointing at a glowing blue crystal held by the human, while blue, ghostly, phantasmal figures float throughout the room.
  • The color palette is dominated by warm browns and cool blues, with magical blue light providing contrast.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The label "PHANTASMAL CUSTODIANS" appears in a gold-bordered box at the bottom right.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible textures on clothing, books, and magical effects.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The goblin is in the left foreground, facing and gesturing toward the human on the right.
  • The human is positioned in the right foreground, holding a glowing blue crystal toward the goblin.
  • Blue phantasmal figures and floating books/papers are distributed throughout the background and midground, creating a sense of magical activity.
  • The window in the background provides a central light source, illuminating the scene.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a magical, possibly chaotic environment where spectral custodians are present, likely summoned or controlled by the blue crystal.
  • The interaction between the goblin and the human suggests a moment of discovery or warning, with the goblin appearing alarmed or instructive.
  • The overall visual message emphasizes the supernatural and mysterious nature of the library and its inhabitants. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=-0.000,t=0.061,r=0.875,b=0.521), with ID 3c013cb0-20ba-480e-9b1d-95944f563cc4 -->

This ritual has long been used to guard the private sanctums of powerful rulers, spellcasters, and other figures of import. You and the other casters spend the casting time burning incense, anointing doorframes, and drawing lines of powered silver across entryways. The ritual creates the following magical effects within the area; these effects are heightened to the rank of *ward domain* and remain throughout the duration. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.541,r=0.860,b=0.647), with ID d2d43b00-361f-4984-af70-c6cd506a3093 -->

All gates, doors, windows, and similar apertures in the area (if any) are locked, with the effects of lock. In addition, you can obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within the area with the effects of illusory object to appear as plain walls. Scrying spells can’t perceive any stimuli from the area, and ward domain attempts to counteract teleportation effects into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual’s save DC – 10. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.488,t=0.648,r=0.860,b=0.769), with ID 3c32b844-61d0-4064-b82e-e33747926e52 -->

A successful *dispel magic* used on a specific effect removes only that effect (such as the *lock* effect on one window). A successful *detonate magic* ends the entire ritual.
**Critical Success** You create the effects described above, and you protect an area twice as large.
**Success** You create the effects described above. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.771,r=0.858,b=0.861), with ID 1ae17166-d161-4ac3-8347-76f357891b9e -->

# CHAPTER 6:
## TREASURE TROVE

*The investigator’s trusty detective tools, a swashbuckler’s flashy dueling cape, and a champion’s shining armor are nearly as iconic as the characters who use them. For any hero, the gear and treasure they wield and collect throughout their adventures can play as important a role as any other facet of their character, from weapons steeped in cultural history to fantastic treasures of unparalleled worth!* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.073,r=0.866,b=0.229), with ID ab89196d-cf4d-488d-82a8-2823287a48be -->

This chapter presents a variety of brand-new equipment
and treasure that expands on and supplements the
options provided in Chapter 6: Equipment of _Player
Core_ and Chapter 5: Treasure Trove of _GM Core_. In
particular, the gear that follows is especially suitable for
the new ancestries and classes presented in this book,
but this multitude of new items can enhance and enrich
all types of characters. Rules for activating and investing
items, as well as a guide for reading an item’s stat block,
begin on page 219 of _GM Core_. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.261,r=0.473,b=0.421), with ID adc81c4d-382e-4e0b-a44c-2c2e5c2386cf -->

WEAPONS & MATERIALS  
Information on new weapons and a rare special material begins on page 276. This section includes class kits for the new classes presented in this book, so you can quickly equip a new character with the armor, weapons, and gear they’ll need to start adventuring! The full rules for weapons and adventuring gear appear in Chapter 6 of *Player Core*. This section also contains the new precious material dragonhide. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.427,r=0.473,b=0.574), with ID f3ba294c-e12d-49ae-9250-6545483c0c34 -->

Armor & Armaments  
This section has a new assortment of new magic armor, shields, and weapons that are all specific items. If you want to create such an item with only abilities from runes, use those found in GM Core. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.580,r=0.472,b=0.666), with ID a3b3f045-598f-4fbf-86bc-081c77f74adf -->

# Alchemical Items
Alchemical items are consumable, non-magical items that rely on the properties of volatile alchemical reagents to produce their effects. Alchemical items also appear starting on page 244 of _GM Core_, but this book contains all those items and more, particularly for the use of the alchemist class. The alchemical items in this book are presented by level in the Alchemical Items by Level Table on pages 281–282 as a reference for alchemists and other characters with alchemical abilities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.673,r=0.473,b=0.834), with ID 2915ea89-9c24-49e6-b9fa-c80a71ead0bd -->

Snares

Snares are small, simple traps to damage or hamper your foes that you can create and deploy quickly enough to utilize on a battlefield. Snares are non-magical consumable items. This section includes the full rules for creating and using snares. The Snare <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.842,r=0.461,b=0.942), with ID c21e862d-82d6-42c4-bf13-673337268c19 -->

Crafting feat (page 234) and snarecrafter archetype (page 216) are the primary ways to gain snares. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.484,t=0.263,r=0.865,b=0.298), with ID b1b65cea-bfa2-40d2-878c-47d3822a414d -->

## MOMENTARY MAGIC
The items in this section are consumables. An item with the consumable trait can be used only once and is then destroyed. Here you’ll find new ammunition, oils, potions, talismans, and wondrous consumables. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.306,r=0.864,b=0.389), with ID 0b48be8a-5f8e-48bd-a579-3214cba6712c -->

Trappings of Power  
The permanent items found here are typically held in the hands or worn on the body. These include new held items, staves, a variety of specific magic wands, and worn items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.485,t=0.398,r=0.863,b=0.466), with ID 647f79f3-ca94-40df-80da-1924c5ed5797 -->

# TREASURE TABLE
The Treasure Table on pages 312–314 presents all the new items appearing in this book, organized by level and item category to help you find the appropriate gear for your character or adventure. The tables are divided by level, split into consumables or permanents, and then organized by item categories within each table. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.475,r=0.863,b=0.587), with ID 733dae50-f60b-4ece-aab1-eea4a1955b9b -->

# WEAPONS & MATERIALS
*The following weapons and new dragonhide material are of particular interest to members of ancestries and classes introduced in this book.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.086,r=0.906,b=0.157), with ID 3d46a019-b7df-48eb-95d3-61addb3772a3 -->

WEAPONS
From tripkee clubs to catfolk blades to tengu slings, many of the weapons presented here are often used by particular societies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.182,r=0.514,b=0.251), with ID 3d5c7f42-f08f-4985-9c26-56c62910e1ee -->

## New Weapon Traits
The weapons in this section use the following new traits, in addition to those found on pages 282–283 of _Player Core_. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.260,r=0.514,b=0.310), with ID 84cc4440-6424-47a9-b6d5-843b87c26f76 -->

Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. After you hit with the weapon, you can use an Interact action to give the target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds. The penalty ends after the target takes a move action, at the start of your next turn, if you attack with the weapon, or if you move out of reach of the target, whichever comes first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.311,r=0.513,b=0.418), with ID 220ba88f-6b5e-4600-a7a1-3dbd0dd246ad -->

**Modular:** The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.419,r=0.513,b=0.524), with ID 0fb60a7c-100d-483c-9f87-89cea6332539 -->

Razing: This weapon is particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields and animated objects), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.526,r=0.512,b=0.617), with ID 193fd50e-b6bc-451d-81c4-e26bf3359971 -->

**Tethered:** This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand (including if you’ve just thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand holding nothing but the weapon’s tether), you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it’s being held by another creature). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.140,t=0.618,r=0.512,b=0.741), with ID 77c421cf-a4f8-4807-9ad3-3ffec6042bab -->

Weapon Descriptions  
Each of the weapons listed in the weapon tables on page 275 are described below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.139,t=0.751,r=0.511,b=0.800), with ID 0b6c45be-21c8-4423-bbd0-8070deaff095 -->

**Adze:** A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an axe—but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical. The adze’s shape makes it popular among woodworkers, and tripkee builders often use them to construct their treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon, due in part to the immense strength required to swing it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.141,t=0.802,r=0.512,b=0.892), with ID f317f61d-0cca-4cc5-b434-7841cdb5bceb -->

**Breaching Pike:** Forged with a heavy metal wedge effective at damaging enemy shields, breaching pikes are often used by hobgoblin infantry alongside a tower shield. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.142,t=0.893,r=0.512,b=0.939), with ID 29eb94c6-7658-4206-8043-90e33d863efe -->

**Capturing Spetum:** Hobgoblins use these polearms both as standard issue for aggressive military units and on an individual basis for hunting fugitives. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.189,r=0.903,b=0.233), with ID 60a11e1d-5172-4e91-88b4-10b69a13f66a -->

Claw Blade: This handheld weapon’s three parallel blades extend between the fingers to resemble the natural claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a way for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to share the fighting customs of their kin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.234,r=0.902,b=0.309), with ID 7625b0e7-2f9d-4b18-9707-1c18d676c877 -->

**Cruik:** This specialized club is designed for throwing and useful in both combat and hunting. Tripkees use them to take down creatures that hide high in treetops. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.311,r=0.902,b=0.356), with ID 043e2c6e-457e-487c-9cdc-fd6b2ba0510c -->

**Daikyu:** This asymmetrical bow, made of laminated bamboo, wood, and leather, stands 6 feet or more in height. It’s most often used while mounted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.357,r=0.902,b=0.402), with ID 9d8d32b9-852f-43e0-b8f4-2046a1b04020 -->

**Fangwire:** This kobold wire is thin and hard to see, making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder flicks one handle around a vulnerable spot so that it serves as a catch for the wire, then yanks the other handle back, pulling the wire tight and inflicting painful lacerations. The function and name come from a wire-based trap called a “slow fang.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.404,r=0.902,b=0.494), with ID 3b000a61-7fc4-47ee-84d0-67e8f2e127f8 -->

**Hand Adze:** The adze’s smaller version is useful for
delicate woodworking in cramped spaces. Tripkees use hand
adzes for crafting and as close quarters weapons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.496,r=0.901,b=0.539), with ID 524127e2-5363-43e4-9b39-7be468266652 -->

**Khopesh:** This curved sickle sword has a pointed tip, allowing it to be swung in wide arcs or thrust vertically around enemy defenses. The tip of a khopesh is hooked and can be used to trip an opponent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.542,r=0.902,b=0.601), with ID 2c1a3009-8c40-407d-9e81-4243e2311dd3 -->

**Mambele:** Also known as a hunga munga or danisco, this knife-axe hybrid consists of a hilt and blade that curves backward toward the wielder. The blade’s curve is such that, after a mambele has struck a victim, more damage is dealt as the weapon is extracted from the victim’s body. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.603,r=0.902,b=0.677), with ID f98598f3-dbe4-42f0-b33a-c842ddcc0aba -->

**Flying Talon:** This weapon consists of a three-pronged barbed hook attached to a length of chain. It can be used in melee to stab foes or hurled at a range. Some kobolds are particularly fond of using flying talons, especially as a sort of badge of office above those who serve them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.680,r=0.902,b=0.753), with ID 4e23a299-44f3-4308-8207-441729cc6810 -->

Spirit Thresher: Bones, some solid and others splintered, are affixed to metal chains at the end of a long stick to form a powerful flail. Many kholo warriors insist the vicious crack the weapon makes as it strikes loosens fragments of the soul like husks struck from grains. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.756,r=0.901,b=0.831), with ID bfd148c8-a832-4afe-a106-3fbb74f12f21 -->

**Tengu Gale Blade:** This fan-shaped sword designed by tengu smiths has five broad blades that join at its hilt. Tengu sailors use them as makeshift weather vanes, for the sword spins in the wind’s direction when loosely held aloft. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.833,r=0.901,b=0.891), with ID 6cceee54-a9c1-4473-a5a5-2bc9535507d6 -->

**Thunder Sling:** Tengu use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.533,t=0.894,r=0.902,b=0.937), with ID c81b5b00-eee2-4a06-bdd8-2f89a89311ad -->

# Precious Materials
Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for base materials. Items made of a precious material cost more than typical items; not only does precious material cost more, but the crafter must invest more time working with it. In addition, more powerful items require precious materials of greater purity. Many precious materials and the process for crafting with them are described starting on page 252 of GM Core. A new precious material, dragonhide, is described below. The Price entry gives the price of a simple non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk (if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk) as well as prices for different amounts of the material. Armor and shields made of dragonhide are included here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.074,r=0.516,b=0.297), with ID 9bbc481d-0c49-434f-91e4-39422464b047 -->

UNCOMMON  PRECIOUS
The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color and texture, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to dragonhide’s resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the tradition associated with the dragon (see the table below).

Summary : This image shows two fantasy equipment items made from dragonhide: a full suit of armor and a round shield, both featuring a scale pattern.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The left side displays a full set of dragonhide armor, including a helmet, chest piece, pauldrons, gauntlets, greaves, and boots, all covered in reddish-brown dragon scales.
  • The right side shows a round shield with a matching dragon scale pattern and four visible metal studs around the rim.
  • Both items are labeled: "DRAGONHIDE ARMOR" (left) and "DRAGONHIDE SHIELD" (right).
  • The background is a plain, light beige color, emphasizing the items.

Technical Details :
  • The armor and shield are illustrated in a stylized, cartoon-like manner.
  • No scale bar, measurements, or real-world references are present.
  • The dragonhide scales are depicted with a shiny, reflective texture, suggesting durability and strength.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The armor is shown as if worn by an invisible figure, facing forward.
  • The shield is presented flat, with its face toward the viewer, to the right of the armor.

Summary : This illustration displays three distinct types of fantasy armor, each with a unique design and name: Holy Chain, Ghoul Hide, and Unholy Plate.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Three armor sets are depicted, each labeled with its name.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement is provided.

  • "HOLY CHAIN" features gold and silver chainmail with ornate shoulder and waist pieces.

Spatial Relationships :

This elegant +1 striking sword cane serves equally well as both a fashionable accessory and a hidden weapon suitable for high-society events where weapons aren’t typically permitted.  
Activate—Hide Magic ![figure: black diamond icon] (manipulate) Effect You twist the sword cane’s hilt, magically merging the blade into the cane. While the blade is merged, it can’t be drawn and gains the benefits of a 3rd-rank disguise magic spell to appear non-magical. Passive observers can’t attempt a check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane, if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing so is extremely difficult (DC 30 Perception).

Because this sense detects spiritual energy, a creature that’s immune to spirit can’t be detected in this way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.740,r=0.907,b=0.862), with ID 9c5608b0-c321-4d40-ae5f-6910e1c65c7a -->

# ALCHEMY

_Alchemical items aren’t magical. They instead use the properties of volatile chemicals, exotic minerals, potent plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as alchemical reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set amount of time or until they’re countered in some way, typically physically._ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.085,r=0.866,b=0.207), with ID 531bd31f-4749-480a-b67a-0762c3d67bb0 -->

Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times, they straddle
the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable.
Alchemists explore the secrets of these reagents, learning
how to blend their essence with these special chemicals
to efficiently create short-lived alchemical items at no
monetary cost. Even in these cases, alchemical items
don’t radiate magic auras, instead using the alchemist’s
infused essence as one additional catalyst for the item’s
alchemical effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.231,r=0.473,b=0.387), with ID 032a3a7e-342a-4da1-878a-2f4ccdbf1175 -->

Rules for creating alchemical items are found in the Craft activity (*Player Core* 236), and you must have the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to use Crafting to create alchemical items. Critically failing a Crafting check to make alchemical items often causes a dangerous effect, such as an explosion for a bomb or accidental exposure for a poison, in addition to losing some of the materials. Some alchemical items have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these items list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.387,r=0.474,b=0.540), with ID 0cb0bf15-d5da-4a15-ae9d-2f11024f859b -->

All alchemical items have the alchemical trait. Most
also have the consumable trait, which means that the
item is used up once activated. The bomb, elixir, mutagen,
and poison traits indicate special categories of alchemical
items, each of which is described on the following pages.
Alchemical items without any of these traits are called
alchemical tools and are described further on page 295. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.540,r=0.473,b=0.650), with ID 6fd3cc75-be15-4ad2-a362-6630707592e0 -->

# Alchemical Bombs
An alchemical bomb combines volatile components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.075,r=0.472,b=0.157), with ID 2897a18b-6575-4cd6-925b-fd2019d130cb -->

Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you make
a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as you would
for any other weapon. It takes one hand to draw, prepare,
and throw a bomb. The bomb is activated when thrown
as a Strike—you don’t have to activate it separately. As
consumables, bombs can’t have runes etched onto them,
have talismans attached to them, or benefit from runes
granted in other ways (such as from spells or from items
that replicate runes from other items). Spells and magic
items that give you a bonus to all your attacks (or to all
thrown weapons, for example) can still apply to them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.158,r=0.472,b=0.343), with ID 05bcbec5-4f5e-4393-9b9b-b652cd53cab3 -->

Splash Trait  
Some weapons and effects, such as alchemical bombs, have the splash trait. When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure, success, or critical success and to all other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success. On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.352,r=0.471,b=0.556), with ID 7cc5be44-726b-454c-8221-4cc57503d8ac -->

For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target takes only 1 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.557,r=0.471,b=0.679), with ID c402ae55-2bc8-492c-a1e8-37d47a492f83 -->

This clear, bitter liquid can be ingested to change certain secondary sex characteristics. Different formulations create different changes—for example, one variety might cause the voice to deepen and promote body and facial hair growth, while another might cause fat redistribution around the hips and the growth of breasts. These changes tend to be accompanied by shifting of the fat in the face, sometimes dramatically or sometimes more subtly changing the user’s appearance. Changes from this elixir take place gradually over the course of months or years, depending on the type.

Mutagens

Mutagens are a special type of elixir that temporarily transmogrify the subject’s body and mind. Typically, only alchemists have the expertise to craft mutagens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.076,r=0.470,b=0.142), with ID 874b9e70-9ebd-4616-8c35-d867279afd7b -->

A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects (listed in the Benefit entry) and one or more detrimental effects (shown in the Drawback entry). Mutagens are polymorph effects (*Player Core* 301), and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item’s level and a modifier equal to that level’s DC – 10, as found on the Magic Item DCs Table on page 133 of *GM Core*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.142,r=0.471,b=0.266), with ID cb8104a9-3577-4e65-8448-671031267bb6 -->

Summary : This illustration from Pathfinder Player Core 2 displays three different types of mutagen potions, each with a distinct bottle design and label.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image features three potion bottles, each labeled as a different mutagen: Drakeheart Mutagen, Juggernaut Mutagen, and Quicksilver Mutagen.
  • The Drakeheart Mutagen is in a green, round-bottomed bottle with a cork and a tag showing a draconic image.
  • The Juggernaut Mutagen is in a squat, dark bottle with a rope and tag, featuring a stylized image of a muscular arm.
  • The Quicksilver Mutagen is in a tall, slender, clear vial with a pointed stopper and a silvery liquid inside.
  • The background is a neutral beige, with a green header displaying the Pathfinder Player Core 2 branding.
  • On the left, there is partial fantasy artwork showing a muscular, monstrous figure.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement is present.
  • The labels and tags on each bottle are clearly visible and correspond to the mutagen type.
  • The Pathfinder logo and "Player Core 2" are prominently displayed at the top.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The three bottles are evenly spaced horizontally across the center of the image.
  • The labels for each mutagen are directly below their respective bottles.
  • The fantasy artwork is confined to the left margin, separated from the main content.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually distinguishes each mutagen by unique bottle shapes and label imagery, aiding in quick identification for players.
  • The arrangement and clear labeling suggest these are key alchemical items in the Pathfinder game, likely with different in-game effects.
  • The design emphasizes fantasy aesthetics and thematic consistency with the Pathfinder universe. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.010,t=0.004,r=0.987,b=0.290), with ID a6a60aea-51f2-453e-86b4-003eddebc47b -->

# Alchemical Poisons
Alchemical poisons are potent toxins distilled or extracted from natural sources. Each poison’s stat block includes the price and features for a single dose. Poison doses are typically kept in a vial or some other secure container. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.075,r=0.472,b=0.158), with ID 454adcff-f94a-4298-a9da-7e3552f6a650 -->

Applying alchemical poisons uses manipulate actions. A
poison typically requires one hand to pour into food or
scatter in the air. Applying a poison to a weapon or another
item requires two hands, with one hand holding the
weapon or item. The Usage entry for a poison indicates the
number of hands needed for a typical means of application,
but the GM might determine that using poisons in other
ways functions differently. Weapons and items can have
only one poison applied to them at a time, even if those
poisons have different methods of exposure. If a second
poison is applied to an item, the lower-level poison is
removed (chosen randomly if both are the same level). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.159,r=0.472,b=0.341), with ID d74cc7b0-4f3c-45b7-82c5-92781e71e939 -->

The full rules for how poisons and other afflictions work are on page 430 of *Player Core*. A creature attempts the listed saving throw as soon as it’s exposed to the poison; on a failed save, the creature advances to Stage 1 of the poison after any listed onset time elapses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.341,r=0.470,b=0.420), with ID 897700c8-435d-4874-bf14-13c4250b2928 -->

**Virulent Poisons:** Some poisons have the virulent trait. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.419,r=0.471,b=0.481), with ID efef860a-8344-4301-9483-15715e641c69 -->

Method of Exposure  
Each alchemical poison has one of the following traits, which define how a creature can be exposed to that poison. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.491,r=0.470,b=0.540), with ID 0487915e-24e2-4b40-824f-4ed5f68ef24c -->

**Contact:** A contact poison is activated by applying it to an item or directly onto a living creature’s skin. The first creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly, the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself. Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.541,r=0.470,b=0.678), with ID 40c9339f-22e6-4aa5-89a3-b056939984ad -->

**Ingested:** An ingested poison is activated by applying
it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature,
or by placing it directly into a living creature’s mouth. A
creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison
when it consumes the poison, or the food or drink treated
with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons
typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.679,r=0.470,b=0.786), with ID b229c357-08fc-477d-aac9-b0890aa2d822 -->

Inhaled: An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a strong wind dissipates it. Every creature entering this cloud is exposed to the poison and must attempt a saving throw against it; a creature aware of the poison before entering the cloud can use a single action to hold its breath and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw for 1 round. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.097,t=0.786,r=0.469,b=0.908), with ID fb1efefe-c3fd-42ea-be8d-5fd0e464ea51 -->

**Injury:** An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.098,t=0.909,r=0.470,b=0.938), with ID 62b4efd9-6a66-4cf6-88ff-20a75becefcc -->

first Strike made using the poisoned item. If that Strike is
a success and deals piercing or slashing damage, the target
must attempt a saving throw against the poison. On a failed
Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison remains on
the weapon and you can try again. On a critical failure, or if
the Strike fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some
other reason, the poison is spent, but the target is unaffected. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.080,r=0.860,b=0.189), with ID b5fd6750-344a-4817-a9b2-a3e55e3deb6a -->

This pale-blue ink dries rapidly, becoming fully transparent 1 minute after application. The ink glows red when exposed to heat, such as that from a torch or other open flame. This glow lasts only as long as the ink is exposed to heat, after which the ink becomes invisible again.

Summary : This image is a selection of two illustrated items from the Pathfinder Player Core 2, each with a label and a visual representation.

illustration:
Scene Overview : 
  • Two fantasy-themed items are depicted side by side on a beige background.
  • The left item is a scroll labeled "GHOST INK" with a ghostly arrow drawn on it.
  • The right item is a rough, metallic-looking stone labeled "PHILOSOPHER'S STONE".
  • The top of the image includes the Pathfinder Player Core 2 branding in green and gold.
Technical Details : 
  • Both items are rendered in a painterly, digital art style.
  • No scale bar or measurement is present.
  • Labels are in uppercase, brown text beneath each item.
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The scroll (Ghost Ink) is on the left, the stone (Philosopher's Stone) is on the right, both centered vertically.
  • The items are separated by empty space, with no overlap.
Analysis : 
  • The image serves as a visual reference for two distinct magical or alchemical items from the Pathfinder universe, highlighting their appearance and names for easy identification. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.023,t=0.009,r=0.973,b=0.222), with ID 9075dd2c-7e64-4a17-8b6e-12bd71c23393 -->

At a glance, a philosopher’s stone appears to be an ordinary,
sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a
Force Open action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone’s heart.
The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can
transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir
of rejuvenation (page 288). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.134,t=0.231,r=0.517,b=0.325), with ID a17489d5-2c2f-4d43-933a-066357b5b5da -->

- • You can apply the stone’s quicksilver to an infused true elixir of life using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused elixir of rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesn’t require any crafting time or additional materials.
- • You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to Earn Income using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.327,r=0.516,b=0.526), with ID 9919d32b-039a-4da2-9e43-19239f3fcba2 -->

You can apply snake oil on a wound or other outward symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour, the symptom disappears, and the wounded or afflicted creature doesn’t feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding at a DC 17 Perception check, but only if it uses a Seek action to specifically examine the snake oil’s effects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.444,r=0.906,b=0.662), with ID 52dcba58-35bf-4d14-9d77-6ed7d3062e38 -->

You sprinkle these salts onto a single object up to 10 cubic feet in volume and no more than 40 Bulk to preserve it for 1 week. The object doesn’t decay, and effects that require the object to be fresh don’t count the time passing during this duration as having elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse, this extends the period in which a creature can be revived by magic as well as the wait time required before a corpse can be targeted again with talking corpse. The salts prevent ordinary pests from consuming the target (such as maggots for a corpse or moths for a piece of clothing). Any creature can use an Interact action to disperse the salts from an unattended object and end this effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.674,r=0.905,b=0.939), with ID be29b33d-ceb8-43fe-926e-dc4be50821fe -->

# SNARES

*Snares are simple traps that can be created quickly with the Snare Crafting feat (page 234) to injure or bedevil intruders. Unlike other items, found snares can’t be collected or sold in their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.085,r=0.867,b=0.173), with ID 023851e4-64f5-4ec6-878c-ca3fd1ffb9ab -->

Crafting Snares  
A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Only one snare can occupy a single 5-foot square at a time. Once constructed, it can’t be moved without destroying (and often triggering) the snare. Snares usually last until they’re triggered, though at the GM’s discretion, certain snares might become inert after extended periods of time (such as months or years). Snares made for quick deployment, such as those from the Snarecrafter archetype, are less durable and become inert after 24 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.196,r=0.473,b=0.356), with ID e23d42ad-1a23-46eb-8852-dae1c4fc8bb3 -->

You must have the Snare Crafting feat as well as be wielding or wearing a snare toolkit (which is a type of artisan’s toolkit, as found on page 287 of Player Core) to create snares. You can spend 1 minute to Craft a snare by expending an amount of money equal to the snare’s listed Price. This expenditure represents the use of raw materials that are included in your snare toolkit. If you want to Craft a snare at a discount, you must spend downtime as described in the Craft activity. Some snares have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these snares list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry. Despite having the consumable trait, you make only one snare when you spend the minute to Craft a snare. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.357,r=0.473,b=0.558), with ID d1065857-5c3d-4ecd-8cb6-3c6d6185036e -->

Detecting Snares  
Creatures can detect snares they aren’t already aware of as they would any trap or hazard (as described on page 98 of GM Core), using the creator’s Crafting DC as the snare’s Stealth DC. If your proficiency rank is expert or better in Crafting, only creatures actively searching can find your snares. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.566,r=0.472,b=0.680), with ID 44024d94-b5e0-491c-b8d2-31e7928c7c24 -->

Triggering Snares  
Unless stated otherwise in a snare’s description, when a Small or larger creature enters a snare’s square, the snare’s effect occurs, and then the snare is destroyed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.689,r=0.470,b=0.757), with ID 859cb115-8869-4643-b4fa-a597b8db495a -->

**Disabling Snares**  
Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much like it can other physical traps, using the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of the snare’s creator as the DC. You can automatically disarm a snare that you personally Crafted without triggering it by taking an Interact action while adjacent to the snare. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.766,r=0.470,b=0.877), with ID e12f91b2-abf3-4f5f-9c1c-8b75f711851a -->

Snares can’t be targeted by Strikes or other attacks
unless otherwise noted. At the GM’s discretion, a snare
might be triggered or destroyed by a particularly large
effect, such as a boulder rolling through the snare’s square, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.878,r=0.471,b=0.940), with ID 6cc0ee09-b516-4a13-b976-cf85d52a24a1 -->

or an area effect that specifically mentions unattended  
objects, such as _hydraulic torrent_. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.202,r=0.862,b=0.236), with ID 1cf154ef-7d58-45c1-8769-0939f5bb09ea -->

ALARM SNARE SNARE 1
AUDITORY CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE TRAP
Price 3 gp
You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an alarm snare, you designate a range between 100 to 500 feet at which it can be heard. When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that it can be heard by all creatures in the range you designated. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.243,r=0.863,b=0.389), with ID 67b12681-a8e8-4277-af08-f544a839c85a -->

# MOMENTARY MAGIC

*This section contains magical items with the consumable trait, which might turn the tide of battle but are destroyed after activation.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.085,r=0.866,b=0.156), with ID 9af51e9c-bc12-411e-97d2-b17e65999c9b -->

## AMMUNITION
These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons. Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry that lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or “any” if it’s not limited to any particular type. All stat blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use the standard rules in Chapter 6 of _Player Core_ for the type of ammunition to determine reloading times and Bulk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.182,r=0.472,b=0.325), with ID cfdc57aa-a69d-408c-b4f3-c126158064af -->

When using magic ammunition, use your ranged
weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack
modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your
weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states
otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic
ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition
to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.326,r=0.472,b=0.433), with ID dff093a6-4891-4d90-8a7c-dbb17fb751bb -->

Regardless of whether an attack with magic
ammunition hits or misses, launching the ammunition
consumes its magic. Magic ammunition is made
of normal materials, not precious materials, unless
stated otherwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.433,r=0.472,b=0.511), with ID 349464d8-ed8a-4afb-9ca5-6c2ef9a7574a -->

[CONSUMABLE] [MAGICAL]
Price 7 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate ◆ (manipulate)
The creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain an escaping foe. When an activated antler arrow hits a target, glowing antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow (Player Core 283).
    If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.094,t=0.519,r=0.473,b=0.741), with ID 44176882-38a7-4038-bd3e-c7164eddd699 -->

ACID  CONSUMABLE  MAGICAL
Price 70 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [two-arrows-in-circle icon] (manipulate)
This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target’s armor. The armor takes 1d8 persistent acid damage that ignores the armor’s Hardness; if the target isn’t wearing armor, it takes the acid damage instead. This damage occurs at the end of the target’s turns. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.750,r=0.472,b=0.940), with ID deec13a8-33f7-4934-bf2e-ec41f79f1683 -->

The creature can end this effect by spending an Interact
action to wipe off the corrosive dust. Otherwise, the effect
ends once the armor becomes broken. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.486,t=0.187,r=0.862,b=0.236), with ID b851d9e3-3a3e-4e5c-9539-353e3b691516 -->

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it’s subject to a disintegrate spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target’s saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.

Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated sleep arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it grows lethargic and must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. On a failure, it takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round, and is also slowed 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.

The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its
iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an
activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into a
viper (Monster Core 316). The target is affected by the viper’s
venom, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open
space adjacent to the target. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.674,r=0.905,b=0.846), with ID 6b9e6a2c-459c-48c5-b779-9585b6f31485 -->

The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn’t use the Sustain action. It’s under the GM’s control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.532,t=0.847,r=0.903,b=0.922), with ID 6178bcac-b292-4a3f-9d51-311e7f9b1298 -->

OILS  
Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are typically applied to an object and are used up in the process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil, and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can only apply an oil to an item or creature within your reach. Because the process is so thorough, it's usually impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.074,r=0.473,b=0.252), with ID a2e877cf-3207-4df1-91f7-c28908a42632 -->

This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an animated object (Monster Core 18–19) of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an animated statue. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.258,r=0.473,b=0.417), with ID 87feb009-4f8b-425a-8cc3-b17de3e6e211 -->

This animated object has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.

The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature is invisible, the light’s position means it’s merely hidden to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than undetected. The light also negates the concealed condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn’t damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.158,r=0.861,b=0.281), with ID d98b952c-a6ea-4870-bd87-eed69c771f1a -->

## POTIONS
A potion is a magical liquid that’s activated when you drink it, which uses it up. Potions have the potion trait. You can activate a potion with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature. You can feed a potion only to a creature that’s within reach and willing or otherwise so helpless that it can’t resist. You usually need only one hand to consume a potion or feed it to another creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.075,r=0.516,b=0.205), with ID 903b9788-95eb-4c49-bd3a-1776fcc4c7e9 -->

POTION OF DISGUISE                                            ITEM 5+

UNCOMMON   CONSUMABLE   MAGICAL   POLYMORPH   POTION

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L  
Activate [two-arrows-in-circle icon] (manipulate)  
Upon imbibing this potion, you take on the appearance of a specific type of creature for 2d12 hours. The type of creature is determined when the potion is created. For example, you might have a _potion of elf disguise_ or _potion of frog disguise_. Drinking the potion doesn’t impart the knowledge of how long the effect lasts; the GM rolls the duration in secret. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.212,r=0.516,b=0.371), with ID d17f1b6c-277e-48fd-89f3-6fcc7a7b2139 -->

The disguise doesn’t change your traits or statistics, nor does it give you any of the special abilities of the creature you’re imitating. It might affect what items you can hold or wear (for example, your new form might lack opposable thumbs). The potion shrinks you down to a minimum of size Small or maintains your size if the creature is your size or larger. For example, if you are Medium and drink a _potion of fire giant disguise_, you’ll take on the appearance of a fire giant but remain Medium. The creature has to be of a specific kind, such as “leopard” or “lion” rather than just “cat,” or “fire giant” or “ogre” rather than just “giant,” but the potion can’t cause you to mimic a specific individual creature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.371,r=0.517,b=0.556), with ID 8ba5f8a9-8813-419e-b379-4e6e25735874 -->

The effects of this potion use the same rules as the Impersonate activity of Deception. Onlookers always assume you're the chosen type of creature unless they're actively Seeking. You gain a +4 status bonus to your Deception DC against such Perception checks and add your level even if untrained. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.136,t=0.556,r=0.516,b=0.632), with ID af5655e4-661d-4577-8161-f14874f3dba8 -->

Type lesser; Level 5; Price 30 gp; Craft Requirements Initial raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh of the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.632,r=0.515,b=0.678), with ID 6e161a3d-155f-4284-aaf7-540deed1a1d9 -->

The moderate potion of disguise can increase your size if the creature is larger than you, to a maximum of Large, and it can shrink you to a creature of size Tiny. This doesn’t change any <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.137,t=0.724,r=0.515,b=0.774), with ID 39ba762c-abdf-4287-86f4-f7fdd5064cf8 -->

The type of undead created depends on the condition of the corpse, resulting in either a skeleton (Monster Core 312) or a zombie (Monster Core 356). If the undead’s level would be greater than 3, the dust fails to animate it. The body must be of an appropriate size and type for the undead you wish to create—for example, you must sprinkle the dust on a horse’s skeleton to animate a skeletal horse. If more than one undead in the level range is appropriate, such as skeletal guard or skeletal champion for a Medium humanoid skeleton, you choose. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.336,r=0.516,b=0.585), with ID 9682302a-2daa-44f5-9a4c-78ce2cdb686c -->

The animated undead has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The undead creature remains animated for 1 minute before collapsing back into its corpse form. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.587,r=0.515,b=0.679), with ID 72290b44-6f80-4eff-847c-4075b4d7486e -->

INCENSE OF DISTILLED DEATH                        ITEM 12
CONSUMABLE  MAGICAL  VOID
Price 350 gp
Usage held in 1 hands; Bulk –
Activate ◆ (manipulate)
This black incense smells of fresh earth and ash. You activate the incense by lighting it, whereupon it fills a 10-foot emanation with oily smoke and potent void energy. Undead creatures gain fast healing 4 while in the area; though this healing comes from void energy, it doesn’t negatively impact living creatures. Once lit, the incense burns for 1 minute, and it can’t be extinguished. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.137,r=0.908,b=0.327), with ID 1432264d-bbe7-434d-9c3f-ee759dab65e9 -->

TAPER OF SANCTIFICATION ITEM 13
UNCOMMON CONSUMABLE DIVINE
Price 600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk –
Activate (manipulate)
This thin golden candle bears the symbol of a specific deity emblazoned on its surface, surrounded by the iconography of that deity’s faith. A taper of sanctification must be dedicated to a deity who can be sanctified to holy or unholy, and has the corresponding trait. If the deity’s sanctification lists both options, the crafter must choose one when the candle is made. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.336,r=0.907,b=0.524), with ID 91a88a9e-e8b7-4d09-907c-7df9ec12c704 -->

Once lit, this candle burns for 1 hour, and it can't be extinguished. When a willing creature spends the full hour within 10 feet of the lit candle engaging in prayer to the deity, that creature's Strikes gain the holy or unholy trait (as appropriate for the candle) until the next time that creature makes their daily preparations. During this time, the creature is bound by the deity's anathema. If they violate anathema, they lose the benefit of the taper of sanctification. A holy creature can't benefit from an unholy taper of sanctification, nor can an unholy creature benefit from a holy one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.530,t=0.525,r=0.905,b=0.678), with ID 52439f2f-b19a-4f31-8075-fb588fe3be82 -->

Held Items

CLOTH OF NULLIFICATION                ITEM 20
Price 75,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This small piece of embroidered cloth is inimical to all magic.
Activate—Nullify Magic  (manipulate) Effect You cover a magic item with the cloth or wave the cloth near a magic effect and attempt to counteract the effect or item. The cloth’s counteract check modifier is +32, and its counteract rank is 10. Regardless of the result, the cloth of nullification can’t be activated again for 2d6 hours. On a success, the effect or item is deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration, if any, continues to expire during that time. With a successful counteract check, you can instead choose to completely absorb the magic from the effect or item into the cloth of nullification. If you do, both become completely non-magical and their magic can’t be recovered, even by the remake spell.
The cloth of nullification automatically fails to counteract most artifacts and similarly powerful items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.211,r=0.473,b=0.540), with ID 656c9875-cb3e-4341-a4c1-666c60b232f6 -->

Activate—Replicate Earth 1 minute (concentrate, manipulate)
  Frequency once per day; Effect You hold the box closed and, while envisioning the terrain, turn the box clockwise three times. When you open the box, the sand reveals, in miniature, the stone terrain surrounding you, to a range of 60 feet. This shows details of paths, hills, embankments, boulders, and even artificial structures like walls and ditches, as long as they’re made of stone and earth. If you’re underground, it reveals tunnels and voids in the earth within 60 feet at your current depth. The sand maintains its shape until you close the box. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.093,t=0.549,r=0.473,b=0.803), with ID 0638996e-69bd-4161-83b9-0ba799a74093 -->

Activate—Cheat Fate ◆ (manipulate) Effect You rub your thumb on one side of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking the strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in a coin toss. No matter how the toss is resolved—letting the coin fall to the ground, slapping it down on the back of your hand, or catching it on your open palm—it always lands with the side you rubbed face up. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.487,t=0.217,r=0.863,b=0.328), with ID 2dc2ca03-1650-4111-9195-96d46c339c9b -->

STAFF OF IMPOSSIBLE VISIONS                                    ITEM 6+

UNCOMMON   MAGICAL   STAFF

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This bizarre staff is made from oak, capped with a cluster of eye-shaped gemstones that seem to move and undulate at the corner of your vision. While wielding the staff, you can peer through the eyes on the staff rather than your own, using your normal visual senses (including any benefits of spells like see the unseen). You can maneuver the staff to see things around corners, at higher elevations, or in places where the staff can fit but your head can’t. This doesn’t provide sufficient line of effect to target creatures around corners. The eyes are as vulnerable as your eyes and can be affected by anything that alters your vision, such as a blinding flash of light.

A staff of the tempest is usually crafted from the wood of a tree struck by lightning. It’s often gnarled and blackened with the occasional spark of electricity flashing from its length.
