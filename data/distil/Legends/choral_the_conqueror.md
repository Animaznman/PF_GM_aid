# CHORAL THE CONQUEROR

Choral the Conqueror

FIRST RULER OF BREVOY CE MALE HUMAN TYRANT Over two hundred years ago, the warlord Choral Rogarvia swept out from obscurity to conquer the northern nations of Issia and Rostland. With two red dragons leading his forces, the so-called Choral the Conqueror was nigh unstoppable and, in less than a year, he united the two rival nations under his double-headed dragon banner as the new nation of Brevoy.

Only ten years after seizing Brevoy, Choral vanished, along with his red dragon allies. Two hundred years later, every one of Choral's descendants vanished as well—if, indeed, the royal House Rogarvia was truly his blood. No one knows why Choral the Conqueror abandoned his throne, what happened to his family, or where they went. Wild rumors flew in the wake of Choral's disappearance, but for nearly two hundred and fifty years, as memory faded into myth, the truth seemed unknowable. Recently, however, this has begun to change.

# THE FISHERMAN'S CASKET "Is it valuable?" the fisherman asked. Wearily, Nephaira took off her spectacles and rubbed her eyes. The light was bad in this chilly, windowless shack on the shores of the Lake of Mists and Veils. Ordinarily the fishers used it for smoking fish, and decades of grimy pall blackened the interior.

Not her usual environment. But ever since fishers had started pulling up curious artifacts in their nets, and glittering treasures washed up with the lakeweed on the shores, this cold, gray corner of the north had suddenly discovered a pressing need for her services. Treasure hunters and greedy nobles clamored for her to tell them what their finds were, and whether they could be kept without reprisal from Mendev or Brevoy. Every fisher and fur trapper who plied the lake hoped that they'd stumbled upon the key that would unlock a life of luxury, or at least a way out of relentless hardship.

Nephaira hated disillusioning them. The nobles at least knew what gold looked like, and they weren't often wrong. But the poor folk... they had no idea what they were looking for, and hope so blinded them that they brought her every glass bottle they saw glinting in the sun. Taking their coin to crush their hopes never sat well with her, but her business was built on honesty, even when that honesty came hard. Many of them had come to expect her harsh answers, but they came to her anyway, because they could do nothing else.

Expecting more of the same, Nephaira unwrapped the water-stained burlap. Inside the coarse fabric was a casket of dark wood bound with tarnished metal. Its lock had been cunningly wrought as part of a large heraldic seal.

Nephaira's heart quickened at the sight. That crest— Her pulse racing, she wiped the lock with a damp cloth, forcing herself to remain calm until she could be sure. The cloth was soaked in alchemical solvents that melted away decades of mud and neglect. Bit by bit, it revealed the red and gold dragon crest of House Rogarvia.

The emblem was authentic. The red dragon scales were shimmering enamel edged in real gold, too costly and finely wrought to be an imitation. The golden shield behind it bore a unique greenish tint. Electrum, a signature limited to Brevoy's royal jewelers.

"It's real," she told the fisherman. At first, he blinked, taken utterly by surprise. He'd not expected this either, but Nephaira saw hope rekindled in his eyes.

"Is it valuable?" Desperation strained his voice. "My nets are old. My boat leaks. My children shiver for cold, day and night, and we have not enough bread. Can I sell this... this dragon box?"

"The box itself is worth... two and a half weights in gold. Anyone who offers less is trying to cheat you." Privately, Nephaira thought the fisherman would be lucky to get half that sum—his desperation was too obvious, and the nobles' agents didn't get paid for being soft-hearted—but she could at least tell him its true value. Honesty was her watchword.

"I'd like to see what's in it, though," she said.

When the fisherman nodded, Nephaira took out her tools and began cleaning out years of mud and corrosion. Slow going, but eventually she managed.

Inside were... papers. Nephaira removed them one by one, baffled. A hodgepodge of village records, letters from the hinterlands, and other miscellany. The box had been well sealed, and none of the documents evinced water damage, but she couldn't fathom why they would have warranted such protection.

The fisherman waited, fidgeting. "What are they?" Puzzled, Nephaira began reading more carefully. Midway through the fourth letter, it dawned on her. Dragons. The documents were all about dragons. Aggrieved knights seeking recompense for burned lands. Village elders recording the deaths of devoured peasants. Astrologers noting incidental sightings in the sky; physicians requesting burn ointments to treat survivors. Some of the documents were dated. Others referenced contemporaneous events, setting signposts in time. Nephaira searched her memory, measuring what she knew against what she read.

All the sightings matched times when Choral the Conqueror, first king of Brevoy, was known to be in that area—and when the royal red dragons were known to be elsewhere. Each letter was a brick in a wall of proof that Choral was not the human warlord that official historians had always claimed, but was himself a red dragon.

It couldn't be true. It *had* to be true. That ridiculous rumor, so long dismissed as the wild-eyed fancy of amateur cranks, was in fact a truth that Brevoy's early government had gone to great lengths to suppress.

She pushed her chair back, rubbing her eyes again. Outside, the sky had grown dark. She hadn't even noticed the night falling.

The fisherman, who'd dozed off, stirred. "Is it valuable?" Nephaira hesitated. The documents had been hidden, not destroyed, which suggested that someone had seen value in them centuries ago. To blackmail Choral's descendants, perhaps. But now House Rogarvia was vanished without a single survivor, and she couldn't imagine how revealing Choral's true nature would help any of the noble houses maneuvering for Brevoy's throne. The only value she could see was in completing the historical record.

"I don't think so," she answered. "But I'll buy them for a fair price." It was the wrong thing to say. Nephaira saw the fisherman's face harden. Her heart sank as he reached for the papers and swept them back into the box. "I will sell them myself," he said, firmly, and left.

Nephaira sank back into her chair. She didn't see the dark figure that peeled off the hut's shadowed wall to follow the fisherman, and she never learned what happened to the man. All she knew, then and there, was that the box with the dragon seal had been full. Too full to have held everything.

Which meant there were more documents out there, somewhere. And she would find them.

WITH SWORD AND FLAME For ten years, Choral sat on the Dragonscale Throne as the first king of Brevoy, but in all that time, he did little to unite the Issians and Rostlanders as a single people, leaving old divisions to fester while he amassed wealth in his Ruby Fortress. As king, Choral was a remote and terrifying figure, little seen by his people and less loved. Except for his rare, unpredictable tours across Brevoy—tours that he used primarily to visit terrible retribution on wayward vassals, to remind them of the price of disloyalty—Choral rarely left his seat of power in New Stetven. Without Choral or his heirs to maintain unity, the nation of Brevoy has remained split at the seams. Old rivalries and new grudges have pushed the Issians and Rostlanders to the brink of civil war. Yet some few still fear this political infighting will only attract the return and wrath of House Rogarvia, and that those who fight for the right of rule will pay the price for presuming to lay claim to King Choral's crown.
