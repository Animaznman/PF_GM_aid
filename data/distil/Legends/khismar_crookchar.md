KHISMAR CROOKCHAR

TENACIOUS NUMERIAN DRUG DEALER

NE MALE GNOME ALCHEMIST *However Khismar manages to retain the favor of the Black Sovereign in the fallout of Casandalee's ascension, it is obvious he's poisoned the well for any of his former colleagues within the borders of Starfall. As surviving remnants and other salvagers notice the Blue Streak's growing technological monopolization, they pursue more obscure leads, diligently hiding the technology they find. Some such technology hunters risk their lives for the archaeological significance of their finds rather than value or personal gain. Yet after a few technology archaeologists went missing, those who remained understood that their academic motives did not forgive their actions in the eyes of their competition. They now hire bodyguards; their families hire search parties.*

For all of the unusual Numerian features the Rain of Stars caused, the fog across the Lake of Mists and Veils is not one. It occurs naturally, and the thickness of the fog depends on the patterns of the weather. This recent dry season, the fog thinned enough for the lake's southwestern shallows to be visible. The buzz around Starfall quickly turned to the report of dozens of headless statues below the water's surface. "Was this once dry land?" "Were they sculpted after specific people? If so, given their modern and futuristic accoutrement, were they connected to the Divinity, the starship that crashed in Numeria nearly ten millennia ago?" To those who never saw the Technic League, the significance of the missing heads presents an unsolvable mystery—but those of us who recognize an old colleague's clothing might come to an obvious solution.

*What Khismar plans to do from his new position currently eludes me—every one of his clandestine schemes that I uncover leaves more questions to answer. I recognized the value in him when he came before me years ago, and admit I undersold him even then. Though he has greatly damaged my plans for the Technic League, I confess a curiosity in seeing where his actions will lead...* —Excerpt from the journal of Zernebeth, former Technic League leader

# THE TECH RAT With electric blue streaks through his black hair, laser-precise facial scars, and bioluminescent eyes and veins, Khismar Crookchar has been forever marked by Numeria. Likewise, Numeria's landscape changed when this gnome scientist

pursued his curiosity about technology, bringing his unique brand of pharmaceuticals with him.

Members of the Technic League—an influential organization of spellcasters and other lore-seekers protective of Numeria's technological secrets—had a derogatory nickname for their erstwhile collaborator Khismar Crookchar: the tech rat. For years, Crookchar evaded League surveyors thanks to an endless supply of an elixir known as hype, which allowed him to remain active during all hours. By the time Khismar was discovered, he'd studied Numerian technology so extensively that he deftly used weapons known for their unpredictability against the League members who stumbled across him. He was presented to **Captain Zernebeth** (CN female human cyborg) as "salvage." The leader of the Technic League saw more value in the gnome as a member than a slave and brought Crookchar in as an initiate.

Crookchar never rose above that rank. He would have found himself ejected into the wastelands or worse if he wasn't supplying hype to Technic League officers with uncharacteristic consistency. Not just the standard hype available across Starfall—his continued development of the formula meant his often replicated and synthesized original recipe was rapidly rendered obsolete by Khismar's newest innovations. He shared his cutting-edge variant, called plasma hype, with his superior officers and select competitive members of the Technic League looking for an edge. Any Technic League relationships Crookchar nurtured were purely for his own benefit—those who believed in the League's goals particularly resented Crookchar for abusing resources and supplying drugs to their officers.

Crookchar was always his own best customer, chasing plasma hype for days until passing out for an equal amount of time or longer. When he woke, he countered his tiredness with another cycle of energy dosing. Side effects of his hype abuse resulted in the brightening of his hair, skin, veins, and irises, and a web-like pattern on his fingernails and teeth. For most users, these side effects were subtle and temporary. Crookchar used plasma hype so frequently that he permanently altered his physiology.

# UNLIKELY ALLIES When the Technic League disbanded and most of the officers were killed in 4716 AR, the remaining members were mostly made up of those with ill will toward the tech rat. Crookchar found out the hard way how unpopular he was with the lower-ranking remnants of the League. He survived regular threats to his life thanks to being underestimated, combined with an unlikely guardian.

Gawta (LE female medusa), a hype-using medusa from a cave near Starfall, had noticed the quality and availability of her pharmaceutical of choice had diminished. She investigated, leading her to Crookchar's trail. As her kind interacted minimally with non-medusas, Gawta observed him from dunes and shadows, the only evidence of her presence being the occasional appearance of a petrified would-be assassin. When Crookchar finally discovered his unexpected protector, he made Gawta a deal: he would supply her with regular shipments of plasma hype, leaking word of delivery to suspected Technic League remnants. She petrified the remnants that pursued the rumors, delivered their stone heads to Khismar, and disposed of their bodies in the nearby Lake of Mists and Veils.

Crookchar took the heads to Numeria's Kellid ruler, the Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul. His intent was to use them as a threat and establish an arrangement similar to what the Technic League had with the hedonistic, ambivalent ruler. Crookchar unfortunately found that every rumor he'd heard about Kevoth-Kul was no longer true. In the presence of this ambitious leader and virulent hunter of former Technic League members, Crookchar rambled about being subject to

PEOPLE OF NOTE Casandalee (*Lost Omens Gods and Magic* 57), Choral the Conqueror (page 40), Kevoth-Kul (page 74), Magdelena and Martum Fallows (page 84), Tar-Baphon (page 104)

REMNANTS OF THE TECHNIC LEAGUE Though the Technic League officially dissolved in 4716 AR, some important members may have survived. They say Technic League Captain

Ozmyn Zaidow (CE male human technomancer)'s spirit fled his mind before the alien AI Unity neutralized it. Rumor is his ghost haunts Numeria with a vendetta against machines. When robots and androids act erratically, Numerians have started calling it "Zaidow's revenge." Zernebeth realized the League had been irreparably compromised. Taking advantage of the confusion and depleted roster of officers, she fled north to Mendev before Kevoth-Kul turned his rage on the remaining members. Mendev's instability covered her escape. Before the league disbanded.

Captain **Krastus** (NE male human tinkerer) shifted his specialty from cyborg animals to enhancing undead with cybernetics. Combined, these skills allowed him to amass a loyal army quickly, and he now counts himself among one of Numeria's many warlords.

One of many experiments abandoned in Silver Mount was the Brute, an AI-enhanced suit of powered armor. Despite its intelligence, it required a wearer to function. Yet the Brute has been spotted walking Numeria's plains—perhaps autonomously, or perhaps someone used it to escape Silver Mount.

# LAB NOTES *Venom Immunization Post Mortem* Ultimately, my hypothesis was disproved. Any similarities between a medusa's serpentine aspects and a comparable serpentine species are coincidental. Neon garter's venom proved impotent: only measurable effects 1 qt produced were mild cognitive impairment and moderate indigestion. Proper immunization requires direct source sample. Cognitive impairment too low to be worth developing as a weapon or to merit development for entertainment.

Technic League experimentation before offering the Black Sovereign the heads as a tribute. Kevoth-Kul took a liking to this curious glowing man who offered up his beheaded enemies unsolicited. He promised Crookchar honored standing among his tribe as long as Kevoth-Kul was regularly presented with Technic League remnants, or their remains. Taking this as a threat, Crookchar agreed.

Crookchar now does his best to live up to his side of the bargain. Occasionally this takes the form of intel on Technic League agents, but usually they are delivered in person, either whimpering and babbling due to a system full of hallucinogens or as a severed head turned to stone. Crookchar's relationship with the Black Sovereign's court allows him greater freedom to explore Numeria than most, granting him access to Numerian tech deep in Kellid territory and to Kevoth-Kul's resources. Although Crookchar takes full advantage of this relationship, it causes him constant anxiety. He knows the truth behind the lies that won Kevoth-Kul's favor could come to light, spelling certain death for the gnome.

# POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS When the remnants stopped falling for the Gawta gambit, Crookchar began actively hunting them. Occasionally, his quarries didn't present threats to him. If they had useful skills, he offered to spare them in exchange for their loyalty. Eventually he amassed a large group of technologically savvy minions. He dubbed them the Blue Streaks, after his electric-blue hair and the similarly hued stripes on Gawta's scales. The Blue Streaks helped Crookchar secure Numerian technology, eliminated Crookchar's enemies, and covered up Crookchar's other activities. It wasn't long before those Technic League members who knew Crookchar personally were all dealt with, leaving a growing number of remnants who know him only by reputation.

The closest Crookchar has come to having a friend is his accomplice Gawta the medusa. While he trusts her with his thoughts and truths, he does so because he knows her hype addiction ensures her loyalty. To cope with her dangerous gaze, they always meet in blackout hoods. Crookchar makes a point of bringing a sedated newt on his shoulder when he meets with Gawta; a sudden shift in weight where the animal rests would alert him that Gawta's veil has lifted and his life is at risk. Similarly, he only communicates with her in writing to set up meetings, and any writing they exchange is coded. Whenever Gawta confronts him on his paranoia, Crookchar points to the Blue Streaks being named after them both as indication of how highly he regards her. In truth, naming the Blue Streaks in part after the medusa's blue markings on her red scales was for plausible deniability. If the secret group is ever discovered, he will paint her as the group's sole leader—after killing Gawta and the rest of his minions, of course.

Despite his standing in the Black Sovereign's court, his relationship with Gawta, and his loyal followers, Crookchar cares only about his own goals. His multiple plots and the constant threats to his life forced his mind to finally focus on what mattered to him: survival and science. His newfound determination, along with his supply of potent pharmaceuticals, work to spread his influence across Numeria and beyond.

# SECRETS OF THE BLUE STREAKS Khismar's greatest accomplishments are alchemical in nature and his willingness to push the limits of ethics for the sake of his experiments has paid dividends. The following are some of his more notable developments. He only shares the formulas for these items with his trusted apprentices, and even then, only grudgingly so.

ALCHEMICAL ATOMIZER ITEM 10 RARE ALCHEMICAL Price 175 gp Usage held in 1 hands, Bulk L

Khismar developed this unique atomizer that allows for the distribution of elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. The atomizer can hold a single elixir, oil, or potion. An atomizer contains enough reagents to use it up to 10 times before the reagents must be replaced. A new batch of reagents costs 5 gp and requires an Interact action to replace. **Activate** ![figure: black diamond with white arrow] Interact; **Effect** You spray the contents of the atomizer on yourself or an adjacent willing ally or unattended object. The target gains the effects of the applied elixir, oil, or potion. The target must be a valid target for the effect, such as food or drink for a nectar of purification, or the consumable is lost.

**Activate** ![icon: two black diamond shapes] Interact; **Effect** You cause the atomizer to mix its reagents and fire its held consumable at a square within 30 feet. The consumable forms a cloud that fills the space. The first willing valid target to enter the space automatically gains the effect of the consumable. If there are multiple valid targets, such as with multiple weapons for _aligned oil_, the creature entering the space determines how the effect is applied. The cloud is consumed upon contact with a willing valid target or at the start of your next turn, whichever comes first.

**Hype** Crookchar's most popular and profitable development is the energizing drug hype. Although Crookchar is constantly working to improve on his formula for hype, his older formula has since become replicated and more widespread. Diluted hype is common in the city of Starfall in Numeria. Hype uses the rules for drugs, found on pages 120–121 of the *Gamemastery Guide*.

DILUTED HYPE ITEM 5 UNCOMMON ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE DRUG INGESTED POISON Price 20 gp Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L Activate ◆ Interact A synthetic adrenaline supplement that increases awareness and reaction time.

LAB NOTES Deadbomb Serum Development (Corpse Heart—discontinued) The purpose of the Corpse Heart was to create a container suitable for storage within a zombie, and brittle enough to break on impact. A fascinating side effect occurred when a fire ray killed the subject. The results were described as "flaming guts punching everyone in reach." The purpose of the deadbomb serum is to deliberately recreate this flaming guts punch. This compound will serve as contents for a Corpse Heart.
