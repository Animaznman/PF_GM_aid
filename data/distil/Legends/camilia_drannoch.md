# CAMILIA DRANNOCH

Golarion, Sorshen is convinced at least some of the cursed items and unseasonable blizzards that stray into Eurythnia are the deliberate work of the cackling witch. Sorshen's poorest relations are with her counterpart in New Thassilon, and she knows it's only a matter of time before she's forced to interfere with Belimarius's expansionist regime. Although she'd prefer to avoid killing the sadistic old woman, she worries any nonlethal outcome will leave Belimarius nursing a grudge. For now, Sorshen has decided to leave Belimarius to her own devices, hoping local heroes will topple the tyrant for her.

Scholars and spellcasters have journeyed to Eurythnia in droves, seeking wisdom from the past. Sorshen welcomes these visitors with open arms. That few of these intellectuals decide to return home has caused some to accuse Sorshen of magically charming them to empower her nation. Queen Sorshen has responded to such accusations with a dimpled smile.

# MAGIC OF NEW THASSILON The runelords of ancient Thassilon pushed the boundaries of magic, creating new spells and school specializations. Though many of their discoveries are common knowledge, others remain lost to the ravages of time or are closely guarded by select practitioners. Below are two spells the rulers of New Thassilon can teach to casters, as a reward for service or a lesson for aspiring apprentices.

OLD HOBBIES, NEW MARKETS In her free time, the former Runelord Sorshen has taken to creating perfumes, both of old formulas and new scents. Though she hasn't gone out of her way to sell her creations, her reputation has seen the fragrances slowly make their way to exclusive collectors at high prices.

LEGENDS INTRODUCTION A–G H–M N–Z ENTWINED DESTINIES GLOSSARY AND INDEX

# CAMILIA DRANNOCH ## TENACIOUS REVOLUTIONARY POLITICIAN CN FEMALE HUMAN BARD A cunning and clever figure, Chairwoman Camilia Drannoch of the Revolutionary Council is currently one of the few politicians widely respected throughout Galt. Her dedication to the ideals of revolution and her widely espoused patriotism drove her popularity among revolutionaries and common citizenry.

# AN UNCOMMON MIND Born during the Red Revolution, Camilia escaped the early chaos alongside her mother, Apalma Drannoch, who served as the Galtan ambassador to Kyonin. Camilia spent her youth among the elves, rapidly coming of age in Idara to the curious delight of the elven courts. She devoured her studies and proved to have an unusually sharp mind for someone so young, but it wasn't long before the Red Revolution called the family home. As they crossed the border, a pair of Gray Gardeners—the hooded executioners of the Galtan revolution—apprehended Apalma, dragging her through the streets of Isarn before delivering her to the _final blade, Silence_. Watching her mother lose her head and soul to the bloody guillotine shattered Camilia's world and served as her introduction to her homeland of Galt.

Camilia threw herself into politics, mourning her mother and burning with spite toward the Gray Gardeners. She rapidly gained followers with her passionate words and radical ideals. It seemed then that she made a grave error, openly questioning the Gray Gardeners' methods during a speech beside the _final blade_ that had murdered her mother. The young revolutionary found herself spirited away under the light of a full moon, a black bag covering her head. Her kidnappers promised her a kiss from _Silence_ to reunite her with her beloved family.

Her old enemies were dead through one end or another, and the Red Revolution had carried on gloriously without her. Upon exposing the Eye of Law—the ruling council of Galt at the time— a s a hag coven, Camilia Drannoch became a household name. She was immediately bequeathed a seat on the new Revolutionary Council formed to lead the nation, and she has maintained it ever since.

Camilia has since survived multiple regime changes, making her one of the few politicians to ever consistently navigate the treacherous tides of Galtan politics. She saw Citizen Goss thrown down to the rabid crowd and took his place as the chair of the Revolutionary Council. She enacted several popular reforms to bring a small sense of stability back to the nation, notably when she announced an end to the xenophobic policies that had damaged Galt's economic and political security. Her web of allies and resources extend throughout and beyond Galt, rewarding her supporters with prestige and power. Her detractors, however, are often either murdered by the mob or found dead, marred by deep blade wounds, their souls nowhere to be found.

Camilia sees the Red Revolution as part of a rising tide of change, mirrored by the earth-shattering events taking place across the continent. In her mind, all of Golarion is primed to overthrow its outdated modes of thinking, as evidenced by recent uprisings and successful abolition efforts. She openly supports the rebels of Vidrian and Kintargo while also planting her own agents to speed such efforts along.

Breaking the cycle of death that is the Red Revolution has proven to be Camilia's greatest challenge. She knows the country will never realize its full potential while the _final blades_ contribute to its cultural decline. Camilia has been building toward this moment for decades, since her own mother lost her life to the wicked devices, and she hopes that the removal of Galt's _final blades_ and dissolution of the Gray Gardeners will be her legacy.
