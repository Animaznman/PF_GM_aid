# NEX

has sent multiple diplomats to Icemark since Nankou claimed the throne, though the emissaries have often found themselves indulging in Icemark's hospitality for months while waiting for Nankou to return from the tundra. White Estrid's detractors have on more than one occasion tried to use this eagerness to disparage her, but in the face of Estrid's far greater heresy of keeping a linnorm as a pet, these attempts have usually fallen flat on their face.

Nankou also considers himself friendly with Thira Ash-Eyes, the successor to and daughter of longstanding Linnorm King **Sveinn Blood-Eagle** (CN male human barbarian). When Sveinn sailed off to Valenhall, most of his fractious children quarreled in the streets of Kalsgard, while young Thira instead hewed to the traditions of her people and set out to slay a linnorm. A practitioner of arcane magic, Thira was often overlooked and underestimated by other Ulfen, despite her skill with a blade. As she trekked out into the wilderness between Icemark and the Thanelands, she encountered Nankou in his wanderings. Already a linnorm king by this point, Nankou recognized the young warrior's aspirations and shared a fire and a meal with her. Thira claimed her own linnorm and the throne that went with it, and still remembers the Varki ranger fondly. Nankou hopes this meeting will help to strengthen the relations between the Ulfen of the Thanelands and the Varki of Icemark.

Not all of Nankou's neighbors are so pleasant. King **Ingimundr the Unruly** (CE male human barbarian) of nearby Broken Bay is notably old-fashioned and even more notably quarrelsome. Ingimundr's open encouragement of raiding remains one of Nankou's pressing threats. Though the Ulfen king claims distance from those ships who plunder other Linnorm Kingdoms, it is well-known that he also turns a blind eye to them, and Nankou's proximity no doubt marks him as an attractive target.

# THE HUNTER Nankou loves nothing so much as hunting deadly monsters. While he bears great respect for the wildlife of Icemark, he ruthlessly exterminates unnatural creatures that undermine the delicate ecosystems of his territory. Nankou has a particular hatred for taiga linnorms, and occasionally seeks out others to help him hunt the deadly beasts down. After losing an eye and taking on a deadly curse during the fight that made him a linnorm king, Nankou is not so prideful as to insist that he meet other linnorms in single combat. When Nankou can't find a group of adventurers willing to assist him in a linnorm hunt, he takes special precautions, laying elaborate traps and finding just the right environs to prepare for the battle before settling in to wait for as long as is required. Nankou and his black bear companion T'kamo possess deep wells of patience and are said to have killed more linnorms than the one he keeps at Seer's Home to ratify his claim to the title of linnorm king. Those who would hunt a linnorm would do well to accept Nankou's assistance if it is offered. picture: The lower right of the image contains a close-up of a bear's face, with one eye missing and a visible scar. The bear's mouth is slightly open, showing its teeth. The image is cropped so that only the head and part of the neck are visible. The bear appears to be Nankou, as described in the text.

Nankou constantly wanders the taiga and tundras of Icemark, occasionally slipping over the borders into his neighbors' domains. Any group that dares to travel the uncharted lands would find that the one-eyed Varki with the one-eyed bear might very well be the friendliest encounter they can expect in those environs, so long as they treat the ranger, his bear, and the Varki people with respect.

# WORDS OF THE KING Linnorm king is a silly title. I have never once had a single linnorm bow in obeisance to me or even pay my words any heed. But there is power in words, and in the meaning people invest them with. Scarcely a handful of years past my people were on the brink of war with the Ulfen, with scarce food and grim winters driving us inexorably towards a conflict that held only despair for both sides. Then I slew a great beast and called myself its king, and peace became a possibility where before we had no hope. So I shall be a linnorm king and allow those words to define me in the eyes of strangers, for doing so has given me Ulfen brothers and sisters where once only enemies stood before me. –Nankou of Icemark

ENTWINED DESTINIES GLOSSARY AND INDEX

NEX

VANISHED WIZARD KING N MALE HUMAN WIZARD The wizard Nex emerged during the decline of pharaonic Osirion, near the end of the Age of Destiny. Though clearly a legend who shaped the arcane and political landscape of Garund for nearly five millennia, Nex is a controversial figure in the modern day. At once a peerless scholar and a fierce war master, the archwizard's artifice stands in stark contrast to his centuries-long rivalry with the necromancer Geb. The clash between the two would lead to the loss of countless lives, the ravaging of both lands, the disappearance of Nex himself, and Geb's transformation to ghostly tyrant. Long absent from the kingdom bearing his name, Nex lives on in much the same way as Geb—an uneasy rumor haunting a tenuously peaceful realm.

# CHASING DESTINY Nex began his journey as an adventurer, a wizard with a peculiar fascination with conjuration and divination. Guided by insights snatched from the Great Beyond, the ambitious wizard sought to craft a mighty destiny for himself. To that end, Nex searched for power and wisdom in the ruins of civilizations long past. In his research, he sought out cryptic bas-reliefs in the Mwangi Expanse, ley lines beneath Quantium, and scrying pools in the cyclopean depths of cursed Gholanoth. His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex—a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power—and in rumored immortality. None alive can say if agelessness alone was enough for Nex to achieve his destiny, but his legacy has led countless adventurers into the Crux to build their own legend.

Soon thereafter, Nex laid his eyes upon the gem beyond compare: the city of Absalom. Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom's skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city's gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein. Serving as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex's horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society's Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard's ambition.

RIVALRY Though among the most powerful wizards of his age, Nex was not without rival in power and determination. The archwizard could be brash, and his pursuit of arcane secrets often put him at odds with beings strange and mighty. The Zenj epic Song of the Fallen Briar recounts an early adventure in which the ambitious wizard sought sky-fallen relics among the toppled temples and shattered towers of the Mwangi Expanse. According to the Song, the young wizard earned the first of his great enemies in the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, after Nex and his companions thwarted one of the powerful fey demigod's plans. The Eldest and the wizard-king would clash many times after that first encounter, most notably when Nex "borrowed" a bandersnatch to relieve a pirate siege on Quantium. Curiously, after Nex sought to invade Absalom with a horde drawn from other planes—most prominently the shadowy fey horrors Count Ranalc was known to master—the Exiled Eldest vanished from the historical record.
