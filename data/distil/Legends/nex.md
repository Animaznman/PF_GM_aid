NEX

VANISHED WIZARD KING N MALE HUMAN WIZARD The wizard Nex emerged during the decline of pharaonic Osirion, near the end of the Age of Destiny. Though clearly a legend who shaped the arcane and political landscape of Garund for nearly five millennia, Nex is a controversial figure in the modern day. At once a peerless scholar and a fierce war master, the archwizard's artifice stands in stark contrast to his centuries-long rivalry with the necromancer Geb. The clash between the two would lead to the loss of countless lives, the ravaging of both lands, the disappearance of Nex himself, and Geb's transformation to ghostly tyrant. Long absent from the kingdom bearing his name, Nex lives on in much the same way as Geb—an uneasy rumor haunting a tenuously peaceful realm.

# CHASING DESTINY Nex began his journey as an adventurer, a wizard with a peculiar fascination with conjuration and divination. Guided by insights snatched from the Great Beyond, the ambitious wizard sought to craft a mighty destiny for himself. To that end, Nex searched for power and wisdom in the ruins of civilizations long past. In his research, he sought out cryptic bas-reliefs in the Mwangi Expanse, ley lines beneath Quantium, and scrying pools in the cyclopean depths of cursed Gholanoth. His work would culminate in the Crux of Nex—a demiplane granting him nearly limitless power—and in rumored immortality. None alive can say if agelessness alone was enough for Nex to achieve his destiny, but his legacy has led countless adventurers into the Crux to build their own legend.

Soon thereafter, Nex laid his eyes upon the gem beyond compare: the city of Absalom. Drawing upon every bit of his skill and the nearly limitless power offered by the Crux, Nex conjured a mile-high spire from nothingness, an eldritch spike that tore through the earth and changed Absalom's skyline forever. The Spire of Nex, erected mere miles from the city's gate, was the opening gambit in a sudden onslaught to seize control of Absalom and the great powers safeguarded therein. Serving as a planar gateway of unfathomable power, the Spire split the skies and conjured a horde drawn from countless extraplanar realms. Yet what ended the Siege of Nex is ultimately a mystery. Legend has it that while Aroden guided the defenders against Nex's horde, the archwizard himself abandoned the battle at a critical juncture to seek the fabled *Starstone. Legacy of Cairns*, a treatise by the Pathfinder Society's Master of Spells Aram Zey, contends that Nex had nearly reached that mighty relic when the archwizard quit the field entirely, unwilling or unable to pay the final price for divinity. Though Absalom successfully defended itself against the mighty mage, the Spire of Nex still looms over the City at the Center of the World, a monument to the archwizard's ambition.

RIVALRY Though among the most powerful wizards of his age, Nex was not without rival in power and determination. The archwizard could be brash, and his pursuit of arcane secrets often put him at odds with beings strange and mighty. The Zenj epic Song of the Fallen Briar recounts an early adventure in which the ambitious wizard sought sky-fallen relics among the toppled temples and shattered towers of the Mwangi Expanse. According to the Song, the young wizard earned the first of his great enemies in the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, after Nex and his companions thwarted one of the powerful fey demigod's plans. The Eldest and the wizard-king would clash many times after that first encounter, most notably when Nex "borrowed" a bandersnatch to relieve a pirate siege on Quantium. Curiously, after Nex sought to invade Absalom with a horde drawn from other planes—most prominently the shadowy fey horrors Count Ranalc was known to master—the Exiled Eldest vanished from the historical record.

No account of the wizard-king is complete without mention of his greatest rival, the necromancer Geb. The two archwizards blurred national lines with alarming frequency, each seeking to expand their reach at the expense of the other. Raids and skirmishes would evolve over decades and centuries into a deadly war, as Nex and Geb inflicted increasingly bizarre sorceries upon one another. From plagues that ossified hapless farmers to crawling behemoths the rival of any dragon, the devastating powers unleashed created a blighted no-man's land between the two nations, called the Mana Wastes. As thousands perished, the wizard-kings artificially extended their lives through obscure and perilous sorceries, creating a cold war that would span generations, ending suddenly when a Gebbite attack wreathed the city of Quantium in poisonous fumes. Though the attack cost countless lives, Nex was able to retreat to his personal demiplane, the Refuge of Nex, while the city rallied a defense, only for the wizard to vanish entirely from Golarion. Geb, haunted by an enemy truly beyond his reach for decades, finally ended his life a full 60 years later. Nex has yet to emerge from the Refuge, but his legend still looms over Garund.

# PERILOUS STIRRINGS Millennia after his disappearance, cryptic signs point to the stirring of an ancient power. New horrors haunt the Mana Wastes: gargantuan beasts and swarms of spell-stitched abominations that stalk the already-perilous region, devouring those that wander too far from well-defended roads. High King Anong Arunak has placed a bounty on these creatures, promising a great reward to those cunning enough to track the monsters to their source and end the threat to Dongun Hold. Meanwhile, in grim Ecanus, the fleshforges have been restive of late, cycling through their birthing sequence at random and spawning abominations that vanish into the night. Chief Fleshforger **Dunn Palovar** (N male human fleshforger) is quietly seeking aid in putting down these rogue beasts as he works to discover why the forges have begun spawning of their own volition.

Mere miles from Absalom's gates, the Cairnlands groan and tremble as the Spire of Nex thrums to an alien frequency. The northern passage has grown unsafe, and city scouts report strange flickerings in the sky on approach of the Spire. Wandering caravans have been waylaid and even veterans of the city vanguard have become lost, as familiar bends in the road unexpectedly point to the titanic monument. Acting Primarch Wynsal Starborn, ever wary of an attack, has challenged Pathfinder Society Venture-Captain Shevala Iorae to help Absalom's First Guard solve the mysteries of the Spire, that Starborn might lead an investigation into that baleful relic. As word of the challenge spreads, Absalom braces for the return of an ancient enemy.

Befitting a titan that profoundly impacted the history of Garund, Nex left behind a rich, if conflicted, legacy. Quantium's marvelous Bandeshar, with its floating towers and innumerable libraries, evokes the visionary who inspired generations of arcane advancement. The bleak Mana Wastes and the monstrous fleshforges of Ecanus recall the ruthless war master who spent innumerable lives in his quest for power. The grim and fantastical Spire of Nex that has loomed over Absalom for millennia is a monument to a man who challenged the gods themselves. In this fallen age, as the deepest reaches of the Bandeshar stir for the first time in ages, the many faces of Nex weigh heavily upon his people. Can this time of peace survive a living legend?
