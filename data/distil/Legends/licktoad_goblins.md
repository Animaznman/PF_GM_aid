# LICKTOAD GOBLINS

Khismar developed this unique atomizer that allows for the distribution of elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. The atomizer can hold a single elixir, oil, or potion. An atomizer contains enough reagents to use it up to 10 times before the reagents must be replaced. A new batch of reagents costs 5 gp and requires an Interact action to replace. **Activate** ![figure: black diamond with white arrow] Interact; **Effect** You spray the contents of the atomizer on yourself or an adjacent willing ally or unattended object. The target gains the effects of the applied elixir, oil, or potion. The target must be a valid target for the effect, such as food or drink for a nectar of purification, or the consumable is lost.

**Activate** ![icon: two black diamond shapes] Interact; **Effect** You cause the atomizer to mix its reagents and fire its held consumable at a square within 30 feet. The consumable forms a cloud that fills the space. The first willing valid target to enter the space automatically gains the effect of the consumable. If there are multiple valid targets, such as with multiple weapons for _aligned oil_, the creature entering the space determines how the effect is applied. The cloud is consumed upon contact with a willing valid target or at the start of your next turn, whichever comes first.

**Hype** Crookchar's most popular and profitable development is the energizing drug hype. Although Crookchar is constantly working to improve on his formula for hype, his older formula has since become replicated and more widespread. Diluted hype is common in the city of Starfall in Numeria. Hype uses the rules for drugs, found on pages 120–121 of the *Gamemastery Guide*.

LAB NOTES Deadbomb Serum Development (Corpse Heart—discontinued) The purpose of the Corpse Heart was to create a container suitable for storage within a zombie, and brittle enough to break on impact. A fascinating side effect occurred when a fire ray killed the subject. The results were described as "flaming guts punching everyone in reach." The purpose of the deadbomb serum is to deliberately recreate this flaming guts punch. This compound will serve as contents for a Corpse Heart.

LICKTOAD GOBLINS

GOBLIN ADVENTURING PARTY "Don't worry so much! I said I'd find your book and find it I will. Now you just head on over to Barberstone and have yourself a good soak; you'll feel much better for it, I'm sure." The wyrwood stood in the threshold to her office, holding the door open for a middle-aged half-elf. She watched as the visitor slowly made his way across the waiting room and gave a reassuring wave when he looked nervously back at her one last time. It was only when he had exited into the immense cavern beyond and the door had closed that she acknowledged her other guest. "All right, you, c'mon in. I've got a doozy for you."

Silka—famed recovery specialist of the Astral Plane—gestured to a chair with her wooden right hand as she walked around to the far side of her desk and pulled a folder from the top drawer with her left. "That delightful bundle of nerves was Golbert, and it seems he's lost his picture book. Let's see..." She paused for a moment to consult the page before her. "*Faire Tales of Fey Lands*. A gift from his late mother, I believe. Lots of sentimental value, and so on. Anyway, it was taken from him shortly before he was unceremoniously dumped onto this plane along with the thieves. He's made himself a tidy bundle since he arrived here in Yulgamot selling some sort of alchemical trinket to the folks passing through, and he's going to pay me a hefty sum for his lost treasure. I think this one might require a little muscle, though, and that's where you come in.

"Tell me," she said, sliding the folio across the desk as she steepled her hands, her head giving a mischievous quirk on her ball-jointed neck. "What do you know about goblins?"
