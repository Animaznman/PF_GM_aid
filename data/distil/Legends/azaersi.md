# FAMILIAR FACES General Azaersi served as the final villain of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path. Though she's a brutal tactician and a peerless warrior, _Legends_ assumes that Azaersi met her match in the commanders of the Nirmathas militia, as played by the PCs—not only did the militia rout Azaersi's Ironfang Legion, but its commanders likewise achieved the impossible, and convinced Azaersi to end her conquest of her own volition.

AZAERSI

# GENERAL OF OPRAK ## LE FEMALE HOBGOBLIN SWASHBUCKLER Feared by humans and revered by her own people, the hobgoblin General Azarersi is a living legend across Nirmathas, Molthune, and the new-forged nation of Oprak. Her name roughly translates to "Aza the Immortal," and her origins are shrouded in myth. Some say that Azarersi is the last surviving general of the Goblinblood Wars, while others insist she was the brutal Shriekwood Slayer who plundered Molthune's forests for a decade. Still other rumors claim she mastered a great god of the Darklands and chained it as her slave. Though these rumors are obviously embellished, there is a grain of truth to each. General Azarersi did fight in the Goblinblood Wars, she did raid Molthune for years, and a mighty barghest served her throughout the Ironfang Legion's campaigns. The greatest of the legends about her is the one that's entirely true: that she came from nowhere to achieve the impossible, carving out a homeland for goblinkind that shows every sign of enduring.

Azaersi began her life as a foot soldier named Aza. She was young during the days of the Goblinblood Wars, barely more than a child, and in the Valley of Iron Fangs, she saw her army utterly crushed. In that battle, humans vastly outnumbered the defending hobgoblins, and after five days of brutal fighting, they vanquished the half-starved, ill-equipped survivors of the goblin horde.

The humans offered no terms of surrender. The campaign had been long and cruel, and the soldiers on both sides had witnessed and committed such atrocities that the idea of taking prisoners was inconceivable. Thus, they slaughtered every surviving goblin and hobgoblin to the last.

Aza, too, fell in the Valley of Iron Fangs. An Eagle Knight ran the young hobgoblin through with a spear and left her lying amid the fly-speckled carrion of her people. When Aza came to, sprawled in a mass grave, her heart filled with a cold hatred unlike anything she'd ever felt before. In that moment, she renamed herself Azaersi, for the child-soldier Aza was dead, and in her place was a leader unlike anything Golarion had seen before.

Turning at first to banditry, Azaersi gathered other surviving veterans of the Goblinblood Wars and the young goblins and hobgoblins who had been orphaned by the fighting. She drilled fierceness and discipline into these ragtag survivors, and then she unleashed them upon Molthune.

# THE IRONFANG LEGION Eventually, the Molthuni army dispatched a regiment to deal with the bandits in the woods. Defying expectations, Azaersi's underfed, poorly equipped force destroyed the Molthuni regiment, and the generals of Molthune took notice. Rather than sending a larger force to stamp out Azaersi's band, the Molthuni sent a single envoy with an offer: Azaersi could sign up as one of Molthune's "monster regiments," non-human mercenary companies who could ravage Nirmathi targets when Molthune's government needed to maintain plausible deniability. Azaersi accepted, and her bandits were dubbed the Ironfang Legion. Her intention, however, was merely to use the opportunity to familiarize herself with Molthuni equipment and tactics. She also built loyalty among the other monster regiments, who soon learned to respect her ferocity and strategic acumen. When she felt she had obtained enough intelligence and had adequately equipped her soldiers with Molthuni steel, Azaersi and the Ironfang Legion quietly melted away, taking much of Molthune's mercenary strength with them.

Next, Azersi embarked on several arduous journeys to gather allies. During this time, she met and enlisted the dark naga **Zanathura** (LE female dark naga sorcerer), the ex-gladiator **Kraelos** (LE male hobgoblin dragonslayer), and the

barghest cult leader **Azlowe** (LE male greater barghest warpriest). Each of these individuals shared their talents and wisdom willingly. With them at her side as advisors, Azaersi claimed the title of general.

Finally, Azaersi infiltrated the dwarven citadel of Kraggodan, where she broke into the sacred Reliquary of Ascension and stole an artifact known as the _Onyx Key_. This artifact enabled her to create a near-impregnable stronghold and magical, ever-shifting pathways through the elemental plane of Earth—a network of "shortcuts" known as the Stone Roads. With her army prepared, Azaersi launched her campaign to establish a homeland for "monsters" such as herself, attacking first Nirmathas and then Molthune to claim the territory and resources she needed. Yet the true heart of her nation, though she did not realize it at the time, was and remains within the secret vault created by the _Onyx Key_.

The fighting was as fierce as Azaersi anticipated. What she did not anticipate was the personal cost. Several of her closest friends and longtime companions died or deserted her during the campaign. Zanathura proved treacherous, and Azlowe unreliable. Those who stayed loyal often died, sometimes at the hands of less trustworthy comrades. Though she maintained an impervious confidence in front of her troops, privately Azaersi felt the toll of these losses profoundly. Thus, when Nirmathas and Molthune jointly offered her peace terms that included recognition of Oprak as an independent nation and an adequate concession of territory to support her people, Azaersi accepted the bargain. In her heart of hearts, she was tired of fighting.

Two hobgoblin emissaries bearing shards of the _Onyx Key_—an onyx shard to Kraggodan, and a sardonyx shard to the leaders of the Nirmathas militia—signaled the end of the Ironfang Invasion.

# RISE OF A NATION General Azasersi had read enough history to know that empires built on conquest often collapse with the death of their original conqueror, and she was determined that Oprak would not succumb to this fate. She devoted her energies to nation building, aware that whether Oprak stood or fell would determine whether anyone believed that goblinkind and monstrous people as a whole could rule a unified nation at all.

Tar-Baphon's rise has, ironically, helped Azaersi solidify her position. While Nirmathas remains bitter about their losses, the nation has swallowed their enmity and sent additional envoys to General Azaersi, hoping that her formidable legions might help them defend against the Whispering Tyrant's forces. Azaersi, for her part, recognizes the extreme threat posed by Tar-Baphon, and also recognizes that the human nations' need for her armies and military leadership are an opportunity for her to improve Oprak's standing. Yet she has also taken note of the military rulers of Molthune, who are less united in their commitments to alliance and show signs of becoming problems down the road.

Partly to shore up their shared defenses against the Whispering Tyrant, and partly in service to her overarching goal of encouraging more "monster homelands" in Golarion, Azaersi has opened diplomatic channels to Ardax the White-Hair, though her stance remains cautious as she tries to feel out whether the orc overlord has enough control over his fractious holds to be worth her time. So far, Azaersi has made no formal commitments and has merely sent over a few military advisors to help the orcs organize their forces—and, of course, to report back to Oprak with their observations.

Although Azaersi's personal animosity toward humankind still burns fiercely,

# SIGNS OF STATION Azaersi sometimes rewards her agents with the right to wield one of the Ironfang Legion's coveted enchanted weapons. These weapons include the following.

Tamrakh's Fist: This +1 striking composite bow generates two explosive arrows per day. These arrows can only be shot from Tamrakh's Fist and crumble into ashes if used with any other weapon. Only two such arrows can exist at any time.

Zhentarreth: A greater flame tongue longsword, this sword is named for the red dragon whose hide binds its hilt and in whose heart the new-forged blade is said to have been quenched.

**Volukkar:** This *+1 grievous shock glaive* vanished in the Darklands along with the hobgoblin lieutenant who was carrying it. This weapon was a prize from one of the Ironfang Legion's first battles, and apart from *Volukkar*'s significant monetary value, Azaersi

cherishes it as a commemorative token of her army's origins. While she is concerned with discovering her agent's fate, she wants the glaive back even more, and any agent of hers who finds it is likely to receive the right to wield it as a reward.

**Four Claws of the Deepdread:** Finally, Azaersi may reward her favored servants with one of the *Four Claws of the Deepdread*, described on page 28.

ENTWINED DESTINIES GLOSSARY AND INDEX

# THE STONE ROADS General Azaersi has used the _Onyx Key_ to open magical pathways—the Stone Roads—into nations across Golarion. Foremost among these is the Tian hobgoblin nation of Kaoling, which offers not only rich trade, but a model of stable, long-established hobgoblin laws and society for Oprak to study and, perhaps, follow. Despite wary political relations as the distant hobgoblins take measure of each other, a busy interchange of commerce and culture already exists

between the two nations. As a rule, Azaersi focuses her efforts on non-human nations, in part because she despises humans and resents the idea of them profiting from her possession of the Stone Roads, and in part because she would prefer to use the Onyx Key to uplift other "monstrous" peoples in addition

to her own. However, because she is conscious of her need for regional allies, Azaersi could be persuaded to sell limited access to a human nation if she believed it would benefit Oprak to do so. For now,

Azaersi's efforts to negotiate the Stone Roads into advantages for Oprak are just beginning, and most have not yet borne fruit. Yet if the general can fully realize the Stone Roads' potential, then Oprak stands to command wealth and mercantile power such as the world has never seen.

she has willed herself to set that aside for the time being and has ordered her underlings to do the same. If Oprak is to last, it must have more friends and fewer enemies than it does now, and at least some of those friends will likely have to be humans. Therefore, she has negotiated non-aggression pacts with Nirmathas and Nidal, as well as entertained the presence of diplomats from the desperate Knights of Lastwall. Cheliax's reputation for treachery has made her wary, but she respects Queen Abrogail's ruthlessness and believes the empire may be a suitable ally for her goals. Meanwhile, Druma and Qadira seem like promising trade partners who might value Oprak's access to new markets through the Stone Roads. The venture currently holding much of Azaersi's interest is that of two hobgoblin alchemists who acquired the general's leave to seek training at the Citadel of the Alchemist in Thuvia. That Artokus Kirran apparently accepted the two hobgoblins as students surprised Azaersi and has earned her complete, precise attention.

# THE GENERAL'S ARMORY Azaersi believes in rewarding loyalty and service, and she is always in search of reliable and trustworthy agents. Sensible officers, clever spies, and trade negotiators who show skill at dealing with non-hobgoblins are all likely to win General Azaersi's favor, and rewards that only she can offer.
