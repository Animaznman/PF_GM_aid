# Entwined Destinies

# ENTWINED DESTINIES The NPCs presented in this book are mired in a number of plot threads, some of which are described here.

# THE ALLIANCE AGAINST TAR-BAPHON The rise of the Whispering Tyrant has forced old enemies and unlikely friends to unite under one banner, though the Living God Razmir is secretly feeding Tar-Baphon's armies with Razmiran's dead.

# THE FIGHT FOR ABOLITION Recent victories like **Wynsal Starborn**'s ban on slavery and the revolution spearheaded by rebels such as **Avarneus** and **Shimali Manux** have emboldened abolitionists around the Inner Sea region, such as Shahiyan **Deena al-Parishat**, who might be backed by her husband Satrap **Xerbytes II**. **Andira Marusek** has been preying on slaver ships from ports overseen by **Hashim ibn Sayyid**. In return, Hashim has been sending aid to Queen **Abrogail Thrune II**. The queen has also been enslaving refugees from **Tar-Baphon** and has ordered the deaths of Farmers **Magdelena and Martum Fallows**, who work with Andira to help slaves escape. The two Farmers are unwittingly compromised, as a previous Farmer was captured by Lictor **Toulon Vidoc**.

# HUNT FOR THE PRIMARCH The primarch of Absalom mysteriously vanished several years ago, forcing the ruling councils to appoint Wynsal Starborn as acting primarch until a new primarch can be elected. Wynsal would like to see the exiled Watcher-Lord Ulthun II elected to the role to help Absalom fight against Tar-Baphon, who sieged Absalom once before, and to ensure Absalom remains independent—as other candidates for the primarchy, such as those loyal to Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian, would prefer to see Absalom annexed into another nation. To add to Absalom's problems, Lictor Toulon Vidoc of the Hellknights has been fed bad evidence that Wynsal was the one who disposed of the rightful primarch, and the Order of the Scourge is now determined to investigate.

# MOTHER OF MEDICINE Kassi Aziril, a Rahadoumi student of the legendary alchemist Artokus Kirran, has been making many breakthroughs in the field of non-magical healing, with the help of a few favors from Katapesh's pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid. Kassi's work has attracted attention from High King Anong Arunak, whose homeland lies in a magic-dead zone, and Grand Vizier Hebizid Vraj, who wishes Qadira's medical schools to provide the best training possible. Kassi's outspoken atheist beliefs have alienated many, however, and Queen Abrogail Thrune II even hired the Red Mantis assassins to murder the doctor, only to be shocked when Blood Mistress Jakalyn voided the contract.

WAR IN THE NORTH Chancellor Irahai, the new leader of Mendev, aims to retake the land of the Sarkoris Scar, aided by legendary heroes such as Irabeth Tirabade and volunteers sent from the Magaambya by Janatimo. She recently received a sword from the Numerian warlord Kevoth-Kul but is uncertain whether it is a sign of alliance or a declaration of war. If Irahai investigates further, she might discover that one of Kevoth-Kul's supposed allies, Khismar Crookchar, is illicitly sending agents to plunder the treasure of Choral the Conqueror that has been mysteriously washing up on Mendev's shores.
