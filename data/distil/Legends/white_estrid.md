# White Estrid

negotiates to secure the materials and transportation they'll need for the coming war. Yet, a surfeit of doubts and guilt lies underneath his efforts. Even as Ulthun wonders if the fall of Lastwall grew out of his own shortcomings, he questions whether he still holds enough faith in Iomedae's pure ideals to see him through. But, with each dawn, Ulthun pushes past his inner turmoil, as the return of Tar- Baphon presents a threat far beyond such petty matters.

# LORD IN EXILE Though Ulthun has done his best to remain a steady pillar in these trying times, his pain, frustration, and regret are not demons that can be banished by a sword. It is clear to most of his entourage that the watcher-lord has sublimated much of his frustration into reclaiming the Precipice Quarter, using what small victories he can claim as a balm for the defeats he's suffered. Those knights closest to him worry about his psyche and health, especially after Ulthun uncovered and killed a manipulative undead creature known as a lovelorn that seemed to be drawn to him. While Ulthun tries to seek out help when the burden becomes too much, his status as a public figure in the eye of the world has left him sorely without confidants.

The current acting primarch of Absalom, Wynsal Starborn, has proven a steadfast friend in these trying times. Both men have committed their lives to military service, and more importantly, Wynsal Starborn gave Ulthun and his people a home when they came to Absalom utterly destitute. Though Ulthun genuinely cares for his brother-in-arms, he also hopes that his relationship with Wynsal will pave the way for a long-term relationship with Absalom's Grand Council. To this end, Ulthun actively wants Wynsal to remain the acting primarch or seek a full appointment as primarch of Absalom, even though he knows that Wynsal hopes to replace himself with a legitimate successor. Ironically, Wynsal seems to consider Ulthun II the ideal candidate for that replacement.

# THE LONG PATH FORWARD Ulthun devotes most of his time to mustering the strength needed to defeat Tar-Baphon. His efforts take a great number of forms, but three projects currently demand his attention in particular. Ulthun has heard of a group of survivors who have fled to the woods near Three Pines Ford. If the rumors are true, they are under the protection of the three dryad sisters that the town was named for. Ulthun is desperate to send agents to smuggle the survivors out of Three Pines Ford, and to secure the dryad sisters as allies against Tar-Baphon's forces.

Ulthun also hopes to send a contingent of soldiers to the port city Vellumis, where priestess **Aylunna Varvatos** (LG female human cleric of Iomedae) is still orchestrating evacuations to Absalom alongside volunteers from the Magaambya. While she has done well to maintain Vellumis's defensive perimeter, Ulthun hopes that, by bolstering her forces, Aylunna will be able to reclaim some of the surrounding territory from Tar-Baphon's army. This would allow Lastwall's forces to take the first steps toward establishing the forward bases and supply lines that they would need in the upcoming war.

In addition to rescuing his people, Ulthun is searching for powerful weapons to challenge Tar-Baphon's arcane might. With that in mind, he has turned his gaze to the half-sunken ruins of Beldrin's Bluff, which lie just off the coast of the Precipice Quarter. He plans to send a team of intrepid adventurers into the ruins to seek out an artifact of the legendary arcanist Beldrin, despite rumors of sea devils plundering Beldrin's fallen tower.

# ULTHUN'S PROPAGANDA Ulthun II currently serves as the locus of Lastwall's recruitment campaign. While Ulthun remains in Absalom, telling what tales he can and glad-handing who he must to continue the flow of gold and supplies to the remains of Lastwall, the knights Kalabrynne and Clarethe lomedar serve on the front lines of the battle against the Whispering Tyrant. Kalabrynne oversees the training of recruits at Vellumis, one of the few remaining cities in the nation that still stands. She works closely with her child, Clarethe, whose boldness inspires recruits and veterans alike to decisive action. As a knight-reclaimant, Clarethe is eager to take the offensive in the war against Tar-Baphon and reclaim the ruins of Vigil, a brash move that perhaps fails to perceive how dire a threat Tar-Baphon

poses to the soldiers of Lastwall. Yet Ulthun is beginning to sympathize with Clarethe's position, as his forced role as a public fundraising figure has taught him the value of a prominent victory for the rest of the world to rally around.

White Estrid

LINNORM KING OF THE IRONBOUND ISLANDS CN FEMALE HUMAN BARBARIAN Four fierce eyes survey the throne room of Halgrim, two belonging to a great crag linnorm and two belonging to an imposing woman seated in the center of a group of columns. Each column represents an island in her domain, the Ironbound Islands. Her royal regalia is cropped at the arms, revealing pale white skin and toned muscle. A powerful woman with white hair and pale blue eyes from her albinism, Estrid wears ornately decorated armor that covers her body thoroughly to protect her from the sunlight. Even her royal trappings are fashioned from thick leather, as she is perpetually ready to do battle. Her battle axe is always at her side, the hilt hewn from the dark rock of the Ironbound Islands. Banners around her hall depict sea creatures locked in combat with armored women. Claw motifs adorn her throne, as if when she presides over the hall, she does so from the fallen body of a great beast. This is the Linnorm King White Estrid, scoffed at by other Ulfen in her land, yet so far unchallenged in her rule.

As a young girl, Estrid joined a hearth with the intention of training as a warrior. During her time at the hearth, Estrid refined her skills with the sword as well as in sailing. After leading the fleet of longboats she sailed with on a great raid on the port of Nisroch in 4704 AR, Estrid broke through a blockade at the Arch of Aroden and ferried the raided treasure directly into the harbor at Absalom, the City at the Center of the World. Due to this and other exploits, Estrid gained a reputation as daring in the face of danger.

When tales of a crag linnorm taking up residence on one of the islands struck the ears of her crew, Estrid was the first to call for the anchor to be lifted, and the first to set off for the glory of the ultimate prize: the head of a linnorm. After tracking the creature to the mysterious Island of Ancestors, White Estrid battled fiercely with the linnorm **Boiltongue** (CE male crag linnorm). Yet in the final moments, instead of killing the monster, Estrid accepted the beast's plea to parlay and bound him to her service, agreeing to take Boiltongue alive as her thrall. Estrid returned to Halgrim to claim the title of linnorm king as her own, where Boiltongue stands behind her throne, a living trophy and avatar of her power. King Estrid also returned from the isle with a powerful weapon, though she will not share anything of its origin beyond that it was a gift from earth spirits that inhabit the island, making the elders of Halgrim uneasy about who or what Estrid is beholden to.

Despite her detractors, White Estrid is currently one of the longest-established linnorm kings. She rules with ferocity, and continually engages in military moves as well as diplomatic ones. She encourages agrarian pursuits, and due to the presence of Boiltongue, her farmlands are often the most secure—to her critics' chagrin. Estrid also encourages groups outside of the Ulfen to settle in her lands. Her subjects include orcs, half-orcs, and dwarves.

A nervous alliance between the western kingdoms of the linnorm kings has so far held, but the recent defeat of King **Opir Eightfingers** (CN male human barbarian) by the Runelord Belimarius and new rulers
