# ANDIRA MARUSEK

GET OUT AND VOTE! Although Andoran's citizens have more say in their fates than most, this presents Andira with a challenge that most of her fellow leaders don't have to face. Upcoming elections have forced her to juggle her current endeavors with a campaign for reelection, if she is to be able to accomplish her larger goals and make the most of her position.

ANDIRA MARUSEK

SUPREME ELECT OF ANDORAN LG FEMALE HUMAN EAGLE KNIGHT The Marusek family originally hailed from the port city of Augustana and had enough wealth to enjoy comfortable lives there. As a result, Andira grew up a happy child without wants or complaints. As a gift for her fifteenth birthday, Andira's parents paid for a voyage to Niswan in Jalmeray. A set of slaver galleys ambushed Andira's ship during her return journey, and she soon found herself the latest in a group of slaves serving as rowers. After several months Andira lost all hope of ever returning home, until a fleet of Gray Corsair ships found the trio of galleys and liberated Andira in the process. Among the Gray Corsairs was a woman named **Andira Galimnos** (LG female human Gray Corsair); the young Andira believed the fact that two shared a name to be more than mere coincidence. During the voyage home, Andira made it her goal to join the Eagle Knights to help others, much like Andira Galimnos had helped her.

# JOINING THE EAGLE KNIGHTS Upon her return to Augustana, Andira found herself immediately clashing with her parents. The Maruseks had their daughter once more, and the thought of Andira setting out to dangerous locations to fight slavers brought fear to their hearts. After months of pleading, Andira eventually received her parents' blessing and made her way to Almas to present herself at the Golden Aerie and join the Eagle Knights. The young Andira was a voracious learner, studying diplomacy, negotiation tactics, politics, and philosophy with the same zeal that she carried on the battlefield. Her expertise soon earned her a position among the Eagle Knight's Twilight Talons branch, marking her as one of the youngest Eagle Knights to do so.

Andira eventually tired of espionage and left her successful career as a spy in the Twilight Talons to better serve as a public figure to inspire others, much like Galimnos had inspired her long ago. Marusek joined the Steel Falcons, where her previous training served her well. As a result of her new position, Andira traveled farther than ever before, with easier access to ports replete with slavers. She publicly pushed for abolition when she could and boldly raided slaver galleons across the whole of the Inner Sea when policy was not enough. Her experience and success eventually earned her the title of General of the Steel Falcons. By 4716 AR, Andira had attracted the audience necessary to be voted into office as Andoran's new Supreme Elect, a position she took in 4717 AR on the eve of her 30th birthday.

# COMMANDER IN CHIEF As Supreme Elect, Andira Marusek has found herself adjusting to a life of politics, where righteousness and bold action are more often detriments than strengths. Andira believes that freeing slaves and destroying slavers shouldn't come second to the squabble of national dignitaries, but her duties have forced her to adopt a more tempered role on the world stage. Despite welcome overtures from the neighboring Grand Princess Eutropia, Andira finds that the relationship that the Andoran people have with Taldor is still strained, as Eutropia's father, Grand Prince Stavian III, still considered Andoran part of the Taldan Empire, despite being either unable or unwilling to enforce the claim.

Though on good terms with her neighbors in Kyonin, Andira is cautious to jump hastily into further relations with the elven queen, as she understands that many of Telandia's maneuvers are governed in the background by different advisors and nobles. Also, Andira strongly believes in democratic rule and is reluctant to ally too strongly with nations ruled by monarchies. Despite this, Andira works to encourage Queen Telandia's recent progressive policies, and the two have collaborated over the integration of elves and non-elves in the town of Greengold.

Andira also has an interesting relationship with Galt. Both nations were founded on the same principles, but Galt collapsed into an eternal and bloody revolution

that proved just as tyrannical as any dictator. While Andira shares her nation's caution around their former ally, she has slowly changed her position after Camilia Drannoch was named head of the Revolutionary Council. After Camilia shared her secret desire to destroy the _final blades_—the soul-trapping guillotines used to enforce the terror within Galt—Andira cemented a clandestine alliance, eventually extending the help of the Steel Falcons to aid Camilia's ultimate goal of purging Galt of its cruelties.

Relations with Andoran's western neighbor are sourer. Cheliax's extreme diabolism and the despotic rule of Queen Abrogail Thrune II repulse the Supreme Elect, as does its embrace of slavery. The people of Andoran largely echo this hostility, so when Andira took office as Supreme Elect, she inherited a country on the brink of war with Cheliax. Queen Abrogail returns the hatred with interest, and the two leaders' barely disguised contempt for one another has dragged political tensions to greater heights, culminating with Queen Abrogail placing an army of devils on the border between the two nations. With Andira unwilling to back down against this threat, the dual powers may soon erupt into violence.

WINDS OF LIBERATION Andira Marusek is among a short list of Supreme Elects, and her youth in comparison to her predecessor, **Codwin I of Augustana** (LG male human paladin of Iomedae), places an incredible pressure on her shoulders from both the people of her own nation and those neighboring. With her concrete and uncompromising opposition to slavery, Andira has found herself unofficially thrust into the role of leader of the abolitionist cause in the Inner Sea region. This has in turn garnered the attention, both positive and negative, of most neighboring nations and cities that don't enforce universal anti-slavery laws toward all ancestries.

Using her roles as a general and leader of the People's Council, Andira has the Gray Corsairs dock at foreign ports and fight slavery in locations where it is most prominent. The yellow-sailed slave ships of Katapesh are a particularly favored target; Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid seems to have given up on even token admonishments of Andoran for their sacking of such vessels. Absalom has become a favored refuge of these returning Grey Corsairs, ever since Wynsal Starborn manumitted the city slaves and subsequently banned the practice of slavery. Andoran's leaders seem to have taken this move as an implicit sign of alliance between Absalom and Andoran, though no one has been so crass as to insinuate such out loud. Andira has opted for a gentler approach when it comes to Qadira, however, hoping that the new abolitionist shahiyan, Deena al-Parishat, can sway public opinion without the need for foreign force.

Responses to Andira's abolitionist crusade vary. In Katapesh, gnolls despise the Eagle Knights and fear that the Supreme Elect will further crack down on their trade. In Cheliax, Andira is jeered as weak, and even those that share her views are not optimistic about the Supreme Elect daring to wage war for the cause of abolitionism. The people of Andoran have a somewhat opposite sense of the situation, believing that if their Supreme Elect doesn't act, Cheliax will do so first as a preventative measure against abolitionism.

Andira still believes that the best strategy toward ending slavery altogether is through calm and organized dedication toward the common goal, though she wouldn't abstain from doing so under a more forceful flag. She views the lack of faith some have regarding her leadership as a tool, rather than an obstacle, and looks forward to wielding it for her own ends.

BITTER EXPERIENCE Andira's time with the Twilight Talons saw her on countless missions beyond Andoran's borders. As part of her work, she met with Magdalena and Martum Fallows of the Bellflower Network and helped conduct several operations while in disguise. Andira's efforts continued for nearly a decade as she slowly armed herself with new, aggressive fighting techniques as well as an extensive knowledge of Bellflower poisons and medicines that derived from plants and animals. Her experience steered her in the direction of some of the harshest slave ports, where she witnessed many horrific trafficking abuses. Andira's early work with the Bellflower Network exposed her to the worst that Cheliax had to offer, especially to enslaved halflings and other non-human peoples, which only further instilled disgust for the nation and its thrice-damned leader.
