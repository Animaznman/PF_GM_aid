# SHIMALI MANUX

# MISSION OF MERCY Shimali has recently received a plea directly from Farmers Magdelena and Martum Fallows. Nestled just inside the Ravounel border, the village of Sember Cove has been struck with scarlet leprosy. A Chelaxian frigate volunteered to coordinate aid efforts, but in truth the captain is attempting to starve the town as punishment for harboring Bellflower Network sympathizers. Shimali now plots to run the blockade and deliver clerical aid.

SHIMALI MANUX

ADMIRAL OF VIDRIAN'S NAVY NG FEMALE HALF-ELF SWASHBUCKLER *With my errand complete, I took stock of my situation. I was in Eleder on the eve of revolution. I had not a dagger to my name. Night was falling, and the local marines were combing the docks for drunkards to press into service. I decided to quit the city posthaste, under any captain who would have me.*

_Said captain was Shimali Manux. My first assignment was to steal her a ship. That should give you a flavor of those wild days. Unlike today's Firebrands, Shimali was no showboater. She was daring because she had literally nothing to lose. The moonlit cutting-out expeditions? The mad duels in the ratlines? These were born of desperation and simple math: to free her country, she needed frigates. Turns out if you steal enough leaky tubs, they make you a legend._

—Excerpt from the letters of Seimon Candelar, Gray Corsair Shimali Manux's Sargavan father was a spice trader, her elven Ekujae mother his guide and translator. They had two children, Shimali and **Vulmia** (NG female half-elf navigator). The girls, fraternal twins, spent their long childhoods in both parents' spheres, learning tables and tide charts one season and jungle lore the next. But the ocean pulled at Shimali, and when they were old enough, the sisters went to sea.

Tragedy struck while they were away. Their father was blamed for missing funds and hanged, while Aspis Consortium loggers demolished their mother's village and the government stood by. Even as the sisters learned of these horrors, the sloop they served on was burned to the waterline for failing to pay a Free Captain a bribe.

Prejudice and greed had left the girls orphaned and adrift. So Shimali and Vulumia went to war.

The sisters fell in with a young Avarneus, who was equally desperate to shake off the Sargavan colonial yoke. While Avarneus remained on land, scheming from inside the government, the sisters assembled a ragtag crew of rebels, misfits, and hard-up adventurers. With Shimali taking the lead and Vulmia watching her back, they boarded ship after ship and commandeered them, striking at multiple ports simultaneously to keep harbormasters guessing. If luck turned against them, they hid in the jungle, recuperating with the Ekujae only to strike again.

Soon, the rebellion in Vidrian brought down the barony and drove the Sargavan rulers from their shores. Only at that point did the struggle at sea begin in earnest. Outraged at the loss of Sargava's tribute, the Free Captains tried to sack the new nation in recompense. Shimali had been preparing for this, and she met them with her makeshift fleet, trading blow for blow until the decks were stained with blood. But Shimali's tenacity won out, and the ragtag alliance of Senghor's navy and Shimali's stolen ships drove the Free Captains from Desolation Bay. With that triumph, Vidrian was born.

Desolation Bay. With that triumph, Vidrian was born. Since then, Shimali has been gathering allies for her fledgling country. She has made stops in every port she can, seeking introductions and promises of aid. To her relief, Absalom, Andoran, and Osirion responded positively. But her visit to Ravounel bore the most fruit. There she found a warm welcome among her fellow revolutionaries, the Silver Ravens. What began as an official pledge of mutual aid blossomed behind closed doors into a new network of freedom fighters, dedicated to fighting oppression and slavery wherever it may be found. True to their name, these Firebrands have sparked good deeds and feats of bravery across the continent, their progress aided by Shimali's swift fleet.

Today, Shimali commands Vidrian's navy. She is bemused that her reputation makes her seem a dashing figure, but she recognizes the value her legend serves Firebrand recruiters. Fortunately, legend and reality are not far apart: Shimali is a kind-hearted woman who goes out of her way to help others, and with an armada and the Firebrands at her back, she does more good than most.

# A GROWING LEGACY Shimali Manux's closest ally is her sister, Vulpia. Content to avoid politics, Vulpia serves on the Firebrand ship *Nightwave*, ensuring her twin's former rival—and current paramour—Captain **Devrin Arlos** (CG male human free captain) returns from his madcap adventures. No one knows Shimali's mind like Vulpia, which has led to trouble in recent times. Spymasters up and down the coast would pay dearly to question either sister about the other, and to date there have been two kidnapping attempts on Vulpia by enemies of Vidrian. The Firebrands dealt with these plots handily, and both Vulpia and Shimali have publicly laughed them off for the time being. Recently, the siblings have been working to stop Chelaxian ships from polluting nearby merfolk realms.

Shimali's other comrade-in-arms, Avarneus, is a member of Vidrian's ruling council. While they remain close, Avarneus sometimes frets that Shimali is still too idealistic, and that her good nature and thrill for adventure will prove her downfall. The two maintain frequent communication over Vidrian's affairs. New nations crave legitimacy, and Shimali works hard to lay the groundwork for future Vidric embassies, as well as seeking allies and fixers in foreign courts—particularly in older realms like Taldor and Qadira that are suspicious of revolutionaries.

When Shimali came petitioning Absalom for aid, she left with both diplomatic acknowledgment and a strong admiration for Wynsal Starborn. The two share a love of justice and the discomfort of being thrust into statecraft under extreme circumstances. Shimali is grateful for Starborn's advocacy when Vidrian was most vulnerable and keeps an eye out for opportunities to repay him in kind.

Nearly every Firebrand looks up to Shimali as the group's co-founder and dashing figurehead, and she counts the Silver Ravens' **Shensen** (CG female half-elf celebrity) as a dear friend. Shimali's fleet keeps the Sapphire Butterfly flitting from crisis point to crisis point—most recently smuggling escaped slaves for the Bellflower Network.

If Shimali fears anyone, it is Queen Abrogail Thrune II. To Thrune, Sargava was an upstart colony needing to be brought to heel, and Vidrian is merely a fiction. Cheliax's own revolutions have kept the monarch diverted, but it's only a matter of time before she aims her dread navy southward. Shimali is constantly looking for new maritime allies as a bulwark against this inevitability. Meanwhile, her support of the Firebrands, Ravounel, and the Bellflower Network helps keep House Thrune off balance—for now.

Yet not all of Shimali's enemies are so obvious. Two of her captains have recently been assassinated in Anthusis, Vidrian's capital. Worse yet, a broken thistle arrow shaft suggests the killer is Ekujae. Shimali refuses to believe the elves would strike out at her allies in such a way, leaving her to find investigators to unravel the mystery—and render the impartial verdict that she cannot.

PEOPLE OF NOTE Abrogail Thrune II (page 8), Avarneus (page 22), Magdelena and Martum Fallows (page 84), Sapphire Butterfly (page 94), Seimon Candelar (NG male human Gray Corsair), Tessa Fairwind (page 108), Wynsal Starborn (page 118)

# HONOR AMONG THIEVES Tessa Fairwind and Shimali have run afoul of each other numerous times—ever since Shimali nicked the Hurricane Queen's future flagship, the _Umbral Spark_, out from under one of Fairwind's lieutenants. They have had several engagements since, and each time the tides, misfortune, or magical chicanery have prevented a reckoning. Rumor has it that their antipathy has softened into grudging respect, especially as many Free Captains have found fortune and fame aiding Firebrand exploits.
