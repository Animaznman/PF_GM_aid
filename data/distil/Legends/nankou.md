# NANKOU

I was leading an expedition north to the Stormspear Mountain when we were hit by a family of yetis in a snowstorm, and I was sure that a couple of us weren't going to be making it home. Out of nowhere, arrows starting punching through the monsters, and a one-eyed bear came tearing out from the snow. I learned two things that day: there are archers good enough to shoot through a blizzard, and Nankou of Icemark is a good friend to have. –Svala Ice-Rider, Varki ranger

NANKOU

# LINNORM KING OF ICEMARK ## NG MALE HUMAN RANGER Born in the taiga of Icemark, Nankou's life started bitterly. His tribe was slaughtered by one of the fearsome draconic creatures known as a linnorm on the day of his birth. His pregnant and wounded mother, Ninnok (N female human hunter), fled as her fellow tribe members died, frantically running to secure a small piece of their future. Ninnok managed to survive giving birth in the desolate taiga, then carried her infant one desperate mile after another until she collapsed near Seer's Home, a settlement serving as home to the elders of all Varki tribes. Ninnok was cared for by the elders, though the trauma and tragedy she had endured left her quiet and withdrawn. Nankou grew up raised on the collected stories, knowledge, and wisdom of all the Varki tribes while learning to hunt and fish to provide for his mother.

While hunting shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Nankou encountered a newborn black bear, mewling and blind-eyed as it cuddled against its mother's torn and half-eaten corpse. Nankou felt an instant affinity for the tiny creature whose birth seemed so akin to his own, and he adopted the bear cub, naming it T'kamo. Nankou and T'kamo grew strong and powerful together, for Nankou's skillful archery and knowledge of medicine and woodcraft were well complemented by T'kamo's implacable strength and patience.

Over the decades of their adventures together, Nankou and T'kamo became folk heroes for the Varki of Icemark. Born to a dead tribe and raised by the elders of all tribes, Nankou was welcome among almost all of the Varki tribes, and the earnest young man was happy to repay each tribe's hospitality. Hunting, slaying beasts and monsters, or relaying word of events affecting the region to Varki who lived far from trade routes, Nankou's reputation grew to precede him wherever he went. Varki tribes quarreling with their Ulfen neighbors would seek out the young Varki for mediation; Nankou's skill in Skald, the Ulfen tongue, and his naturally quiet demeanor made him an excellent diplomat.

As several unusually harsh winters in a row drove the nomadic Varki tribes closer to their Ulfen neighbors, Nankou began to see increasingly dangerous interactions between the Varki and Ulfen. The two peoples had coexisted for so long in part due to the rarity of their crossings, and as they found themselves in increasingly close contact, misunderstandings like lopsided trade agreements threatened to undermine the longstanding peace. It was then that Nankou truly understood exactly what it was he had been born for.

Taking up his bow and with T'kamo at his side, Nankou returned to the frozen woodlands of his birth, seeking the creature that had slain his tribe so long ago. Nankou and T'kamo fought a fearsome battle from which neither warrior escaped unscathed. Nankou gave an eye, and T'kamo one as well, along with his fore-claw, but in the end they returned to Seer's Home bearing the head of a mighty taiga linnorm. Nankou declared himself the linnorm king of Icemark and decreed that he must ratify all trade agreements. Since the Varki do not enter into formal trade agreements with each other, this functionally made Nankou the primary diplomat for his people with the Ulfen, whose awe at the Varki's proven claim to the title of linnorm king has smoothed relations between the peoples significantly.

# KING OF THE TAIGA Nankou's position as the only Varki linnorm king sets him apart from almost everyone in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Varki and Ulfen alike. The Varki love him but see him as much as an extension of the Varki people as an individual. The Ulfen respect his skill as a warrior, but otherwise aren't quite sure what to make of him. Nankou enjoys the solitude of his unique position.

Despite his relatively recent claim to the title of linnorm king, Nankou has surprisingly good relationships with some of his nearby monarchs. White Estrid

has sent multiple diplomats to Icemark since Nankou claimed the throne, though the emissaries have often found themselves indulging in Icemark's hospitality for months while waiting for Nankou to return from the tundra. White Estrid's detractors have on more than one occasion tried to use this eagerness to disparage her, but in the face of Estrid's far greater heresy of keeping a linnorm as a pet, these attempts have usually fallen flat on their face.

Nankou also considers himself friendly with Thira Ash-Eyes, the successor to and daughter of longstanding Linnorm King **Sveinn Blood-Eagle** (CN male human barbarian). When Sveinn sailed off to Valenhall, most of his fractious children quarreled in the streets of Kalsgard, while young Thira instead hewed to the traditions of her people and set out to slay a linnorm. A practitioner of arcane magic, Thira was often overlooked and underestimated by other Ulfen, despite her skill with a blade. As she trekked out into the wilderness between Icemark and the Thanelands, she encountered Nankou in his wanderings. Already a linnorm king by this point, Nankou recognized the young warrior's aspirations and shared a fire and a meal with her. Thira claimed her own linnorm and the throne that went with it, and still remembers the Varki ranger fondly. Nankou hopes this meeting will help to strengthen the relations between the Ulfen of the Thanelands and the Varki of Icemark.

Not all of Nankou's neighbors are so pleasant. King **Ingimundr the Unruly** (CE male human barbarian) of nearby Broken Bay is notably old-fashioned and even more notably quarrelsome. Ingimundr's open encouragement of raiding remains one of Nankou's pressing threats. Though the Ulfen king claims distance from those ships who plunder other Linnorm Kingdoms, it is well-known that he also turns a blind eye to them, and Nankou's proximity no doubt marks him as an attractive target.

# THE HUNTER Nankou loves nothing so much as hunting deadly monsters. While he bears great respect for the wildlife of Icemark, he ruthlessly exterminates unnatural creatures that undermine the delicate ecosystems of his territory. Nankou has a particular hatred for taiga linnorms, and occasionally seeks out others to help him hunt the deadly beasts down. After losing an eye and taking on a deadly curse during the fight that made him a linnorm king, Nankou is not so prideful as to insist that he meet other linnorms in single combat. When Nankou can't find a group of adventurers willing to assist him in a linnorm hunt, he takes special precautions, laying elaborate traps and finding just the right environs to prepare for the battle before settling in to wait for as long as is required. Nankou and his black bear companion T'kamo possess deep wells of patience and are said to have killed more linnorms than the one he keeps at Seer's Home to ratify his claim to the title of linnorm king. Those who would hunt a linnorm would do well to accept Nankou's assistance if it is offered. picture: The lower right of the image contains a close-up of a bear's face, with one eye missing and a visible scar. The bear's mouth is slightly open, showing its teeth. The image is cropped so that only the head and part of the neck are visible. The bear appears to be Nankou, as described in the text.

Nankou constantly wanders the taiga and tundras of Icemark, occasionally slipping over the borders into his neighbors' domains. Any group that dares to travel the uncharted lands would find that the one-eyed Varki with the one-eyed bear might very well be the friendliest encounter they can expect in those environs, so long as they treat the ranger, his bear, and the Varki people with respect.

# WORDS OF THE KING Linnorm king is a silly title. I have never once had a single linnorm bow in obeisance to me or even pay my words any heed. But there is power in words, and in the meaning people invest them with. Scarcely a handful of years past my people were on the brink of war with the Ulfen, with scarce food and grim winters driving us inexorably towards a conflict that held only despair for both sides. Then I slew a great beast and called myself its king, and peace became a possibility where before we had no hope. So I shall be a linnorm king and allow those words to define me in the eyes of strangers, for doing so has given me Ulfen brothers and sisters where once only enemies stood before me. –Nankou of Icemark
