LILY Members of the Bellflower Network and their allies must often remain subtle when helping slaves escape. To aid in their efforts, the Bellflower Network has developed a system to deliver secret messages using quilts. These quilts bear specific designs to notify Bellflower tillers and those they guide of any important information. Members hang these quilts from porches, windows, and clotheslines where tillers and other travelers can see them. Most quilts bear flowers, as they are inconspicuous and are instantly recognizable to other Bellflower agents. A common pattern is that of the lily. The flower warns of an upcoming crossroads, which may be heavily traveled. The background pattern's colors are used to indicate danger, with warmer colors suggesting higher risk.

SUNFLOWER Most halflings see sunflowers as good omens as they are able to find the sun, regardless of where it may rest in the sky. As a result, quilts bearing sunflowers are used to indicate a safe house. While these safe houses are not the Bellflower barns run by members of the Network, they are run by individuals sympathetic to the Bellflower's cause. A traveler that recognizes the quilt can knock on the home's door, ask for directions to the "Turning Theater"—a reference to the halfling goddess Chaldira. Those in the know can then respond "How would you perform?" Responding with the phrase "Why, with all my buttons!" in halfling completes the exchange. The keeper of the home typically invites the traveler in, though typically through a back door or side door to avoid suspicion.

# BLUE DAISY Daisies are used in several Bellflower quilts. Most daisies signal nothing and are in fact used as decoys and red herrings. A Bellflower member might own dozens of daisy quilts used to hide the presence of actual signal quilts. A clothesline with a white daisy quilt at each end indicates false signal quilts meant to throw trackers off the scent of travelers. A blue daisy is the only daisy with significance. It's used to notify allies of the Bellflower Network that a tiller will be arriving soon with travelers in tow. The number of flowers indicates the days of travel until the arrival and the state of bloom indicates how prepared the group is. A barely blooming daisy notes that the group will need lots of rations, medicine, tools, and other aid.

LOTUS A quilt with a lotus signifies safe passage over water. This might suggest a ferry that transports anyone, no questions asked, or a Bellflower contact that has some means of transport available. The lotus petals also suggest preferred times for passage. A white lotus notes passage available primarily near dawn, while pink and violet lotuses indicate passages at dusk or during the night respectively. Finally, the flower's state of bloom can notify of danger. A fully bloomed lotus announces safe passage while even a single closed lotus on the quilt indicates that travelers should be cautious as there are eyes around that might report suspicious activity. Most of these quilts feature several lotuses to more easily hide a closed lotus.

LEGENDS INTRODUCTION A–G H–M N–Z ENTWINED DESTINIES GLOSSARY AND INDEX

I was leading an expedition north to the Stormspear Mountain when we were hit by a family of yetis in a snowstorm, and I was sure that a couple of us weren't going to be making it home. Out of nowhere, arrows starting punching through the monsters, and a one-eyed bear came tearing out from the snow. I learned two things that day: there are archers good enough to shoot through a blizzard, and Nankou of Icemark is a good friend to have. –Svala Ice-Rider, Varki ranger

NANKOU

# LINNORM KING OF ICEMARK ## NG MALE HUMAN RANGER Born in the taiga of Icemark, Nankou's life started bitterly. His tribe was slaughtered by one of the fearsome draconic creatures known as a linnorm on the day of his birth. His pregnant and wounded mother, Ninnok (N female human hunter), fled as her fellow tribe members died, frantically running to secure a small piece of their future. Ninnok managed to survive giving birth in the desolate taiga, then carried her infant one desperate mile after another until she collapsed near Seer's Home, a settlement serving as home to the elders of all Varki tribes. Ninnok was cared for by the elders, though the trauma and tragedy she had endured left her quiet and withdrawn. Nankou grew up raised on the collected stories, knowledge, and wisdom of all the Varki tribes while learning to hunt and fish to provide for his mother.

While hunting shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Nankou encountered a newborn black bear, mewling and blind-eyed as it cuddled against its mother's torn and half-eaten corpse. Nankou felt an instant affinity for the tiny creature whose birth seemed so akin to his own, and he adopted the bear cub, naming it T'kamo. Nankou and T'kamo grew strong and powerful together, for Nankou's skillful archery and knowledge of medicine and woodcraft were well complemented by T'kamo's implacable strength and patience.

Over the decades of their adventures together, Nankou and T'kamo became folk heroes for the Varki of Icemark. Born to a dead tribe and raised by the elders of all tribes, Nankou was welcome among almost all of the Varki tribes, and the earnest young man was happy to repay each tribe's hospitality. Hunting, slaying beasts and monsters, or relaying word of events affecting the region to Varki who lived far from trade routes, Nankou's reputation grew to precede him wherever he went. Varki tribes quarreling with their Ulfen neighbors would seek out the young Varki for mediation; Nankou's skill in Skald, the Ulfen tongue, and his naturally quiet demeanor made him an excellent diplomat.

As several unusually harsh winters in a row drove the nomadic Varki tribes closer to their Ulfen neighbors, Nankou began to see increasingly dangerous interactions between the Varki and Ulfen. The two peoples had coexisted for so long in part due to the rarity of their crossings, and as they found themselves in increasingly close contact, misunderstandings like lopsided trade agreements threatened to undermine the longstanding peace. It was then that Nankou truly understood exactly what it was he had been born for.

Taking up his bow and with T'kamo at his side, Nankou returned to the frozen woodlands of his birth, seeking the creature that had slain his tribe so long ago. Nankou and T'kamo fought a fearsome battle from which neither warrior escaped unscathed. Nankou gave an eye, and T'kamo one as well, along with his fore-claw, but in the end they returned to Seer's Home bearing the head of a mighty taiga linnorm. Nankou declared himself the linnorm king of Icemark and decreed that he must ratify all trade agreements. Since the Varki do not enter into formal trade agreements with each other, this functionally made Nankou the primary diplomat for his people with the Ulfen, whose awe at the Varki's proven claim to the title of linnorm king has smoothed relations between the peoples significantly.

# KING OF THE TAIGA Nankou's position as the only Varki linnorm king sets him apart from almost everyone in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Varki and Ulfen alike. The Varki love him but see him as much as an extension of the Varki people as an individual. The Ulfen respect his skill as a warrior, but otherwise aren't quite sure what to make of him. Nankou enjoys the solitude of his unique position.

Despite his relatively recent claim to the title of linnorm king, Nankou has surprisingly good relationships with some of his nearby monarchs. White Estrid
