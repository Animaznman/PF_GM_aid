# MAGDELENA AND MARTUM FALLOWS

Reta Bigbad NE FEMALE GOBLIN FIGHTER Distinctive Features: Unusually large, wide head; wears stolen bridal veil Other Relationships: Spotol (pet toad) Typical Behavior: Hits things hard with a sword, a stick, or anything else close at hand; fights particularly viciously against dogs; very loud, usually shouting; easily bored

# KNOWN HISTORY These four goblin troublemakers began life in the Licktoad tribe, in a small village, in a small swamp, in a small corner of Golarion, on the Material Plane. How they got from there to here is a tale of violence, destruction, and an uncanny amount of good fortune for the goblins themselves. Goblin history is hard to come by, writing being a terrible sin to them and all, but I've managed to piece together a little bit of it for you.

Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta made a name for themselves at a young age by raiding a wedding, eating the cake, and stealing a piglet (more on the pig shortly). Once established as warriors for their tribe, they were free to cause all sorts of trouble. One particularly daring and destructive raid left a notorious goblin cannibal dead and the four returning to their tribe as conquering heroes with a load of fireworks. Alas, the explosive fun was not to last long for the Licktoads—the tribe was wiped out shortly afterward by adventurers from a nearby human settlement.

Even when luck ran out for the tribe, though, it held strong for this destructive quartet, who managed to be away on a mission at the time. They quickly found a new home with a nearby tribe, the Birdcrunchers, who just so happened to be in want of some heroes to take care of a pesky ogre problem. They drove off the interloping monster and his fire-breathing pigs, and even managed to rescue their former tribe's prized mascot, a war-pig named Squealy Nord—you guessed it, the very one they stole as whelps. On their return they were crowned chieftains and settled in for the life of luxury they knew they deserved.

This, too, was not to last. Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta were bored by life as chiefs—ordering raids is much less fun than participating in them, it seems. Thus, when their favorite pig disappeared into a mysterious magic bag, they jumped right in after him. They found themselves in a strange demiplane resembling the inside of a huge bag, accidentally created by and inhabited by the son of one of their early victims. After rescuing Squealy Nord—now alchemically altered into a large porcine dragon—they pierced the side of the bag and were dumped along with the rest of its contents onto the Astral Plane.

As always seems to be the case, their luck was astoundingly good. Rather than get lost in the immeasurable and featureless expanse of the plane, they stumbled almost immediately onto our fair city. We know they were here for a while, at least, because they were chased out of the Preserve after a "misunderstanding" regarding the flammability and edibility of the lichen gardens. Rumor has it Barberstone Spa took the unusual step of completely draining and thoroughly scrubbing their big pool the other day as well, though they're being tight lipped about it, and I can't help but think that's related. Given the recent uptick in theft and vandalism in the area, as well as rumors of strange pirates attacking passersby, it seems likely they're still here. I suspect they're hiding out down in Underpeak, staring at that beautiful view of the Plane of Fire and plotting their next mischief. It's hard to know exactly what they're planning, but given their history it will probably involve the violent acquisition of something shiny, flammable, or both. It shouldn't be too hard to track them down, but be careful when you do; they're tougher than they look!

Lick the toad and steal the cake, Crunch the bird and ruckus make, Kill the ogre, smash his head, We be goblins, you be dead!

We big chiefs and we be bored, Off to find our Squealy Nord, Into Baglands, smash the place, Ride our dragon into space!

This place boring, it so drab, There be nothing fun to stab, We have new prize to acquire, We make raid on Plane of Fire!

**YULGAMOT** The city of Yulgamot hangs in the timeless expanse of the Astral Plane, settled on a rocky planetoid large enough to sustain a constant

population. Also known as the Calendar Stone due to the fact that the timeless nature of the plane is suspended within the city environs, Yulgamot is a popular travel point for explorers who otherwise lack stable landmarks or layover points in the void of the Astral. While the upper side of Yulgamot faces a starry void and is host to strange gardens that grow in the violet light, the lower side of Yulgamot faces the Plane of Fire and is baked clean of most life. The view from that side is beyond spectacular, however—especially for creatures with a fondness for flame!

# NOTABLE TILLERS The Bellflowers have had several tillers work to aid escaped slaves. The following are some of the more famed tillers. **Jonival Mortems (NG male halfling legislator):** After years as a tiller, Jonival entered Andoran politics and now furthers abolitionist causes on the People's Council. **Lost Voice (CN nonbinary human vigilante):** This mysterious tiller travels throughout Avistan, moving from barn to

barn to help reunite liberated slaves who had become separated.

Nolly Peltry (CG female halfling tiller): This tiller adopted the name of the folk hero from The Peltry Fables and coordinates tillers from her home of Kintargo.

MAGDELENA AND MARTUM FALLOWS

FARMERS OF THE BELLFLOWER NETWORK CG FEMALE AND MALE HALFLING ROGUE For a society such as the Bellflower Network, its members rely on secrecy, and none more so than the Farmer. As the figure serving as the head of this abolitionist organization, concealing the Farmer's identity is paramount. If a Farmer is captured alive and forced to reveal information, the network would collapse. Diplomatic relationships across Golarion would likely follow, as it would reveal every nation that clandestinely supports the Bellflowers.

But the current Farmer has worked to limit the damage should such an event occur, for at the moment, there isn't one Farmer, but two. Magdelena and Martum Fallows are twins who have worked undercover for the past few years, ensuring that halfling slaves across Cheliax are given every chance to experience freedom.

EARLY YEARS Years ago, a young halfling named Hamir Fallows fell in love with Mariana Covon, a slave serving a sentence for thievery in central Cheliax. When their courtship began, Hamir was free, while Mariana served a cruel mistress named Madam Parisa. Soon, Mariana was expecting, and Hamir decided that the life of a slave was no life for his love or his future child.

Hamir attempted to earn Mariana's freedom, even offering to pay Madam Parisa a great amount, far more than the value of a halfling slave in Cheliax. Parisa did not accept any terms Hamir proposed, however, and Chelaxian law was of no assistance to Hamir. He eventually grew desperate and infiltrated Madam Parisa's estate in an attempt to liberate Mariana. The attempt was an outright failure. Hamir faced off with Parisa's guards, and the fight culminating in a great fire in Madam Parisa's manor. From cellar to roof, the estate went up in flames, and neither Hamir nor Parisa were ever heard from again. Mariana was quickly captured and transferred to a new owner to continue her sentence. Several months later, Mariana gave birth to twins she named Magdelena and Martum. Born into slavery, their new master took a semblance of pity and permitted them to remain together. In childhood, Magdelena exhibited an aptitude for nimbleness like her mother, while Martum seemed the spitting image of a father they never knew. Together, they contributed to the fulfillment of their mother's sentence, adding their years to her time served.

# HARVEST MOON After their mother's master died from a local plague, a nephew of their deceased master inherited the twins and promptly rewrote the terms of their enslavement. Instead of serving the Fallows family sentence concurrently, each of them had to serve the years separately. This effectively doubled their remaining sentence.

News of this legal trickery soon reached the ears of the Bellflower Network, who began observing the plantation. Early reports described the young Magdelena as a natural hunter, but predisposed to thieving, while Martum learned how to manage the plantation finances. Both got along well with their fellow halflings but harbored a burning hate for their owner. At age 14, agents witnessed an escape attempt that ended in the twins' capture and punishment. These reports quickly reached Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist), who investigated the matter and learned something surprising: her deceased nephew, Hamir Fallows, was the father of the twins.

As their grandaunt, Hannelore personally undertook the task of freeing them. On the eve of their fifteenth birthday, Hannelore approached Magdelena and

Martum in the dead of night and promised to lead them to safety. They accepted and disembarked on their Harvest Moon—the beginning of their road to freedom.

## BECOMING THE FARMER After their escape from the plantation, Farmer Hannelore helped the twins flee all the way to the Cheliax border. On their own merit, Magdelena and Martum avoided capture multiple times, and Hannelore became a parental figure along the way. However, she never revealed to them that she was their grandaunt, fearing that their familial connection could compromise the Bellflower Network.

When the pair reached the Aspodell Mountains on their way to Andoran, yet another surprise awaited them: a crop of halflings who'd been captured by Chelaxian patrols, their Bellflower agent handler killed. Together, they neutralized the patrol, and by the end of the night, the twins were leading their very first crop to freedom. After this incident, Hannelore knew that her nephew's twins seemed fated to aid the Bellflower Network. When they approached her to join up, she happily accepted, and together, the three of them returned to Cheliax.

As the years passed, both Magdelena and Martum proved to be prodigies. At night, no challenge couldn't be overcome by Magdelena, while Martum's sliver tongue could talk him out of any situation. These talents turned them into underground folk heroes, earning Magdelena the alias of "Belltower," and Martum the alias of "Sunflower." Both of them would eventually partake in the rebellion that freed Ravounel from Chelaxian control, cementing this legend among halflings across the continent.

But five years ago, Farmer Hannelore disappeared. Her allies feared her capture, but after two years passed and Bellflower operations continued without disruption, it's assumed that an accident resulted in her death, her body never discovered. Although they are young, the Fallows twins have stepped up to lead the Bellflower Network in Hannelore's place. In doing so, they are guiding the next generation of agents, and their aliases have generated tales of hope across the continent.

# BELLFLOWER OPERATIONS In their home country of Cheliax, Magdelena serves as the tactical mastermind of the operation. Her work has secured safe houses, enabled rebellions, and helped Bellflower agents spirit countless halfling slaves to freedom. Both home and abroad, Martum is the political agent, securing funds from rich and influential people who seek the end of slavery. They share the responsibilities of the Farmer well, though they haven't been spotted in the same region for over a year.

After having mixed success in Ravounel, the twins began to work apart and developed some bad habits on their own. Most notably, the emboldened Magdelena is taking unnecessary risks, while soft-spoken Martum is out of practice when it comes to freeing slaves in person. Their outlooks have changed too: Magdelena is hopeful that she'll live to see the end of halfling enslavement, while Martum is a pragmatist and expects to serve as Farmer for the rest of his days. His increasing role as the face of the Bellflower Network is only encouraged by his sister.

Today, as the Whispering Tyrant gains power, Magdelena constantly faces the dilemma of spiriting halflings out of Nidal. To the east, undead forces threaten every nation within the Eye of Dread. Some druidic or warrior halflings do request passage through Molthune to Nirmathas, but it's a risky route that Magdelena loathes. Meanwhile, from afar, Martum has built a communication system with flowered quilts. Its colors and flower types allow agents to guide each other through locales that were once too dangerous, mitigating any risk with various warning signs.

# INSULT TO INJURY In recent times, Ravounel has emerged as an independent and free nation, and during the rebellion, the twins established a strong Bellflower presence there together. Unfortunately, slave-hunters now earn steady incomes illegally by kidnapping and enslaving halflings—even ones who were never slaves to begin with.

LEGENDS INTRODUCTION A–G H–M N–Z ENTWINED DESTINIES GLOSSARY AND INDEX

# BELLFLOWER SAFE HOUSES A number of safe houses, known as "barns" among members of the Bellflower Network, dot Cheliax. Ranging from abandoned barns to public taverns, each one possesses their own codeword for entry, which is known only to the agents that lead halflings in and out. Hosts, or "hands," manage the hidden spaces where halflings eat, sleep, and wait for their next escort, or "tiller." Some of the safe houses are listed below.

**Abandoned Parisa Estate:** Located near Whisperwood, west of Senara. *Codeword:* Firestorm

Egorian Rose Fields: Located just outside the capital of Egorian. *Codeword:* Thorn Weeds

**Menador Patrol House:** Located near the Ravounel and Nidal borders, these soldiers are defying the Chelaxian state. *Codeword:* Merciful Deeds

**Nile's Harborside Warehouse:** Located in Ostenso, right on the docks. *Codeword:* Vignette

**Collapsed Church of Iomedae:** Located near Westcrown, a fire collapsed it during the Glorious Reclamation. *Codeword:* Unmasking

Vann's School for Young Adults: Located in Senara, south of city center. Codeword: Evermore The Wicked Fork: Located in the West Drenches district of Corentyn. Codeword: Garden View

While the twins are on good terms with each other, their time apart has begun to turn them into strangers. Their differing tactics and outlooks have started to divide their agents. In an era of growing peril, this puts the Bellflower Network at major risk.

# HANDY EQUIPMENT In service to the Bellflower Network, Magdelena, Martum, and their agents use a variety of alchemical items, some more specialized than others. The Farmers share the formulas for those items only with those agents whom they work with directly, as they are cautious to trust those beyond that circle with their secrets.

ITEM 10

HONEYCENT RARE ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE INHALED POISON Price 180 gp Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L Activate Interact

This sweet-scented poison triggers vivid hallucinations in those who succumb to it, causing most to believe swarms of ravenous biting insects are feeding on them. So vivid are these hallucinations that the victims damage themselves by scratching and clawing at the imaginary swarm. At the GM's discretion, a creature incapable of clawing at itself might instead slam against solid objects, in which case the poison inflicts bludgeoning damage.

Saving Throw DC 30 Will; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 2d6 slashing damage (1 round); Stage 2 2d6 slashing damage and stupefied 1 (1 round); Stage 3 2d6 slashing damage, drained 1, and stupefied 1

SWAMP LILY QUILT ITEM 3 RARE ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE Price 12 gp Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2

This quilt is defined by its green lily-pad pattern, which is rare in Bellflower communications. The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain. Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground.
