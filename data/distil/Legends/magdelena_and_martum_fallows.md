# MAGDELENA AND MARTUM FALLOWS

# NOTABLE TILLERS The Bellflowers have had several tillers work to aid escaped slaves. The following are some of the more famed tillers. **Jonival Mortems (NG male halfling legislator):** After years as a tiller, Jonival entered Andoran politics and now furthers abolitionist causes on the People's Council. **Lost Voice (CN nonbinary human vigilante):** This mysterious tiller travels throughout Avistan, moving from barn to

barn to help reunite liberated slaves who had become separated.

Nolly Peltry (CG female halfling tiller): This tiller adopted the name of the folk hero from The Peltry Fables and coordinates tillers from her home of Kintargo.

MAGDELENA AND MARTUM FALLOWS

FARMERS OF THE BELLFLOWER NETWORK CG FEMALE AND MALE HALFLING ROGUE For a society such as the Bellflower Network, its members rely on secrecy, and none more so than the Farmer. As the figure serving as the head of this abolitionist organization, concealing the Farmer's identity is paramount. If a Farmer is captured alive and forced to reveal information, the network would collapse. Diplomatic relationships across Golarion would likely follow, as it would reveal every nation that clandestinely supports the Bellflowers.

But the current Farmer has worked to limit the damage should such an event occur, for at the moment, there isn't one Farmer, but two. Magdelena and Martum Fallows are twins who have worked undercover for the past few years, ensuring that halfling slaves across Cheliax are given every chance to experience freedom.

EARLY YEARS Years ago, a young halfling named Hamir Fallows fell in love with Mariana Covon, a slave serving a sentence for thievery in central Cheliax. When their courtship began, Hamir was free, while Mariana served a cruel mistress named Madam Parisa. Soon, Mariana was expecting, and Hamir decided that the life of a slave was no life for his love or his future child.

Hamir attempted to earn Mariana's freedom, even offering to pay Madam Parisa a great amount, far more than the value of a halfling slave in Cheliax. Parisa did not accept any terms Hamir proposed, however, and Chelaxian law was of no assistance to Hamir. He eventually grew desperate and infiltrated Madam Parisa's estate in an attempt to liberate Mariana. The attempt was an outright failure. Hamir faced off with Parisa's guards, and the fight culminating in a great fire in Madam Parisa's manor. From cellar to roof, the estate went up in flames, and neither Hamir nor Parisa were ever heard from again. Mariana was quickly captured and transferred to a new owner to continue her sentence. Several months later, Mariana gave birth to twins she named Magdelena and Martum. Born into slavery, their new master took a semblance of pity and permitted them to remain together. In childhood, Magdelena exhibited an aptitude for nimbleness like her mother, while Martum seemed the spitting image of a father they never knew. Together, they contributed to the fulfillment of their mother's sentence, adding their years to her time served.

# HARVEST MOON After their mother's master died from a local plague, a nephew of their deceased master inherited the twins and promptly rewrote the terms of their enslavement. Instead of serving the Fallows family sentence concurrently, each of them had to serve the years separately. This effectively doubled their remaining sentence.

News of this legal trickery soon reached the ears of the Bellflower Network, who began observing the plantation. Early reports described the young Magdelena as a natural hunter, but predisposed to thieving, while Martum learned how to manage the plantation finances. Both got along well with their fellow halflings but harbored a burning hate for their owner. At age 14, agents witnessed an escape attempt that ended in the twins' capture and punishment. These reports quickly reached Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist), who investigated the matter and learned something surprising: her deceased nephew, Hamir Fallows, was the father of the twins.

As their grandaunt, Hannelore personally undertook the task of freeing them. On the eve of their fifteenth birthday, Hannelore approached Magdelena and

Martum in the dead of night and promised to lead them to safety. They accepted and disembarked on their Harvest Moon—the beginning of their road to freedom.

## BECOMING THE FARMER After their escape from the plantation, Farmer Hannelore helped the twins flee all the way to the Cheliax border. On their own merit, Magdelena and Martum avoided capture multiple times, and Hannelore became a parental figure along the way. However, she never revealed to them that she was their grandaunt, fearing that their familial connection could compromise the Bellflower Network.

When the pair reached the Aspodell Mountains on their way to Andoran, yet another surprise awaited them: a crop of halflings who'd been captured by Chelaxian patrols, their Bellflower agent handler killed. Together, they neutralized the patrol, and by the end of the night, the twins were leading their very first crop to freedom. After this incident, Hannelore knew that her nephew's twins seemed fated to aid the Bellflower Network. When they approached her to join up, she happily accepted, and together, the three of them returned to Cheliax.

As the years passed, both Magdelena and Martum proved to be prodigies. At night, no challenge couldn't be overcome by Magdelena, while Martum's sliver tongue could talk him out of any situation. These talents turned them into underground folk heroes, earning Magdelena the alias of "Belltower," and Martum the alias of "Sunflower." Both of them would eventually partake in the rebellion that freed Ravounel from Chelaxian control, cementing this legend among halflings across the continent.

But five years ago, Farmer Hannelore disappeared. Her allies feared her capture, but after two years passed and Bellflower operations continued without disruption, it's assumed that an accident resulted in her death, her body never discovered. Although they are young, the Fallows twins have stepped up to lead the Bellflower Network in Hannelore's place. In doing so, they are guiding the next generation of agents, and their aliases have generated tales of hope across the continent.

# BELLFLOWER OPERATIONS In their home country of Cheliax, Magdelena serves as the tactical mastermind of the operation. Her work has secured safe houses, enabled rebellions, and helped Bellflower agents spirit countless halfling slaves to freedom. Both home and abroad, Martum is the political agent, securing funds from rich and influential people who seek the end of slavery. They share the responsibilities of the Farmer well, though they haven't been spotted in the same region for over a year.

After having mixed success in Ravounel, the twins began to work apart and developed some bad habits on their own. Most notably, the emboldened Magdelena is taking unnecessary risks, while soft-spoken Martum is out of practice when it comes to freeing slaves in person. Their outlooks have changed too: Magdelena is hopeful that she'll live to see the end of halfling enslavement, while Martum is a pragmatist and expects to serve as Farmer for the rest of his days. His increasing role as the face of the Bellflower Network is only encouraged by his sister.

Today, as the Whispering Tyrant gains power, Magdelena constantly faces the dilemma of spiriting halflings out of Nidal. To the east, undead forces threaten every nation within the Eye of Dread. Some druidic or warrior halflings do request passage through Molthune to Nirmathas, but it's a risky route that Magdelena loathes. Meanwhile, from afar, Martum has built a communication system with flowered quilts. Its colors and flower types allow agents to guide each other through locales that were once too dangerous, mitigating any risk with various warning signs.

# INSULT TO INJURY In recent times, Ravounel has emerged as an independent and free nation, and during the rebellion, the twins established a strong Bellflower presence there together. Unfortunately, slave-hunters now earn steady incomes illegally by kidnapping and enslaving halflings—even ones who were never slaves to begin with.

# BELLFLOWER SAFE HOUSES A number of safe houses, known as "barns" among members of the Bellflower Network, dot Cheliax. Ranging from abandoned barns to public taverns, each one possesses their own codeword for entry, which is known only to the agents that lead halflings in and out. Hosts, or "hands," manage the hidden spaces where halflings eat, sleep, and wait for their next escort, or "tiller." Some of the safe houses are listed below.

**Abandoned Parisa Estate:** Located near Whisperwood, west of Senara. *Codeword:* Firestorm

Egorian Rose Fields: Located just outside the capital of Egorian. *Codeword:* Thorn Weeds

**Menador Patrol House:** Located near the Ravounel and Nidal borders, these soldiers are defying the Chelaxian state. *Codeword:* Merciful Deeds

**Nile's Harborside Warehouse:** Located in Ostenso, right on the docks. *Codeword:* Vignette

**Collapsed Church of Iomedae:** Located near Westcrown, a fire collapsed it during the Glorious Reclamation. *Codeword:* Unmasking

Vann's School for Young Adults: Located in Senara, south of city center. Codeword: Evermore The Wicked Fork: Located in the West Drenches district of Corentyn. Codeword: Garden View

While the twins are on good terms with each other, their time apart has begun to turn them into strangers. Their differing tactics and outlooks have started to divide their agents. In an era of growing peril, this puts the Bellflower Network at major risk.

# HANDY EQUIPMENT In service to the Bellflower Network, Magdelena, Martum, and their agents use a variety of alchemical items, some more specialized than others. The Farmers share the formulas for those items only with those agents whom they work with directly, as they are cautious to trust those beyond that circle with their secrets.

ITEM 10

HONEYCENT RARE ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE INHALED POISON Price 180 gp Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L Activate Interact

This sweet-scented poison triggers vivid hallucinations in those who succumb to it, causing most to believe swarms of ravenous biting insects are feeding on them. So vivid are these hallucinations that the victims damage themselves by scratching and clawing at the imaginary swarm. At the GM's discretion, a creature incapable of clawing at itself might instead slam against solid objects, in which case the poison inflicts bludgeoning damage.

Saving Throw DC 30 Will; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 2d6 slashing damage (1 round); Stage 2 2d6 slashing damage and stupefied 1 (1 round); Stage 3 2d6 slashing damage, drained 1, and stupefied 1

SWAMP LILY QUILT ITEM 3 RARE ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE Price 12 gp Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2

This quilt is defined by its green lily-pad pattern, which is rare in Bellflower communications. The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain. Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground.

LILY Members of the Bellflower Network and their allies must often remain subtle when helping slaves escape. To aid in their efforts, the Bellflower Network has developed a system to deliver secret messages using quilts. These quilts bear specific designs to notify Bellflower tillers and those they guide of any important information. Members hang these quilts from porches, windows, and clotheslines where tillers and other travelers can see them. Most quilts bear flowers, as they are inconspicuous and are instantly recognizable to other Bellflower agents. A common pattern is that of the lily. The flower warns of an upcoming crossroads, which may be heavily traveled. The background pattern's colors are used to indicate danger, with warmer colors suggesting higher risk.

SUNFLOWER Most halflings see sunflowers as good omens as they are able to find the sun, regardless of where it may rest in the sky. As a result, quilts bearing sunflowers are used to indicate a safe house. While these safe houses are not the Bellflower barns run by members of the Network, they are run by individuals sympathetic to the Bellflower's cause. A traveler that recognizes the quilt can knock on the home's door, ask for directions to the "Turning Theater"—a reference to the halfling goddess Chaldira. Those in the know can then respond "How would you perform?" Responding with the phrase "Why, with all my buttons!" in halfling completes the exchange. The keeper of the home typically invites the traveler in, though typically through a back door or side door to avoid suspicion.

# BLUE DAISY Daisies are used in several Bellflower quilts. Most daisies signal nothing and are in fact used as decoys and red herrings. A Bellflower member might own dozens of daisy quilts used to hide the presence of actual signal quilts. A clothesline with a white daisy quilt at each end indicates false signal quilts meant to throw trackers off the scent of travelers. A blue daisy is the only daisy with significance. It's used to notify allies of the Bellflower Network that a tiller will be arriving soon with travelers in tow. The number of flowers indicates the days of travel until the arrival and the state of bloom indicates how prepared the group is. A barely blooming daisy notes that the group will need lots of rations, medicine, tools, and other aid.

LOTUS A quilt with a lotus signifies safe passage over water. This might suggest a ferry that transports anyone, no questions asked, or a Bellflower contact that has some means of transport available. The lotus petals also suggest preferred times for passage. A white lotus notes passage available primarily near dawn, while pink and violet lotuses indicate passages at dusk or during the night respectively. Finally, the flower's state of bloom can notify of danger. A fully bloomed lotus announces safe passage while even a single closed lotus on the quilt indicates that travelers should be cautious as there are eyes around that might report suspicious activity. Most of these quilts feature several lotuses to more easily hide a closed lotus.
