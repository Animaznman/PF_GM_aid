# IRABETH TIRABADE

# FAMILIAR FACES Irabeth and Anevia Tirabade served as soldiers of the Fifth Crusade in the events of Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path. Standing alongside the mythical heroes who slew the demon lord Deskari and closed the Worldwound–as played by the PCs–*Legends* assumes these stalwart companions saw their cause triumph and their war end before retiring to what was meant to be a peaceful life on Irabeth's family farm.

# Irabeth Tirabade ## RENOWNED HEROINE OF THE WORLDWOUND LG FEMALE HALF-ORC PALADIN One of the greatest heroes of the Fifth Mendevian Crusade is the half-orc Irabeth Tirabade, paladin of Iomedae, former knight of the Eagle Watch, and onetime ruler of Drezen. After a storied career in the final crusade of Queen **Galfrey** (LG female herald of Iomedae) to close the Worldwound, Irabeth retired with her wife **Anevia Tirabade** (NG female human rogue) to rural Mendev, where they rebuilt a modest home on her parents' old farmstead a few days' ride east of Kenabres. There, life had been comfortable—but Irabeth remained plagued by a nagging guilt that she had abdicated her duty and now works actively for the benefit of the people trying to reclaim the demon-scarred north.

# BORN OF TWO WORLDS Irabeth Tirabade was born to loving, affectionate, and protective parents who instilled a strong sense of self-worth in their daughter from a young age, as they knew that a half-orc child would face more than her share of headwinds in life. Retired crusaders themselves, they also passed their faith in Iomedae down to their daughter. Thus was Irabeth's life shaped by two strong forces: a fierce sense of self-respect and a deep, reverent righteousness.

Irabeth spent her early life trying to find her place in the world. She went first to Lastwall, but the Lastwall's knights' long and bitter wars against the orcs of Belkzen fostered an abiding antipathy toward anyone of orcish descent. As a result, Irabeth found neither friendship nor professional advancement, purely due to her parentage, and she left disheartened. This youthful disillusion was traumatic and lasting: even today, with Lastwall fractured and desperate after the Whispering Tyrant's rise and more sympathetic leaders such as Kalabrynne Iomedar heading day-to- day operations, Irabeth hesitates to return to them. There are other causes and needs in the world that call out for Irabeth's heroism.

After leaving Lastwall, Irabeth journeyed to the River Kingdoms, where she spent several years righting small wrongs and bringing bandits and scoundrels to justice. To this day, Irabeth is fondly remembered by those she helped find a modicum of justice in a rough-and-tumble land. Some of her old comrades continue to operate as bounty hunters and magistrates across the River Kingdoms.

**LOVE AND LOSS** While working in the River Kingdoms, Irabeth met Anevia, her future wife. Raised as a man, Anevia had been living as a woman for years. The two journeyed to Kenabres together. Upon arrival, Irabeth learned that her parents had come out of retirement to re-join the Mendevian Crusade, and that both of them had died in the notorious Eagle Rock massacre.

The loss nearly unmoored her, and only Anevia's love kept Irabeth grounded. In gratitude, when she'd overcome her grief, Irabeth proposed to her lover and presented Anevia with an elixir that would change her physical form to match her identity. Irabeth never told Anevia that she'd sold her father's sword to fund the transformation, but this secret eventually came out when the sword was recovered from the evil cultists that had bought it from an unscrupulous merchant without Irabeth's knowledge.

Although this outcome was unforeseeable, it briefly cast a pall over their joy, as Anevia wrestled with feelings of unexpected guilt that Irabeth had let her father's sword slip away to secure her happiness. However, after its recovery, the sword

was wielded by a succession of champions who brought great honor to Mendev, which reassured both Irabeth and Anevia that perhaps all of this had been part of Iomedae's design. Today, Irabeth carries her father's sword with her, waiting to find the next promising champion to wield it in Iomedae's name.

Soon after Irabeth and Anevia married, they found themselves caught up in world-shaking events. Irabeth rose to renown after a series of heroic successes, culminating with a period of service as steward of Drezen under Queen Galfrey's command. She continued to serve in the crusade until it ended in victory and the Worldwound's closure. Feeling that her work was finally done, Irabeth retired with Anevia to her parents' old farmstead, to live out their lives together in peace.

# NO REST FOR THE RIGHTEOUS For several years, the couple lived happily in their modest home, tending to their fields and fostering orphaned children and youth in need of guidance. Their farm became a haven for many young people who felt ill at ease in society. Irabeth's half-orc heritage and Anevia's struggles with her identity had left both of them with deep understanding and compassion for others trying to find their way, and using her heroic reputation to inspire and minister to such aching souls satisfied Irabeth's need to help. Several of these youths, who consider themselves Irabeth and Anevia's adopted children, went on to join righteous causes throughout the northlands.

In time, however, Irabeth felt the call to return to the battlefield. Word of the Sarkorian tribes' efforts to reclaim their long-lost homeland from the demon-blighted wastes of the former Worldwound had spread across Mendev. It struck a chord with Irabeth, who had done exactly that in restoring her parents' farm. Leaving their homestead in their adopted children's hands, Irabeth and Anevia returned to Mendev and the lands of their old crusade.

Although Chancellor Irahai—an old friend and respected comrade of both women—has subtly pressed Irabeth to take greater control of the rebuilding of Mendev, neither Irabeth nor Anevia has shown any inclination to do so. Irabeth feels strongly that the Sarkorians should decide the agenda for the reclamation and views her proper role as protecting and supporting their efforts without compromising their self-determination. She is acutely aware that some southern crusaders were dismissive, even cruel toward the indigenous peoples, and she feels a need to atone for their excesses. Irabeth has worked closely with the Uzunjati spellcasters in the area, serving as guardian to the Magaambyan envoys when she can, but keeps her distance from their work, even after their repeated requests. Irabeth is content to lead warriors against demons on the ground, and Anevia has mostly acted in support roles behind the scenes. Neither woman wants to play politics in the Sarkoris Scar.

How long Irabeth will continue to serve, however, remains uncertain. Her parents died after returning to their crusade after a period of retirement, and the ghost of that loss still hangs heavy over both Irabeth and Anevia. Irabeth can't bear the thought of inflicting similar pain on her loved ones, but in her darker moments, she wonders whether such suffering is inevitable. Perhaps it is the fate of all Iomedae's champions to fall, someday, in the field.

And some of her old enemies continue to lurk in the periphery of her life, plotting revenge, such as the vivisectionist **Yurvak the Gut-Braider** (CE male half-fiend alchemist). While not even Yurvak would be foolish enough to strike directly at a paladin as formidable as Irabeth, he is hardly above hurting her by more oblique means. Yurvak recently learned of Irabeth's return to the Sarkoris Scar, and it has occurred to him that the demons of the frigid north may be able to do what he can't—if only he can find some way to help them.

# THE TRIALS OF IRABETH During the Fifth Crusade, Irabeth fought alongside some of the greatest heroes ever known. Though she lacked the mythical power these heroes wielded, Irabeth was able to hold her own against the Worldwound's harshest environments and fiercest demons. Ever since, rumors have persisted among the surviving crusaders that Irabeth's role in closing the Worldwound served as her ascension, and that she now holds the same power as those great heroes.
