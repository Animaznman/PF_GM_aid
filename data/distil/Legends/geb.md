# GEB

# QUIET NEIGHBORS Despite the malicious nature of most of its leadership, the nation of Geb has mainly been a peaceful one since the end of the war with Nex, showing no signs of expansion and only retaliating if provoked. After four centuries of calmly trading food for goods with other nations, even the most murderous Gebbite blood lords had grown used to the situation, and are now uneasy at the current change.

GEB

# GHOST KING LE MALE HUMAN GHOST NECROMANCER It is difficult to tell the story of the necromancer Geb without chronicling his centuries-long feud with the archmage Nex. The two great wizards of the Age of Destiny had no peer save one another, and so their proximity fostered rivalry, their rivalry gradually turned to obsession, and their obsession bloomed into all-out war. They unleashed unfathomable calamities against each other's nations to further their battle, permanently devastating the surrounding landscape with magical fallout.

Eventually, Geb gained the upper hand by casting forth a great storm of poison on the capital of Nex, killing thousands. In the aftermath, there was no sign of Geb's rival archmage, who had escaped into a magical refuge only to vanish from Golarion entirely. While history claimed this as Geb's victory, it rang hollow to the necromancer, who believed Nex had not only survived his final attack but was merely biding his time until the chance came to retaliate. Geb scoured the globe for any power that would let him discover Nex's true fate, until he drove himself into despair with his own paranoia and finally took his own life. Yet even death could not deny Geb's vendetta; consumed by anguish and surrounded by necromancy, his suicide trapped his spirit on the Material Plane as a ghost. With no purpose and no escape, Geb languished on the throne of a kingdom he felt no affection for. Many of his subjects chose to follow Geb into undeath, leaving him with the rotting corpse of the nation he had founded. His only relief came in the form of tiny sparks of emotion across the ages, when it seemed something might challenge him. When the Holy Knights of Ozem attacked his kingdom, he retaliated by stealing the corpse of their god's deceased herald, Arazni, and turning her into his undead queen regent. When the armies of Holomog marched on Geb's borders, he unleashed a spell that turned every warrior to stone and rained down a cataclysm on their capital city. No matter how many potential rivals rose against him, none could withstand even his opening salvo. Each time he dashed a new foe, he sank deeper into despair, unmoved by opponents that lacked even a fraction of Nex's power.

With the lich Queen Arazni running the day-to-day affairs of the nation, Geb retreated further into seclusion. Generations passed between sightings of the necromancer, and for many, it seemed best to ignore him and hope that he would waste away if left alone. Even many of the undead citizens of Geb preferred the efficient—if occasionally vindictive—rule of the enslaved Arazni to the erratic and violent whims of their king. In this age of relative peace, Geb nearly achieved true political significance on the world stage, despite the many nations unwilling to deal with undead as equals.

That all changed the day Nex's great engines of war, the fleshforges, began to activate on their own. Mighty beasts and monsters more powerful than anything the arclords had summoned in over a thousand years marched south into the Mana Wastes. They were the most wondrous sight Geb had seen since the height of the war. The day Geb had yearned for over countless lifetimes had finally come, and it was time to assemble his forces once again. Now, for the first time in 4,000 years, Geb faces new challenges. During his long wallowing fits, the ghost king failed to notice Arazni's steadily growing independence or even her sudden disappearance as Tar-Baphon stirred far to the north. Without the lich queen, Geb is forced to step forward and act like a true ruler once again. For a war council, he has only his scheming, sycophantic governors, the blood lords, many of whom have taken

Arazni's defection as a cue to turn upon each other in efforts to gain Geb's favor. His greatest difficulty comes from the very magic that reanimated him, however, as Geb's spirit is bound to the soil of Mechitar, the capital city where his palace rests. Until he can deal with these obstacles, Geb won't be truly ready for Nex's return.

# MARCH TO WAR For the first time in thousands of years, Geb is truly taking stock of his country. In doing so, he discovered that at least three cities, including a necropolis that once held the greatest school of necromancy in all of Geb, have been completely wiped from the map. Some of his more astute subjects have deduced that these locations were taken into the Hao Jin Tapestry but were not restored with the return of the Ruby Phoenix. Geb has sent a small group of ambassadors to the city of Goka to negotiate the return of the necropolis or, failing this, demand the aid of Hao Jin herself as compensation for its loss.

Far to the north, Camilia Drannoch of Galt has been in secret negotiations to rid her country of their *final blades* once and for all. While many have expressed interest in destroying the blades to free the souls trapped within, Geb is more interested in reforging the blades themselves into horrific cleavers to arm his graveknight generals. Since the country of Geb grows far more food than its few living citizens need, it is in an excellent position to bargain with the starving rebels of Galt.

While the dwarven Sky Citadel of Dongun Hold was little more than a footnote in the first war with Nex, this time Geb has been forced to take notice of the dwarven kingdom and the thriving city-state growing in its shadow. With the firearms of Alkenstar and the technological secrets of Dongun Hold, an alliance with High King Anong Arunak is something Geb now sees as in his best interests. Even if the dwarves ultimately prove of little use, snatching away one of Nex's presumed allies would be an amusing preamble to the coming war.

In a desperate bid to free himself of whatever power keeps him trapped in Mechitar, Geb has invited necromancers, clerics of death, mediums, and all manner of occultists to the capital in hopes that one of them will be able to solve the mystery of his curse. Despite his mastery of necromancy, he seems unable to recognize his own nature as a ghost as the culprit of his imprisonment; his suicide and subsequent revival are scars on his memory that he struggles to piece together. He has offered all manner of rewards for anyone who can aid him or, for the more reluctant, a cell in his dungeon until a solution has been found.

While some scramble to choose a side in the looming war, many more wish to stop it before it can even begin, including ambitious liches and vampires who have no desire to play pawns in a ghost king's war games, arclords who will lose all status and authority if Nex returns, and thousands of innocent bystanders who would be caught in the crossfire. Adventurers, pathfinders, and mercenaries all across the Impossible Lands have been hired in secret to find some way to preserve peace. Some of Geb's more traitorous governors plot the ghost king's assassination, ready to claim the throne for themselves, while others seek heroes who can find a way to prevent Nex from ever returning at all. Yet these agents must act with care: there will be no mercy for anyone who denies Geb his chance to face his old foe once again.

# ACADEMIC PRESSURE Geb seeks new weapons, advantages, and allies to prepare himself for the impending war, especially any that might have extraplanar magic or abilities. He has pushed for greater arcane developments from the various necromantic colleges throughout Geb, such as the Mortuarium in the city of Yled.
