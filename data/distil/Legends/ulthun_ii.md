# Ulthun II

networks, earn the trust of the populace, and never flinch from bringing wrongdoers to justice. At the same time, he cultivated grateful nobles throughout Chelaxian society, ensuring a certain level of autonomy and protection for his investigators.

His career has been burnished by his Order's successes. Five years ago, Vidoc secretly captured the Bellflower Network's previous leader, Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist). The hellspawn Hellknight **Jheraal** (LN female tiefling^APG human hellknight) solved a series of unsettling murders in Westcrown, ultimately tracing them to agents of the graveknight Order of the Crux. Master of Blades **Uldrannas Haelcant** (LG male human hellknight) continues to pursue a 40-year-old ring of necromantically influenced organ harvesters and kidnappers. Though he has not succeeded in apprehending its ringleaders, he has greatly diminished its activity.

The Order of the Scourge, under Lictor Vidoc's guidance, has also taken a passing interest in the disappearance of Absalom's primarch, Lord **Gyr of Gixx** (N male human rogue), and the appointment of Wynsal Starborn as acting primarch in Gyr's place. The Hellknights' interest is to ensure that Absalom continues to run smoothly, as the city-state is too important a trading power to be allowed to slip into chaos.

Vidoc's accomplishments unsurprisingly drew the attention of Queen Abrogail II of Cheliax. While Vidoc had so far managed to maneuver around Abrogail's interest in him—an interest he believes may have bordered on the romantic more so than the political—he recently earned her scrutiny due to Order of the Scourge's investigation into the queen herself. The Order posits that Abrogail may have had a hand in Cheliax's recent turmoil for political or financial gain. News of Abrogail's attempts to hire Blood Mistress Jakalyn to dispatch the queen's enemies, potentially including members of the Order of the Scourge, have only pushed this investigation to the Order's highest priority. Vidoc has halted the investigation for the moment as he considers his strategy, but stirrings throughout the Order of the Scourge suggest that the Hellknights will not be daunted by Abrogail and the investigation will be moving forward. A conflict between these powers seems near inevitable.

# OLD FAVORS A peculiarity of Toulon Vidoc's early career was his lack of interest in claiming credit for his successes. It was the work itself that absorbed him, not the acclaim that followed. While Vidoc was quick to volunteer for the hardest cases, he was also happy to let other dottari claim credit for the apprehensions. These

traits made him invaluable to many of Egorian's ambitious young officers, who lacked his skills but had the right names for promotion. To this day, many senior officers in Egorian's dottari owe their positions

to Toulon Vidoc, who earned the laurels that they've been resting on ever since. While Vidoc has never actually threatened to expose such

frauds, these senior dottari are acutely aware that he could, and as such, they have a strong interest in accommodating Vidoc's requests.

# ENTERTAINING THE MASSES Watcher-Lord Ulthun personally vouched for all of his goblin retainers upon arriving in Absalom, resulting in a minor scandal among Absalom high society. Yet the scandal was so minor and amusing it has caused many residents of Absalom to view goblins as curiosities–which, while not ideal, is still better than as threats. It also gained Ulthun a cadre of curious and loyal Absalom goblin volunteers, though how helpful many of them are is debatable.

# ULTHUN II WATCHER-LORD IN EXILE LG MALE HUMAN PALADIN The destruction of Lastwall sometimes reminds Ulthun of his family's origins. His grandparents fled from the horrific violence of the priests of Zon-Kuthon in Nidal, arriving in Lastwall as refugees. They laid down roots in Vigil, and Ulthun was born there in 4690 AR. From an early age, Ulthun nurtured a passion for literature and history. But after forming a habit of defending other children from bullies, Ulthun grew certain that it was the duty of the powerful to protect the vulnerable. He then dedicated himself to becoming one of Lastwall's crusaders and a paladin of Iomedae, the goddess of righteous valor, justice, and honor.

In 4709 AR, however, his plans were eclipsed. Though Ulthun was only 19, the Precentors Martial of Vigil's War College elected him as the watcher-lord of Lastwall. Despite his youth, his tours of service in Belkzen proved Ulthun's unparalleled commitment to the crusaders' virtues. For the subsequent decade, Ulthun led his people with the backing of his advisors in the Precentors Martial. The people of Lastwall celebrated Ulthun as a measured ruler dedicated to social advancement and vigilant defense of Lastwall's borders. Though still a romantic at heart, Ulthun refrained from mingling with the suitors that flocked in Castle Overwatch's courtyard to vie for his attention.

During the tenth year of Ulthun's rule, Lastwall faced a calamity. In 4719 AR, Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, broke free from his prison in Gallowspire. Craving vengeance against the nation that oversaw his imprisonment, Tar-Baphon detonated a shard of the Shield of Aroden in Vigil, vaporizing the capital city in an instant, then set his hordes of undead across the entirety of Lastwall. Ulthun fought valiantly alongside the crusaders that had once trained him, intending to die with his old comrades in accordance with the vows of self-sacrifice he had made to Iomedae over a decade past. But a group of humble goblins convinced Ulthun to stand down, begging for his help to save their tribe from the undead. Recognizing the goblins would die without someone to help them flee to safety and knowing that many knights would be too clouded by prejudice to offer assistance, the encounter reminded Ulthun that his greater duty was to his suffering people—no matter what form they took. Ulthun fled his collapsing nation with the goblins and his remaining knights at his side, vowing to one day return, bring an end to Tar-Baphon, and rebuild his home.

Almost a year has passed since the fall of Lastwall. After months of journeying, the last watcher-lord arrived in Absalom empty-handed, just as his grandparents had once arrived in Lastwall. The government of Absalom welcomed Ulthun with open arms, allowing Ulthun to establish a makeshift embassy in the Precipice Quarter, a neighborhood that had been nearly annihilated by an earthquake. Ulthun now works to revitalize the Precipice Quarter, building a community for refugees grieving the loss of their home. With each passing week, more newcomers arrive, all seeking to assist the survivors of Lastwall.

The displaced ruler now gathers his strength in preparation for the reclamation of his nation. Ulthun provides shelter to other refugees, spins stories to win over new allies, and
