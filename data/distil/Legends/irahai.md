# IRAHAI

was wielded by a succession of champions who brought great honor to Mendev, which reassured both Irabeth and Anevia that perhaps all of this had been part of Iomedae's design. Today, Irabeth carries her father's sword with her, waiting to find the next promising champion to wield it in Iomedae's name.

Soon after Irabeth and Anevia married, they found themselves caught up in world-shaking events. Irabeth rose to renown after a series of heroic successes, culminating with a period of service as steward of Drezen under Queen Galfrey's command. She continued to serve in the crusade until it ended in victory and the Worldwound's closure. Feeling that her work was finally done, Irabeth retired with Anevia to her parents' old farmstead, to live out their lives together in peace.

# NO REST FOR THE RIGHTEOUS For several years, the couple lived happily in their modest home, tending to their fields and fostering orphaned children and youth in need of guidance. Their farm became a haven for many young people who felt ill at ease in society. Irabeth's half-orc heritage and Anevia's struggles with her identity had left both of them with deep understanding and compassion for others trying to find their way, and using her heroic reputation to inspire and minister to such aching souls satisfied Irabeth's need to help. Several of these youths, who consider themselves Irabeth and Anevia's adopted children, went on to join righteous causes throughout the northlands.

In time, however, Irabeth felt the call to return to the battlefield. Word of the Sarkorian tribes' efforts to reclaim their long-lost homeland from the demon-blighted wastes of the former Worldwound had spread across Mendev. It struck a chord with Irabeth, who had done exactly that in restoring her parents' farm. Leaving their homestead in their adopted children's hands, Irabeth and Anevia returned to Mendev and the lands of their old crusade.

Although Chancellor Irahai—an old friend and respected comrade of both women—has subtly pressed Irabeth to take greater control of the rebuilding of Mendev, neither Irabeth nor Anevia has shown any inclination to do so. Irabeth feels strongly that the Sarkorians should decide the agenda for the reclamation and views her proper role as protecting and supporting their efforts without compromising their self-determination. She is acutely aware that some southern crusaders were dismissive, even cruel toward the indigenous peoples, and she feels a need to atone for their excesses. Irabeth has worked closely with the Uzunjati spellcasters in the area, serving as guardian to the Magaambyan envoys when she can, but keeps her distance from their work, even after their repeated requests. Irabeth is content to lead warriors against demons on the ground, and Anevia has mostly acted in support roles behind the scenes. Neither woman wants to play politics in the Sarkoris Scar.

How long Irabeth will continue to serve, however, remains uncertain. Her parents died after returning to their crusade after a period of retirement, and the ghost of that loss still hangs heavy over both Irabeth and Anevia. Irabeth can't bear the thought of inflicting similar pain on her loved ones, but in her darker moments, she wonders whether such suffering is inevitable. Perhaps it is the fate of all Iomedae's champions to fall, someday, in the field.

And some of her old enemies continue to lurk in the periphery of her life, plotting revenge, such as the vivisectionist **Yurvak the Gut-Braider** (CE male half-fiend alchemist). While not even Yurvak would be foolish enough to strike directly at a paladin as formidable as Irabeth, he is hardly above hurting her by more oblique means. Yurvak recently learned of Irabeth's return to the Sarkoris Scar, and it has occurred to him that the demons of the frigid north may be able to do what he can't—if only he can find some way to help them.

# THE TRIALS OF IRABETH During the Fifth Crusade, Irabeth fought alongside some of the greatest heroes ever known. Though she lacked the mythical power these heroes wielded, Irabeth was able to hold her own against the Worldwound's harshest environments and fiercest demons. Ever since, rumors have persisted among the surviving crusaders that Irabeth's role in closing the Worldwound served as her ascension, and that she now holds the same power as those great heroes.

# A CHANGING GOVERNMENT Irahai was quick to establish the Mendevian Delegation, a group of officials that represent the interests of Mendev's citizens who help establish, enact, and enforce new laws and regulations. With the delegation in place, Irahai's next goal is to assemble the Sarkorian Council, a group of clan leaders that advise in matters affecting the people of Sarkoris.

# CHANCELLOR OF MENDEV NG FEMALE HUMAN POLITICIAN Born to Thuvian crusaders who answered the call to combat the Worldwound, Chancellor Irahai has deep roots in Mendev and personal ties to the region's tumultuous, demon-scarred recent history. Although her parents were determined to keep Irahai from joining the front lines, she knew from childhood that she wanted to contribute to the war effort. Having grown up among soldiers, Irahai learned the crucial importance of sound logistics from a young age and became a highly capable administrator. When the Worldwound was finally closed, Irahai was the obvious choice to take over Mendev's provisional government: Queen Galfrey (LG female herald of Iomedae) named Irahai chancellor before ascending, leaving the transition to a civilian structure in Irahai's hands.

Chancellor Irahai's personal background has given her an abiding respect for the courage and sacrifices of the crusade. She views rebuilding Mendev's strength as crucial to honor the crusade's work, and she is determined to uphold her duties with integrity. Her experience with demonic schemes has proven invaluable in achieving this goal, for she has recognized and countered several subtle, fiend-driven plots to corrupt the budding civilian nation.

Additionally, many of the contacts Irahai developed during her work with the crusaders have proved useful in her new role as head of the provisional government. Among the chancellor's many friends and former comrades is the renowned Irabeth Tirabade, famous for helping close the Worldwound. Chancellor Irahai greatly respects the crusader's heroism and is keenly aware of the potential political value of Irabeth's return to the Sarkoris Scar for the effort to reclaim Sarkoris from the remaining demon armies. Although Irahai strives not to meddle in Irabeth's decisions, she does continually calculate their effect on her plans.

The alchemist Artokus Kirran is another of Irahai's correspondents. After Mendev twice won the bidding for the sun orchid elixir to rejuvenate Queen Galfrey—a project that Irahai handled personally—the chancellor sent a letter of thanks to the famous recluse. Somewhat to Irahai's surprise, the alchemist responded, and the two began a regular exchange of letters. She enjoys his letters not only for their practicality and insight, but because they often help her understand curious phenomena discovered in the Sarkoris Scar; Kirran's personal musings also grant Irahai a window into the Thuvian homeland she never knew.

Most of the chancellor's attention, however, is focused closer to home. Much of Mendev's wealth was held in trust by crusader lords, and one of Irahai's biggest and most vexing tasks is the reapportionment of those interests to their rightful, indigenous owners. However, after so much time and tumult, identifying the proper heirs is difficult, particularly given the lack of surviving written records, inheritors' intermarriage with crusaders, the disqualifying effect of demonic corruptions, and conflicts between Mendevian and Sarkorian rules of inheritance.

# SINS OF THE PAST Irahai's unfamiliarity with a scattered and reforged Sarkorian culture has exacerbated her problems. Despite good intentions, the chancellor has occasionally relied on untrustworthy intermediaries. In some cases, she has also been blind to the nuances of ancient, complicated grievances between rival clans—many of whom share common ancestors, and thus have competing claims to the same holdings. Early missteps, alongside the misdeeds of the Mendevian crusaders, have cost her credibility. Though she would dearly like to find someone patient and impartial to help her avoid further errors and make amends for past ones, Chancellor Irahai still lacks a reliable guide through the thickets of interclan disagreement.

The most grievous of her errors on this front was trusting the Sarkorian shaman **Lokhallat the Wanderer** (NE male human shaman), who advanced
