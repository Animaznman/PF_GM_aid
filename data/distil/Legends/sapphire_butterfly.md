# FRIENDS AND FOES OF THE FAITH As the head of his own religion, Razmir has few friends. His foes weigh far more heavily on the Living God's mind.

Artokus Kirran, the Thuvian alchemist, has long been brewing a precious sun orchid elixir that can return any imbiber to youth. After Razmir's winning bid on the elixir was fraudulently rejected—at least, in his own mind—rumors hold that Razmir has sent a number of agents of Thuvia to either steal the recipe for the elixir or perhaps even kidnap the alchemist.

Razmir technically remains at war with the elven nation of Kyonin, though the ruler seems to have little interest in actually pursuing any battles with his neighbors. Yet Queen Telandia Edasseril's policy of allowing fleeing citizens of Razmiran into Kyonin, so long as they aren't Razmir's priests, has recently resulted in turmoil along the two nations' shared borders. In addition to refugees being attacked by cultists intent upon showing defectors the error of their ways, Queen Telandia suspects that Razmir may have sent infiltrators to weaken Kyonin for some unknown purpose—or simply out of spite.

No one is a bigger threat to Razmir's rule than the Whispering Tyrant. Freed from his prison under Gallowspire, Tar-Baphon is now rebuilding his fortress on the Isle of Terror, making his return an existential threat to all those who border Lake Encarthan. Not long after the Tyrant's return, Razmir sent a herald to the Isle with an offer of nonaggression. The herald returned, now a wraith wearing the mask of Razmir's faith, accepting the offer with one condition: Razmiran would tithe its dead to the Tyrant, at least 1,000 bodies per month, to maintain the peace. No one knows if the Living God accepted these terms, but as of yet there has been no fighting between the two. The Pale Mask, as the herald has come to be known, still resides in Thronestep and can be found wandering the city at night. Yet Blood Mistress Jakalyn of the Red Mantis Assassins recently announced that someone had paid for a contract to be placed on Tar-Baphon, and discovered that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. It's uncertain whether the missive was from Razmir himself, an acolyte who overstepped, or an enemy hoping to gain Razmir the wrong sort of attention, and just as uncertain is what might result from a clash between any of these three powers.

# THE UNMASKED SERVANT Countless servants and sycophants are found among the ranks of Razmir's priesthood, and many of these are important to the operation of his kingdom and religion. Most of Razmir's

faithful prefer to maintain their anonymity behind the masks that they wear, but not **Vilnaria Tyn**, the Red Coin (LE female human cultist). Her mask is cracked down one side, missing from the nose down, revealing

part of her face. Vilnaria serves as Razmir's personal enforcer, rooting out the unfaithful and punishing any who dare to displease the god. Anyone unfortunate enough to receive her red

coin has 1 day to make amends for their transgressions or face her wrath. On more than one occasion, Vilnaria has left the remains of those who failed to appease her out in public for all to see, as a warning to those who would dare to defy Razmir.

# HELLSPAWN IN CHELIAX Tieflings can face prejudice from many sources due to their association with fiends, but ironically, one of the places they are most despised is the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. Though citizens pay homage to the devil Asmodeus, society believes any relations with lesser devils should be one with the mortal firmly in command–tieflings are seen as a sign of a lapse in judgment and a corruption of a mortal bloodline.

SAPPHIRE BUTTERFLY

INFAMOUS REBEL VIGILANTE CG FEMALE TIEFLING 4TH HUMAN BARD The Night of Ashes changed everything for Vyvienne Ashurka. Before the sudden and brutal crackdown on dissidents against House Thrune, Vyvienne had been intensely focused on her career as an actor and singer in Kintargo's robust theater scene, hoping to achieve something like the fame of her favorite opera star, Shensen (CG female half-elf celebrity)—and hoping to keep her tiefling heritage forever concealed. She had been fortunate in both respects, steadily landing roles and easily using her magical powers to disguise the orange-tinged fur and yellow eyes that she owed to a rakshasa progenitor. She had left the slums of northern Westcrown behind for this opportunity, making the arduous journey to Kintargo with only her sister—they had left home after the death of their parents, who were slaughtered along with the other members of the Bastards of Erebus tiefling gang. Vyvienne was thus no stranger to violence and loss. But as dawn rose following that particularly blood-soaked night in Kintargo, as the flames still sputtered and the cries rose over Shensen's disappearance, Vyvienne felt the smoldering hate that she harbored for House Thrune burst into insatiable flames.

It didn't take her long to find and join Shensen's revolutionary friends, the Silver Ravens. In searching for her idol, who was later rescued by heroes, Vyvienne quickly learned the worth of infiltration and espionage. Already adept at disguise, Vyvienne further learned its value as she crafted an alter ego, a new hero named the Sapphire Butterfly. In the guise of the Butterfly, she could act swiftly and directly against Thrune agents and raise the morale of the oppressed; as Vyvienne, she could sneak into a party hosted by local nobility and learn Thrune's secrets. She could also show her true heritage as the Butterfly, serving as a symbol to all the people of Cheliax of the power, intelligence, and beauty of tieflings.

With Vyvienne's tireless aid, the Silver Ravens succeeded in liberating Kintargo and creating the new state of Ravounel. Perhaps the Sapphire Butterfly's work could have ended there, and Vyvienne could have returned to the stage. But the stages of Kintargo now seemed too small to her. Yes, Ravounel was free, but Westcrown was not. Thrune still controlled most of Cheliax; beyond its borders, oppressed peoples struggled for freedom that was just barely out of reach.

When the Vidric rebels sailed into Kintargo's harbor, the Sapphire Butterfly was among the first to embrace them. She actively encouraged the alliance between these freedom fighters and the Silver Ravens that would lead to the birth of the Firebrands. When a rebellion sparked in Galt that claimed to be tied to the Firebrands, the Sapphire Butterfly immediately advocated assistance and was soon on the front lines. She now travels throughout the Inner Sea Region, showing up to aid the oppressed as they rise up, to foment rebellion forward, to end slavery, and to help local Firebrands in all such causes.

Vyvienne remains close to her sister, **Emylne** (NG female tiefling^APG human seamstress), who brims with courageous loyalty and offers her support whenever possible. But Emylne is happy to make costumes for Kintargo's operas and to contemplate bringing children into an improving world. Vyvienne has no such dreams for herself, no desire to settle down or to complicate the freedom that allows her to be where she is needed, whenever she is needed. In truth, she has never allowed herself to fall in love. She has never been willing to be that vulnerable—not even when romantic entanglements were in vogue among her acting friends, in those long-ago days before the Night of Ashes.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE When Vyvienne joined the Silver Ravens and their rebellion, she became familiar with the Bellflower Network, thanks to operative Laria Longroad (CG female
