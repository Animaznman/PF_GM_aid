# Xerbystes II, Hebizid Vraj, and Deena al-Parishat

I did not hear what the genie-binder said to the shahiyan, and certainly could not describe the look of wrath that fell over her face. You would not believe the insults the woman could craft, nor the speed at which she could conjure them! The merchant looked to her husband for help, but the satrap only laughed at the display. It seems the throne of Kelesh sent the one woman as disagreeable as him for a bride, may Sarenrae save us all. –overheard at a sandship caravan at the

Xerbystes II, Hebizid Vraj, and Deena al-Parishat

A Note Attached to a Heavy Purse *Steadfast One,*

Please convey this gift to our bellicose friends in Canal Row. They will be concerned to learn of the Satrapian Guard exercises near Delenah, no doubt. A show of force would prove that Taldor's recent internal troubles have not weakened the empire's resolve. Once knowledge of the provocations in Golsifar becomes widespread, the Senate will have no choice but to take military action. Qadira will react in kind. By My Own Hand, X

XERBYSTES II

SATRAP OF QADIRA N MALE HUMAN ARISTOCRAT The province of Qadira is the frontier of perhaps the largest empire in the world, but early in his training to become satrap, a young Xerystes realized that the imperial bureaucrats of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh had forgotten what a frontier is. Qadira is forever surrounded by threats, forever far from imperial aid, and forever waiting for Taldor to resume its millennia-long habit of conquering its neighbors. Despite the comfort of his upbringing in the Qahir Palace of Katheer, Xerystes never lost sight of the fact that life on the frontier meant danger.

Today, the tall, bronze-skinned satrap believes that he could end that danger permanently, and earn a place for himself in history, by executing a decisive invasion of Taldor. Unfortunately for Xerbystes's plans of conquest, the Padishah Emperor has expressly forbidden military intervention in Taldor, instead directing Vizier Hebizid Vraj to strengthen ties with Grand Princess Eutropia's new regime. Though he does have a grudging respect for Eutropia's resourcefulness in claiming the throne, Xerbystes deeply resents the meddling from the distant capital.

This interference is not the only example in Xerbystes's life on the emperor's long leash. Under threat of removal from his position, the long-time bachelor has taken a distant member of the imperial family, Deena al-Parishat, for a wife. Deena is a shahiyan, or a member of the royal family too far removed from the throne to have a more specific title. Though initially suspicious of Deena, the satrap has become intrigued by his passionate spouse, and many wonder if the new shahiyan will soon sway her husband into banning the practice of keeping mortal slaves.

While publicly Xerbystes can do little more than review the Satrapian Guard and complain about Taldan aggression, he continues to fund covert operations to heighten tensions along Qadira's northern border, hoping to goad Taldor into military action that might spiral into all-out war. Not daring to send the Peerless, his personal entourage of heroes who are all closely watched by his vizier, Xerbystes relies on dupes within Taldor or independent operators to accomplish his goals.

With much of the country's military force tied up in preparation for eventual war, Xerystes prefers to contract with mercenaries or adventurers to address domestic troubles. Recent reports of qlippoth in the Maharev Jungle, sinister cultists off the Emerald Coast, and a fiendish infestation in the Meraz Desert have caused him to put out a call for adventurers willing to hazard danger in exchange for Keleshite gold.

A Diplomatic Communiqué To Her Imperial Majesty, Grand Princess Eutropia of Taldor, I would like to extend a personal apology on behalf of Emperor Kalish XXII for the recent unpleasantness involving Trestarin Vain of Daggermark. The Qadiran coins found on his person are a transparent attempt by outsiders to reignite conflict that would weaken both of our empires. Still, we will redouble the efforts to remind citizens of our western-most satrapy that peace is mutually beneficial and mutually profitable. Speaking of which, I have enclosed draft proposals for a number of trade agreements. I trust you to guide them through the labyrinth of your Senate. Exchange of lumber and spice will do more to bind the wounds of our nations than any peace treaties or imperial edicts. Light of Dawn to You, Hebizid Vraj

HEBIZID VRAJ VIZIER OF QADIRA NG MALE HUMAN INVESTIGATOR Many Kelesh diplomats would find assignment to Katheer to be a hardship post, but Hebizid Vraj relishes his position as vizier of the empire's most isolated satrapy. Far from the imperial court, the canny Vraj enjoys almost complete autonomy. While dealing with the constant resentment of Satrap Xerbystes II is unpleasant in the extreme, the energetic vizier focuses his efforts on making the best of his situation. To Vraj, Qadira is the bridge between the Inner Sea region and the Kelesh Empire, and the best of both regions should be brought together in Katheer.

Much to the chagrin of Qadira's satrap, the Padishah Empire long ago traded military domination for economic, and much of Vraj's time is concerned with tending to the empire's extensive web of trade agreements. Whether dealing with Hashim ibn Sayyid as the chosen agent of Katapesh's Pactmasters or coaxing Taldan merchants to set aside ancient prejudices, the vizier is a shrewd bargainer. Employing a vast network of intelligence agents, Vraj ensures that he knows his partners' positions as well as his own and leverages that information to accomplish what he sees as best for the empire.

Though international relations are Vraj's primary focus, the vizier pursues opportunities to improve life for the average Qadiran. Vraj is a patron of the arts and sciences in Katheer and, in his small amount of free time, he enjoys attending lectures at the Planar Institute and the Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery. Though his efforts are currently secret, the vizier is zealously attempting to entice the great Rahadoumi healer, Kassi Aziril, to tone down her outspoken atheism enough to join the teaching staff at the Venicaan College, promising not only a substantial salary but also protection from any complications that immigration to Qadira might bring.

Many other projects within the country attract portions of Vraj's attention: he frequently seeks experienced explorers to accompany military patrols to ruins in the Meraz Desert and Zho Mountains; he gathers reports of missing persons and property for investigation by the military or independent contractors; and he recruits skilled engineers and craftspeople to complete complex public works.

Vraj's work in Qadira is the center of his life, and he is worried that any upcoming struggle over imperial succession will see him

I think I sympathize with Hebizid Vraj more than is strictly healthy, and I am fortunate to have many well-spoken advisors to help me keep an acceptable level of displeasure. —Grand Princess Eutropia

# THE PEERLESS Hand-selected by Xerbystes II, this group of heroes undertakes missions into dangerous and wild places. While many of their deeds are known only to the satrap, the following heroes and their accomplishments are popular topics of gossip.

Kendesh al-Maren (LN male sylphB2 elf infiltrator) Called "The Shadow of al-Bashir," this warrior has retrieved many relics from that cursed city, using his congenital deafness as a defense against the harpies that rule there.

Misayyah (NG nonbinary human tracker) While many speculate on the age, ancestry, and gender of this scarf-shrouded tracker, no one questions their kindness; they are well-known for returning children lost in sandstorms to their families.

Paldira, the Mirage (LN male half-orc illusionist) This illusionist singlehandedly ended the gnoll siege of a town in Pashman by conjuring visions that sent the creatures screaming into the desert.

Tinari al-Yathin (N female half-elf corsair) From her ship, the *Perilous*, this young Peerless hunts the shores of the Minatory Isles, clearing the waters of cultists, monsters, and pirates.

recalled to the Kelesh capital. Not only would his departure mean many projects left unfinished, it would also likely mean war between Taldor and Qadira, as imperial oversight is the only thing standing in the way of Xerystes's plans for invasion.

A Perfumed Letter, Sent to the Imperial Capital _Dearest Cousin,_ _I must tell you, Layilah, that while Katheer is a bit of a backwater, it is not without its pleasures. The Qahir Palace would seem cramped by your standards, but it is well furnished, and the mosaic work would not be out of place at home. The satrap keeps one of the finest stables in the province, and he is an accomplished rider himself. As you know, our marriage was no love match, but I am pleased to share that interest with him._

You would not believe the horses, Laylah! Gray as mist and swift-footed as the wind, or shimmering gold and able to keep a rider warm through the coldest night on the sands. Some say the horses were a gift from genies long ago, and I believe it. The genie-touched horses here are my chief joy, but they also remind me of my chief sorrow. I know only vague rumors of the practice have reached the capital, but I cannot walk through the Grand Souk without seeing an efreeti bound in iron chains or some conjurer with his "pet" marid. Many of the nobles and merchants here keep human or halfling slaves, and slave markets operate openly in the city! It makes my blood boil. I have freed all of the palace slaves and established salaries for them, but there is much more to do. In fact, I must cut this letter short to meet with an advisor and one of the palace wizards. All of my best to you and your mother. Write me soon, Deena

DEENA AL-GHARLA ANTIM ZHAR AL-PARISHAT SHAHIYAN OF QADIRA N FEMALE HUMAN ARISTOCRAT Most people's first impression of Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat is the snap of a cloak and the thunder of hooves as she rushes through the pre-dawn streets of Katheer on the way to her morning ride through the city's outskirts. Those lucky enough to earn an audience with her speak of her frank nature and calm self-assurance. An athletic woman with warm bronze skin and copper highlights in her dark hair, al-Parishat's appearance marks her origins in central Kelesh, and, indeed, she is a recent immigrant to Qadira, having traveled from the capital of the Padishah Empire for an arranged marriage with Satrap Xerystes II. The people of Qadira have generally welcomed the newcomer, hoping that the long-awaited end to Xerystes's bachelorhood will settle questions of succession in the satrapy.

Despite the warm reception offered her, Shahiyan Deena is a polarizing figure. Her outspoken abolitionist stances have impressed the country's slaves and Sarenites as much as they have discomfited Qadiran traditionalists. At least for the moment, Xerbystes seems unconcerned by her habit of upbraiding genie binders in the streets, a fact that has endeared her new husband to her. The two also share a mutual fondness for her distant cousin **Layilah** (NG female human priestess of Sarenrae), who both believe would be an excellent candidate for heir to the Kelesh imperial throne. While she is still far from trusting her husband with her heart, or the extent of her plans about reforming Qadira, the shahiyan has found Xerbystes to be more than the warmonger she had resigned herself to marrying.

Al-Parishat has discussed some of her plans with Vizier Hebizid Vraj, who shares many of her imperial Keleshite sensibilities. On his advice, the shahiyan is cultivating allies at the Planar Institute in Katheer and recruiting agents to investigate rumors of geniekin communities in the Zho Mountains. What the vizier does not know is that she is actively seeking to make contact with the Bellflower Network, and hopes to fund clandestine efforts to undermine the Qadiran slave trade, particularly in Sedeq.

GENIE-TOUCHED COMPANIONS (RARE) Xerystes II has had his palace spellcasters work to develop ways to replicate the great powers of the genie-touched horses of Qadira. These spellcasters have a rudimentary method in place that can grant such power to any animal companion, infusing them with elemental power and granting them otherworldly insight. Xerystes will sometimes gift these companions as a favor to others or have his spellcasters infuse the companions of trusted allies.

If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have a savage or nimble animal companion, you can instead choose to for it to become a genie-touched companion. When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion. The genies and their elemental traits are as follows: djinni (air), efreeti (fire), marid (water), or shaitan (earth). A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Acrobatics to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie's elemental trait. Genie-touched companions can choose from the following options when they become specialized animal companions.

Deep Diver Your companion gains a swim Speed of 30 feet or a +10-foot status bonus to its existing swim Speed and can breathe underwater if it couldn't already. Its Constitution modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank for Athletics increases to master and for barding increases to expert. This specialization can only be selected by marid-touched companions.

Steadfast Strider Your companion ignores natural difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from sediment or stone and can move across quicksand, mud, and similar surfaces as if they were solid. It gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws and DCs to prevent being Shoved or Tripped. Its Strength modifier increases by 1 and its proficiency for barding increases to expert. This specialization can only be selected by shaitan-touched companions.

Wildfire Scorcher Your companion gains resistance to fire equal to your level. Any creature that attempts to Grapple or Grab your companion, hits your companion with a melee unarmed attack, or hits your companion with a melee weapon Strike while adjacent to your companion takes 2d6 fire damage. Its Dexterity modifier increases by 1 and its proficiency rank increases to legendary for Reflex saves and to expert for unarmored defense. This specialization can only be selected by efreeti-touched companions.

Wind Chaser Your companion gains a +20-foot status bonus to its Speed or fly Speed (your choice if it has both). Its proficiency in Acrobatics increases to master and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank increases to legendary for Reflex saves and to expert for unarmored defense. This specialization can only be selected by djinni-touched companions.
