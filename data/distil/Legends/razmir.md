RAZMIR

# RULER OF RAZMIRAN LE MALE HUMAN WIZARD Leader of the nation he forged, Razmir is a ruler bold enough to call himself a living god. Claiming to have taken the test of the Starstone back in 4660 AR, this so-called deity set about carving out a swath of the River Kingdoms to call his own, destroying anyone who dared to stand in his way. In the years since, Razmir has attracted an influential cult of followers. Lured to him with the promise of prosperity and peace, converts more often than not find themselves struggling to survive in a nation that seems built to funnel wealth and privilege to the priests. They are told that only through more devotion to Razmir might they be able find a way into a paradise in this life.

Razmir shrouds his past in rumor and myth, especially when it comes to his life before his supposed attempt at the test of the Starstone. In fact, scholars who have attempted to collect a complete tale of the Living God's mortal days find the history filled with conflicting events and differing origins. Some stories, for example, claim that he grew up in Taldor, penniless on the streets of Oppara, begging for food and sleeping under a sewer grate; others purport that he was raised in Varisia on a small rural farm, destined to live a simple life until he uncovered the secret library of the Runelords, learning to wield their mighty power all on his own. Despite their differences, all of these stories bear a few basic similarities. In each, Razmir came from humble beginnings, neither wealthy nor powerful, but through his own cunning and daring, he rose to become a deity.

What is known conclusively is that he arrived in the River Kingdoms in 4661 AR and declared himself to the people of Xer, a town on the border with Kyonin. As Razmir gathered followers, the local magistrate attempted to arrest him inside the halls of his very first temple. Razmir offered the magistrate a place in the clergy if he would submit, but the magistrate refused. In a flash of power, the poor magistrate was transformed into a fox, left to wander the world, forced to finally believe his own senses. The town was under Razmir's control in less than a week, but this angered the nearby Duke Melcat of Aerduin, who considered Xer to be part of his domain. Razmir offered prosperity and peace to Duke Melcat if only he would convert to the faith. Three times Duke Melcat refused, and on the final refusal, Razmir summoned a cloud of smoke and flame that erased Aerduin from the face of Avistan. In this moment, Razmiran was born.

From there, the Living God spread his faith north, annexing over a dozen small fiefdoms and minor kingdoms. His army was made up entirely from converts—they were far from professional warriors, but with the personal backing of Razmir, they were rarely challenged. It was only upon reaching Ustalav that this expansion slowed. Razmir's attempts to annex further River Kingdoms have proven fruitless. That has not stopped him from trying, although he now employs subtler methods. The faithful of Razmir travel far and wide to spread the gospel. When arriving in a community, they immediately take up with the poor and indigent, offering them food, aid, and succor, all the while telling these desperate souls about the glory that is Razmir. With the new believers behind them, they then petition to open up a shrine and pressure local businesses to offer up donations to the church to protect and improve the neighborhood. If left unchecked, they soon infiltrate the local militia and then the government, using masks to hide the true identities of the faithful.

# FRIENDS AND FOES OF THE FAITH As the head of his own religion, Razmir has few friends. His foes weigh far more heavily on the Living God's mind.

Artokus Kirran, the Thuvian alchemist, has long been brewing a precious sun orchid elixir that can return any imbiber to youth. After Razmir's winning bid on the elixir was fraudulently rejected—at least, in his own mind—rumors hold that Razmir has sent a number of agents of Thuvia to either steal the recipe for the elixir or perhaps even kidnap the alchemist.

Razmir technically remains at war with the elven nation of Kyonin, though the ruler seems to have little interest in actually pursuing any battles with his neighbors. Yet Queen Telandia Edasseril's policy of allowing fleeing citizens of Razmiran into Kyonin, so long as they aren't Razmir's priests, has recently resulted in turmoil along the two nations' shared borders. In addition to refugees being attacked by cultists intent upon showing defectors the error of their ways, Queen Telandia suspects that Razmir may have sent infiltrators to weaken Kyonin for some unknown purpose—or simply out of spite.

No one is a bigger threat to Razmir's rule than the Whispering Tyrant. Freed from his prison under Gallowspire, Tar-Baphon is now rebuilding his fortress on the Isle of Terror, making his return an existential threat to all those who border Lake Encarthan. Not long after the Tyrant's return, Razmir sent a herald to the Isle with an offer of nonaggression. The herald returned, now a wraith wearing the mask of Razmir's faith, accepting the offer with one condition: Razmiran would tithe its dead to the Tyrant, at least 1,000 bodies per month, to maintain the peace. No one knows if the Living God accepted these terms, but as of yet there has been no fighting between the two. The Pale Mask, as the herald has come to be known, still resides in Thronestep and can be found wandering the city at night. Yet Blood Mistress Jakalyn of the Red Mantis Assassins recently announced that someone had paid for a contract to be placed on Tar-Baphon, and discovered that the messenger hailed from Razmiran. It's uncertain whether the missive was from Razmir himself, an acolyte who overstepped, or an enemy hoping to gain Razmir the wrong sort of attention, and just as uncertain is what might result from a clash between any of these three powers.

# THE UNMASKED SERVANT Countless servants and sycophants are found among the ranks of Razmir's priesthood, and many of these are important to the operation of his kingdom and religion. Most of Razmir's

faithful prefer to maintain their anonymity behind the masks that they wear, but not **Vilnaria Tyn**, the Red Coin (LE female human cultist). Her mask is cracked down one side, missing from the nose down, revealing

part of her face. Vilnaria serves as Razmir's personal enforcer, rooting out the unfaithful and punishing any who dare to displease the god. Anyone unfortunate enough to receive her red

coin has 1 day to make amends for their transgressions or face her wrath. On more than one occasion, Vilnaria has left the remains of those who failed to appease her out in public for all to see, as a warning to those who would dare to defy Razmir.
