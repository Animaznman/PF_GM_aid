# ARTOKUS KIRRAN

small amount of favor with Sorshen, who has since visited Ardax a handful of times. Though wary of her incredible power, Ardax is glad to have sown the seed of alliance with someone feared by those who may wish him harm.

# THE BATTLE OF NINE BROKEN SKULLS When the undead came to Urgir, looking to reaffirm the ancient oaths the orcs' ancestors pledged to Tar-Baphon, Ardax wasted no words on them: he had the envoys cut down as soon as they had finished their speeches. He then hung their heads on the walls of Urgir and sent their mounts back over the border dragging the messengers' corpses behind them, Tar-Baphon's proposals stuffed into their necks.

Tar-Baphon responded by sending a detachment of troops to crush the older orc and his forces, expecting the oft-fractured orc holds to fall easily. Ardax instead rallied a desperate coalition of orcs into one army, using Urgir as their fortress. When the long battle ended with the total rout of the Whispering Tyrant's forces before the united strength of the holds, Ardax strode into the field and claimed ten skulls from the fallen undead. Nine times, Ardax held a skull in the air before the gathered might of the orcs. He named each after an enemy overcome by orcs' strength and crushed them in his hands. The tenth he named Tar-Baphon and left whole, adorned with cow horns as a mockery of the Tyrant. He keeps the tenth skull nearby, bearing it as a reminder of the orcs' shared enemy.

# BELKZEN, A FRAGILE NATION The Battle of Nine Broken Skulls cemented Ardax as the effective leader of the orc holds, and the remaining orc lords declared him overlord in the wake of their victory. Ardax accepted and has busied himself since with matters of state, trying to keep his fragile alliance from falling apart while working toward a self-sufficient Belkzen. The war machines left intact after the battle with the undead were repurposed into plows, and the hold of Regnat

the Green (CN male orc druid) of the Storm-Screamers was given the oversight of potential crops in the churned and drying mud left by the retreating waters on the Flood Road. In recognition of the Burning Sun's contribution in battle, Ardax gave the Sarenite orc hold sole rights to a stretch of hunting grounds bordering the Gravelands. Immediately following this edict, the Twisted Nail threatened to retaliate against Ardax, claiming the Burning Sun had no right to that land. Ardax responded by giving the Twisted Nail hold the honor of negotiating peace with Sheblis and Tyrkalis, the two red dragons living in the Tusk Mountains.

Outside of Belkzen, Ardax has sent emissaries south to the nation of Oprak in hopes of allying with General Azasersi. Though it seems a natural alliance, negotiations with the hobgoblin nation have been tense and slow to resolve. The orc leader of the newly unified Belkzen remains hopeful that both nations can work together and establish their legitimacy against fear and disgust from the human-dominated nations. For if Belkzen is to survive another attack from the undead or an opportunistic assault by another nation, it must make new alliances.

# DESPERATE TIMES Ardax has not been shy in seeking allies against the looming threat of Tar-Baphon's reprisals. Caravans claiming to have been saved from roving undead by orc patrols have arrived in cities near Lake Encarthan, with letters bearing the seal of Overlord Ardax the White-Hair. The letters have already reached the knight Kalabrynne Iomedar on the fringes of the Gravelands, and others offer rewards to anyone willing to carry diplomatic messages from Urgir to other nations of the Inner Sea region.

# A PAIR OF MISSIVES Boss, we're running short of saltpeter and phosphorus. This class likes explosive demonstrations more than usual. Also, when is the last time you took a break?

Tukalo– Better they get the explosions out of their system now. I'll order more saltpeter and phosphorus. Bring enough salve to reattach any missing fingers. I'll have a break tomorrow. Be prepared to go to Lamasara.

Artokus Kirran

CREATOR OF THE SUN ORCHID ELIXIR N MALE HUMAN ALCHEMIST It was only after Artokus paid for the fried dough from the street vendor that his familiar, Tukalo, reminded him of the proprieties. Perched on Artokus's shoulder, the meerkat nudged him. "You're supposed to ask her name. It's polite."

"Why, when I have no intention of telling her mine?" Artokus pushed his way through the crowds that thronged the streets of Lamasara. With his vigorous stride and vibrant brown skin, not one of them would guess the young man in the desert robes was over three thousand years old.

"You could have made up a name," Tukalo said, his voice taking on the professorial tone that he used for lecturing Artokus's students. The meerkat cocked his head. "But you don't ask because you don't want to know. If you learn their names, they become real to you, don't they?"

Artokus frowned. "Why did I make you again?" "Because I know the best bugs to use for elixirs. Beetles are the tastiest." Tukalo stood high on his hind feet to peer out at the crowd. People jostled one another as they moved back and forth through the streets—not just Thuvians, but hundreds of foreign adventurers. "Are they all here for Queen Zamere's convoy?"

"Most of them," Artokus admitted. "The convoys need guards and pay well." The pair paused to enjoy a street dance performance, right up until Artokus realized that the old actor surrounded by mincing dancers in floral costumes was supposed to be him. Tukalo stumbled as the alchemist turned in a swirl of cloth and squeaked in protest. "It was just getting good!"

Artokus' only response was a growl, so his familiar decided not to push his luck. "Who are we coming to meet?" Tukalo asked. "Who said we were meeting anyone?"

The meerkat sighed. "Fried dough and a bit of theater is not enough to tear the famed hermit away from his chambers. You hole yourself up, you don't even talk to your students–"

"You do a fine job teaching them." "And if I lecture them, you don't have to meet them." Tukalo sulked, drooping on Artokus's head like a dead weight. "Do you know that many of them think you're actually dead? What am I going to do with you, boss?"

A spider crossed their path as the meerkat spoke. Then two. Then ten. Swarming spiders poured through the festival crowd, the unaware mortals chatting and laughing, heedless of the carpet of arachnids at their feet.

"How can they not see this?" Tukalo breathed heavily, watching the spiders pass. Artokus said nothing.

Slowly, the spiders converged around the alchemist, herding his heels like a pack of dogs. Artokus wordlessly followed, walking slowly and with respect, though seemingly heedless of where he stepped. The spiders led them through the city and into the Serene Spiral, Lamasara's soaring temple of Pharasma. A young acolyte with umber skin and coiled black hair was waiting for them, blue robes gently swaying alongside the water in the flat pool that graced the temple's foyer. "You are expected."

Artokus offered his sack of fried dough. With the air of a ritual, the acolyte produced a tea set, her garment slowly shifting from Pharasmin robes to gray spider silk, a webbed mask, and silver wings hung with spiders. "You're a morrigna." The meerkat hopped in front of Artokus as if his tiny body could defend the alchemist, scanning the stranger warily.

could defend the alchemist, scanning the stranger warily. "I am Tosof. I investigate those who thwart death or interfere with the flow of

souls." The morrigna nodded. "Long ago, an exemption was made for Artokus Kirran in the church's name. I have been following the case ever since."

"The church, yes." Artokus stretched and gestured around him at the ornate and gilded stonework. "What a fine temple to Pharasma that was built, all with proceeds from the sun orchid. Come now, we have plenty of time for business, and Tukalo has just today lectured me to mind my proprieties. Shall we not share tea?" "Very well." Tosof poured drinks for all assembled at the table, taking a single sip before leaving both cup and fried dough to sit untouched on her plate.

Tukalo sniffed at the morrigna, watching the spiders spin webs between her silver wings and robes. "So, you've called us here to see if my boss has strayed out of line?" The meerkat's tail twitched.

"Something like that. We like to check in once every century or so. At one point, we knew when all this would end."

Artokus sighed. "Then prophecy broke, and so did my known terms of service." "An oversimplification, but yes," the morrigna said. "You could even live forever." "No, I can't." Artokus stilled, his shoulders stiffening. He continued, in a strangled voice, "Do you know the other reason I came to Lamasara this year? It was to observe that university of arcane engineering that Lord Yamthar is building. The man hopes to wean Thuvia from the sun orchid elixir, and I pray that he manages it. Everything in all of Thuvia—the libraries, the schools, the civic halls—it all stems from the sun orchid. I dreamed of giving Thuvia its start. I was only going to do this until my nation stood on its own feet." Artokus gestures out the window. "Look! What industry does my Thuvia have, save what I've created? If I pull back... If I stop, it all falls to ruin."

"All things fa—" Tosof broke off, staring at the chewing meerkat on the table. "Are you eating my spiders?"

Tukalo popped the rest of the spider's leg in his mouth, swallowing hard before speaking. "No, of course not. That would be rude."

The psychopomp pulled her robes hastily away. "I think we're done here."

# THE ARCHITECT OF IMMORTALITY Artokus Kirran is the most famous hermit of the Inner Sea region. Born in the city-state of Merab in Thuvia, Artokus Kirran discovered the secret to eternal life in 1140 AR: an alchemical elixir made from the nectar of the sun orchid. He brought his creation to the leaders of his city, and they forged a pact. Artokus alone, of all citizens of Thuvia, would partake of the elixir, out of respect for the goddess Pharasma. The alchemist would produce six more vials every year, which would be auctioned off to foreigners. The gold from these sales would be used to enrich and defend the nation.

Of course, with such a valuable cargo, things often go awry with anything involving the sun orchid elixir. Those who can't afford to purchase the elixir often seek to steal it—sometimes directly from the source. Of late, Razmir the Living God failed to purchase the elixir yet again, due to disputes over ownership of some of his collateral that devalued his bid. Despite being so far unable to obtain the elixir that he seeks, Razmir has managed to send multiple threatening letters directly to Artokus Kirran himself. Merely making the elixir is also a dangerous and difficult task, and Artokus's servants pay handsomely for living sun orchids, Thuvian oasis bee honey, and other ingredients from harsh deserts plagued by fiends, water lords, and bandits alike. Sun orchid finds have become much rarer over the decades, a fact that worries many.

Artokus keeps abreast of current events, always hoping to aid Thuvia's economic independence. Each city-state sends him regular reports not just on auction prices but on the projects his sun orchid elixir finances. Although concerned about

TUKALO'S LECTURES: INSECTS IN ALCHEMY The insect world is largely ignored by most people, unless they're looking for ways to exterminate vermin and swarms. But bugs aren't just delicious, they're an alchemist's best friend. **Venoms:** Many of our best poisons, from giant centipede to purple worm venom, come from vermin. Poison and medicine are flip sides to one another. A bit of venom used judiciously in a potion can help a patient overcome their worst symptoms or sometimes slow the spread of a disease.

**Mutagens:** Can you imagine Leaper's Elixir without essence of grasshopper? How about Juggernaut Mutagen without ant extract?

**Cleansing and Processing:** Bees make honey, maggots clean out rotten flesh, spiders make the silken webs we use for filters.

**Dyes, Antiseptics, Reagents:** Once you start looking, you will discover hundreds of specialized uses, which I will discuss in detail over the next four weeks.

NOTABLE SUN ORCHID ELIXIR BUYERS No Thuvian may buy sun orchid elixir. Queen Abrogail Thrune II–75,000 gp: The queen purchased her first vial after recent turmoil in Cheliax. Countess Carmilla Caliphvaso (LE female human aristocrat)–71,000 gp: The Ustalav countess insists that the next time she purchases the elixir, it must be hand delivered by "dear Artokus Kirran." Queen Galfrey of Mendev (LG female herald of Iomedae)–64,000 gp: The Mendevian people purchased the elixir for their queen twice before she abdicated to become a herald of Iomedae. King Huang of Lingshen (LN male human fighter)–80,000 gp: The king sent two trusted generals with chests filled with magic weapons to purchase a vial.

Aspenthar's growing militarism, Artokus refuses to take sides between the city-states. The alchemist has also recently caused a stir by accepting two hobgoblin alchemy students at General Azasersi's request, though Artokus is keeping any motives for his decision close to his chest.

Centuries of life and relative seclusion have taken their toll on Artokus' personal life and social skills. He has not appeared as himself to anyone within living memory. He has close in-person relationships with his blind servants, but keeps even his students at a distance, teaching his alchemical lessons via Tukalo, his meerkat familiar. A dedicated correspondent, he does write diligently to his former students—including Kassi Aziril, a rising star—as well as to scholars, dignitaries, and economists around Golarion. One of his few non-business correspondences has been with Chancellor Irahai, a Mendevian dignitary of Thuvian heritage, with whom he discusses his hopes for his nation and shares his love of Thuvian literature and history.

# ARTOKUS'S DISCOVERIES Artokus Kirran's legacy includes far more than just the sun orchid elixir. As one of the longest-lived alchemists in Golarion, he's developed a number of other significant alchemical discoveries known across the Inner Sea region. The following are some of his more notable discoveries. Artokus is cautious about sharing his alchemical techniques and typically only does so with his most trusted students.

ARTOKUS'S FIRE ◇ FEAT 6 RARE ADDITIVE 2 ALCHEMIST Frequency once per round Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemist's fire, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level. Artokus developed a mixture of volatile materials that burns hotter and longer than typical alchemist's fire. You include this additive mixture when crafting your alchemist's fire. The alchemist's fire deals 1d4 persistent fire damage in addition to what the alchemist fire would normally cause (for instance, a moderate alchemist's fire deals 1d4+2 persistent fire damage). A creature taking persistent fire damage from the alchemist's fire requires two successful flat checks to end the persistent damage, or one check if the creature had an assisted recovery that reduces the flat check to DC 10. The enhanced alchemist's fire burns even underwater, and any attempts to end the persistent damage by using water have no effect.

SUN ORCHID POULTICE ITEM 18 RARE ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE Price 5,000 gp Usage held in 1 hands; Bulk L Activate [figure: black diamond with white chevron] Interact The process of creating the sun orchid elixir leaves behind a large amount of thick paste with its own healing properties. Artokus commonly sells this paste to Thuvian natives who can't purchase the elixir proper and uses the income to support his alchemy students. When you apply the sun orchid poultice, it reduces your clumsy, drained, and enfeebled condition values by 2. In addition, the poultice provides a youthful burst of energy, granting you a +3 item bonus to saves and 20 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.

WISH ALCHEMY FEAT 20 RARE ALCHEMIST You have learned Artokus Kirran's most hidden secrets, granting you the ability to create alchemy infused with the power of wishes. Once per day when you use advanced alchemy during your daily preparations, you can spend a batch of infused reagents to create a wish vial containing a single common arcane spell of your choice of 8th level or lower. The spell must have a casting time of no more than 3 actions, no Cost, and must be able to target you. Only you can Activate the wish vial, which takes the same number of Interact actions as the spell's casting time and grants you the effects of the spell.
