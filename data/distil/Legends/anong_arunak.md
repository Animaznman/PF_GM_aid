# ANONG ARUNAK

Though our acquaintance with the high king of Dongun is confined to letters, it remains exceptionally memorable. The king holds great wisdom beyond her centuries, and she always finds an answer for what troubles her people. It seems that anyone speaking with her will find exactly what they needed in her eyes: compassion, friendship, guidance, ruthlessness. —High King Borogrim the Hale

# ANONG ARUNAK

# HIGH KING OF DONGUN HOLD LG FEMALE DWARF ARISTOCRAT The dwarven fortress city of Dongun Hold, a rare and fiercely guarded outpost of civilization and safety in the magic-dead Mana Wastes, has been ruled for centuries by the dwarven High King Anong Arunak. It was High King Arunak who met personally with the eccentric exile **Ancil Alkenstar** (LN male human engineer), who went on to found the nation that shares his name, and it was Arunak who both directed the development of firearms in Dongun Hold and negotiated the lucrative trade agreements that permit Alkenstar's Gunworks to manufacture and sell the dwarven inventions. Few people have been more instrumental in shaping the recent history and current position of the Mana Wastes than the High King of Dongun Hold, and yet very little is known about her.

Anong Arunak began her life far underground in a cavern in the Darklands, where the dwarves of Dongun Hold had retreated to escape the unending war between the wizards Nex and Geb. Born to the royal house and trained since birth to rule her people, she complemented that education with her own studies to become one of the most far-sighted leaders of her generation. When Ancil Alkenstar discovered the dwarves and the gunpowder weapons that they had perfected, Anong accepted an audience with the refugee, listening to his news of an end to the war between the wizards and a refuge for exiles located in the Mana Wastes.

When Ancil Alkenstar discovered the dwarves and the gunpower weapons that they had perfected, Anong accepted an audience with the refugee, listening to his news of an end to the war between the wizards and a refuge for exiles located in the Mana Wastes. Recognizing the unique opportunity presented by Alkenstar and his encampment, High King Arunak led her people back to the surface to retake their ancestral Sky Citadel, invested heavily in the nascent technology of firearms to protect her people from the lethal beasts of the Mana Wastes, and then further capitalized on that investment by licensing the technology to Alkenstar's Gunworks. However, she also understood the threat that such weapons could pose in unworthy hands and has firmly restricted the number that become available for outside trade, though production limits have been increased in recent years. Similarly, High King Arunak pushed aside the hold's entrenched xenophobia to aid and protect Alkenstar's early settlers, ensuring that the nation would become a strong ally for Dongun Hold. High King Arunak was even willing to open negotiations with the magic-infused nation of Nex, whose arcane wars with Geb devastated Dongun Hold in an earlier age. Although the Nex-Geb war caused immense suffering in Dongun

Although the Nex-Geb war caused immense suffering in Dongun Hold as the fortress city was conquered and re-conquered by each side, High King Arunak overruled her isolationist advisors and chose to open trade lines with a nation that her people had mistrusted for centuries.

# TROUBLE IN PARADISE The high king's decisions have led Dongun Hold to unprecedented prosperity, but her rulings haven't gone unchallenged. Centuries of seclusion have left many Dongun dwarves with a profound mistrust of others, and though more than a century of alliance with Alkenstar has softened this view, extremists remain common. Each of Anong Arunak's policies has invited its own set of enemies. The Keepers of the Skyflame, a cohort of traditionalist dwarves originally founded to maintain Dongun Hold's cultural links to its fellow Sky Citadels, opposed the development of firearms as an unnecessary and dangerous innovation. The Skyflame also opposed letting any of that technology slip into human

hands and they were infuriated by the idea of opening trade links with Nex and Alkenstar. The Goldhand Lodge, another frequent opponent of the king's, is a mercantile association that wants to raise the Gunworks' production quota so that they can increase their profits. Goldhand agents regularly try to evade the king's restrictions; several of them have been arrested for smuggling firearms and other contraband out of Dongun Hold. High King Arunak has recently received envoys from Hashim ibn Sayyid, the enigmatic Pactbroker of Katapesh, who wishes to open trade negotiations—the Goldhand Lodge is now pressuring the king to embrace the Pactbroker's offer immediately, and the suggestion has predictably infuriated the Keepers of the Skyflame. For now, the king is trying to chart a middle course.

Another budding problem is the upwelling of popular anxiety about the rumored return of the archwizard Nex. The mighty fleshforges of Ecanus have suddenly begun to churn uncontrolled horrors into the Mana Wastes, putting both Alkenstar and Dongun Hold in peril. The possibility of Nex's return, and the reignition of his country's long war with Geb, has inflamed deep-rooted fears in Dongun Hold. Pressure has fallen on High King Arunak to re-open the old underground quarters, reinforce the old protections, and ensure that they are ready to receive the city's population if the worst should come. After centuries of disuse, some of these tunnels have fallen into dangerous disrepair, and others have become infested with monsters. Clearing and restoring them is an expensive, hazardous endeavor.

Despite these challenges, High King Arunak remains broadly popular with her people, for she has greatly elevated Dongun Hold's power and prosperity. In Alkenstar, which would not exist as a nation without her help, the king is considered nearly a saint, and the companies of dwarven sharpshooters that Dongun Hold sends to help defend Alkenstar from marauding monsters are widely celebrated as heroes. Of course, the king's support is not entirely altruistic: these sharpshooters also protect Dongun Hold by ensuring that Alkenstar is the first line of defense and bears the cost of maintaining the most sorely tested fortifications. Nevertheless, the dwarven companies are an integral part of the alliance's shared defenses, and wanderers from the Mana Wastes who wish to earn citizenship in Dongun Hold often volunteer to serve with one of the companies as a starting point.

High King Arunak also maintains cordial relations with the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains, and she carries on a personal correspondence with the noted physician Kassi Aziril, whose achievements in non-magical healing are of considerable interest to the peoples of the Mana Wastes. Unknown to any of the other dwarves in Dongun Hold, the high king has also sent her most skilled and trusted envoy to seek a safe means to contact Overlord Ardax the White-Hair of Urgi—as Anong Arunak holds a letter with an apology so heretical to the dwarves that its delivery could dethrone her.

# POLITICAL LIABILITIES With each year, as the Skyflame dwarves lose more ground in the ideological war, their tactics become more extreme. Rumors link the Skyflame to several acts of sabotage, both of the firearms themselves and of trade negotiations, and whispers persist that they have even more violent actions planned: assassinations of diplomats, staged attacks they can blame on outsiders, and worse. The high king's agents are looking for proof that might link the Keepers of the Skyflame to these acts and thus potentially bring down the venerable organization, though they fear the uproar that might follow if they find it.
