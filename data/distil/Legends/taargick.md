BRIGHT LION DEDICATION FEAT 2 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of Walkena, trained in Stealth; Access Bright Lion background (Lost Omens World Guide 95) You become trained in your choice of Deception or Diplomacy and in Mzali Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to Lie or Impersonate to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

The tattoo allows you to cast the light cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts gentle repose on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.

# WALKENA'S SHADOW A Bright Lion's job is to blend in but be ready to damage Walkena's forces as much as possible at a moment's notice. While the Bright Lions are focused on overthrowing Walkena, he is not the enemy they face most often. **Themba Sufu** (LE male human rogue), the commander of Walkena's secret police, prowls the night searching for dissidents and insurrectionists–a description the Bright Lions fit in every aspect.

# TAARGICK'S LEGACY While Taargick is a mythical figure among the dwarves of Avistan and Garund, he is not as well-known among dwarves in other parts of Golarion. During the Quest for Sky, many dwarf clans went in their own directions in hopes of finding a more suitable route to reach Golarion's surface. Over the centuries, these clans lost contact with the main group that emerged in the Inner Sea region and eventually completed the quest independently. As a result, the dwarves of Arcadia, Tian Xia, and Casmaron each have their own stories and heroes, though they recognize Taargick's importance to the Inner Sea region.

# TAARGICK ## FIRST HIGH KING OF THE DWARVES, KING OF SKY **LG MALE DWARF ARISTOCRAT** Taargick is the most famous and storied of all dwarven rulers in the Inner Sea region, for he united the dwarf clans, founded the kingdom of Tar Taargadth, oversaw the completion of the Quest for Sky, and designed many of the first Sky Citadels.

The mighty dwarven leader known as Taargick was born in the Darklands in –5293 AR, the night the Starstone crashed into the surface world. His mother was Hilgart, a military commander and war oracle for the dwarven nation of Felgunn, one of a dozen or more subterranean kingdoms ruled by dwarves at the time. When Earthfall struck and many dwarves—taking this as a divine sign from Torag—called for a start to the Quest for Sky, most Felgunn citizens resisted the call, but Hilgart was not among them. Infant Taargick on her hip, she marched forth within days of Earthfall.

Thus, Taargick grew up always on the move, born to a life of constant struggle and divinely mandated hardship. As he came into maturity, Taargick wished to be a warrior, but his mother insisted he learn many different skills. She ensured he was trained in diplomacy, engineering, logistics, and religious rites and doctrines along with his martial training. Because he was clever, strong, and courageous, Taargick was often assigned to work groups when major issues arose in moving an entire people in an endless march, and he became well known and liked over his first two and a half centuries of life.

At the Battle of Basalt Grimm in –5153 AR, the united dwarven front was ambushed by a massed orc horde. Having been relentlessly driven from their homes and forced further and further toward the surface by the marching dwarven host, scores of orc clans found their hatred of the dwarves a bond strong enough to band together. The dwarven vanguard collapsed, and orc raiders struck deep behind the dwarven front lines. Thousands of dwarven civilians, children, and elders were slain, including Hilgart. The dwarves were overcome by shame and anger, and abandoned the Quest for Sky to pursue vengeance against all orcs. logo: stylized stone tower with gold trim, blue banners, and a small window

Without the unity of their shared mission, various dwarven factions began to press for greater control of the once-mobile nation's resources. For the first several years of this time, Taargick was as obsessed with vengeance as his compatriots. But as time passed, dwarven factions began to vocally suggest settling where they were, or even returning to their original homes. Taargick was horrified at the idea that all the suffering and work the dwarven people had undertaken might be put aside without accomplishing their divinely mandated goal and began passionately speaking in favor of a the Quest for Sky.

His deep connections to different dwarf factions served Taarqick in good stead, and many flocked to his call. They named themselves after him, calling the alliance Tar Taargadth. Over a few years, this alliance grew, in large part due to Taarqick's reputation as a hard-working, brave dwarf of skill and determination. When Taarqick began the work of actually mobilizing the dwarves once again, however, some well-entrenched factions refused his call and challenged his right to rule. Taarqick called out the leader of the largest of these factions, Hrungul Ironeye, to a trial by single combat, which Taarqick narrowly won. Hrungul became one of Taarqick's most fervent supporters and sent his own guards to "escort" other recalcitrant dwarven elders to a ceremony where Taarqick was named High King of the nation of Tar Taargadth, the first dwarf to ever hold such a title.
