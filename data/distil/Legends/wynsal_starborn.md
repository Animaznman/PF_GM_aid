# Wynsal Starborn

# CHANGING OF THE GUARD _Legends_ assumes that Absalom's army narrowly routed Tar-Baphon's forces in the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. Though the captain of the First Guard, Lord **Rothos of House Vastille** (LN male human fighter), fared better than countless other heroes, he was struck with so many wounds and curses that he was forced to retire. His successor is First Siege Gear **Chun Hye Seung** (CG female human engineer), the master engineer formerly in charge of the city's defenses.

WYNSAL STARBORN

# ACTING PRIMARCH OF ABSALOM LG MALE HUMAN FIGHTER To Chun Hye Seung, Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom: Greetings, my friend. Seeing your title written out in full at the top of a missive from the primarch must seem strange. I should know; it was the case when I served as captain, too. Congratulations on your promotion. It is well earned, and my only regret is that Rothos suffered so terribly at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant to create the vacancy you now occupy. He was a good soldier and an even better commander. His reports are certainly much better organized and insightful than mine ever were, so your time reading them will be time well spent.

These are strange days, and this was brought most recently to my attention when I visited a new orphanage opening in Eastgate. It was the Hodley Manor! Over on the Stag Road, where I used to explore as a child. Someone bought the manor, it seems, and renovated it. I didn't have the heart to tell them how all the neighborhood children considered it haunted back in our day.

I can already see your eyebrows coming together in suspicion and concern. Wynsal Starborn, known for blunt forthrightness in decades of service to the First Watch, meandering into an anecdote? Have the years he spent on the Grand Council after his retirement instilled the tendency to circumlocution inherent in all politicians? Has his appointment as Acting Primarch of Absalom, Acting Siege Lord, Acting Protector of Kortos, and Acting Everything-Else-Lord-Gyr-Left- Behind-When-He-Vanished eroded his sanity in the last four years? Not at all. I just feel like I have few true confidants these days. The weight of managing a chaotic and ancient and marvelous city such as ours is crushing, but I can't publicly show it. Some say I've seized power, or engineered a military coup, and that I crave to drop the "Acting" from my title of "Acting Primarch." But you know better, that I'm driven by duty and not desire. If Lord Gyr came back today, I'd be toasting his health in the Little Roofs with my old comrades tonight.

I'm not giving up hope of finding him, or of finding another worthy successor to be primarch. Have you met Watcher-Lord Ulthun II from Lastwall? Seeing a beloved nation destroyed is the greatest burden I can imagine, and he's held up through it all. He's a paragon of resolve. If the Whispering Tyrant is to be the burden of our age, I sometimes think Ulthun should be the primarch to face him. Yet Ulthun has already lost so much to the Whispering Tyrant that perhaps that would be another cruelty heaped upon the pile. I can only hope that Ulthun has confidants in his troubles, and is right this moment penning a letter to a friend, like this one I'm writing to you, sharing his worries and weariness.

I'm far too old now to be naive, but I remain an idealist. Leaders with nobility and a sense of purpose bring out the best in those they lead. My enemies are many, from invaders jealous of Absalom's wealth to career politicians who crave more power (and, frankly, the latter are far more dangerous than the former). These enemies all have one thing in common: they believe rule by force is superior to rule by example. They are wrong.

In your new leadership role, that is probably my most critical advice. Oh, and stay away from Hodley Manor. Just in case. —Wynsal Starborn

To Chun Hye Seung, Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom: Greetings, my friend, though I fear I write to you in the spirit of business rather than companionship. Beside me sits an urgent missive from Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid, warning me of a gnoll slaver and fugitive named Shimon-Je who is running one step ahead of the law. He believes she is traveling to Absalom and has asked us to capture Shimon-Je and return her to Katapesh to face judgment. It's well within his rights to ask, and a task I am eager to perform. You know my

opinions on slavery well by this point, and I am certain you will assign this to your most trustworthy agents.

There are rumors that slavery may soon fall out of favor in Katapesh. Perhaps they are just rumors, but they give me hope. The fires of abolition seem to be catching. I'm proud of my part in that, and what I've done for Absalom. Manumitting all the slaves was the only way this city repelled the Fiendflesh Siege three years ago. There is already a lot of ink spilled about the heroics of the Pathfinder Society, the power of the city's mages leaping to its defense, and the siege weapons you designed and built (and, frankly, cosseted!) in your former role as First Siege Gear. All these helped break the siege, but all of them would have failed if we didn't have the former slaves doing the backbreaking work of defense. They were doing it for themselves, for their own city, and not out of fear of a master's lash. That made all the difference, I believe. The proudest I have ever been of the Grand Council was when they declared slavery and the slave trade illegal throughout Absalom only a few weeks after my order of manumission. It goes to show that sometimes the best in anyone—or any group—comes not by ham-handed force, but by the independence to reach for great things.

In that same vein, I am pleased to say Avarneus from Vidrian has reached out to me again, with questions of diplomatic support. I am happy to give it. Although I consider revolutionaries dangerous, I understand that Vidrian is building something empowering from the ruins of something tyrannical. I support that. Perhaps I ought to introduce Avarneus to Andira Marusek on Andoran's People's Council. Certainly, the two have a common enemy in Abrogail Thrune, and keeping Cheliax in check benefits Absalom. Ah, but that's mercenary of me. These days it seems I can't help but think like that.

With regard to your report on the Spire of Nex, I've received confirmation from Venture-Captain Shevala Iorae that she and the Pathfinder Society are willing to fully cooperate with your efforts. Shevala especially should be a boon, as I doubt there are any who know more about that tower than Nex himself. Though I know better than to tell you how to do your duties for you, permit me to caution all of you to be careful, for my own peace of mind. You and I have stared down a number of sieges in recent years, but seeing the Spire so close in everyday life seems to have a pronounced effect on my worries.

Finally, to your vindication, I must at last concede to your concerns over Lictor Toulon Vidoc. I felt I had nothing to fear from his investigations—I have no political skeletons for him to ferret out from beneath my bed. But you were correct that someone has been feeding him bad evidence, even insisting that I might have had involvement in Lord Gyr's disappearance! Yet though I understand your personal stake in the matter, I reiterate that the First Guard fights Absalom's external enemies, not its internal ones. It is a heavy chain to wear, and one I knew well in my many years of service, but you must wear it. We both have our own battlefields, and you have foes enough on yours to deal with. I will handle mine. —Wynsal Starborn

# EVERYTHING IS POLITICS Wynsal's political situation is a complex one, fitting for a city as complex as Absalom. His initial appointment was to the emergency position of siege lord, when the true primarch of Absalom was found to be missing during an assault on the city known as the Fiendflesh Siege. Wynsal was then declared acting primarch until an official replacement for the position could be found. While Wynsal is happy to cede his position to a legitimately chosen successor, his impeccable character and effective governance have led many to voice their support for Wynsal being appointed to the primarchy in truth. This popularity, especially among Wynsal's former underlings in Absalom's military forces, has caused other political hopefuls to see Wynsal as a threat to their ambitions, and rumors have been spread by the nobility that Wynsal is intending a military coup. That Wynsal has been retired from the military and serving as a politician for over a decade hardly matters, as matters of truth rarely do in politics.
