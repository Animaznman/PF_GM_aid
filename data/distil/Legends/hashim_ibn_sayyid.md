# HASHIM IBN SAYYID

TAPESTRY SITES The following notable sites once dwelt within the famed Hao Jin Tapestry. ONHAE Home to the descendants of the Sunsu Godae people of the Chung Liao jungle, this humble village contained the last vestiges, traditions, and religion of this culture, as well as stories that have otherwise been entirely lost from Golarion.

TAIKAGA TEMPLE One of the first locations that Hao Jin sought to preserve, this temple and its nearby lake were guarded by sovereign dragons who swore an oath that they and all their descendants would help to maintain balance within the tapestry.

THE TEMPLE OF EMPYREAL ENLIGHTENMENT The hilltop Temple of Empyreal Enlightenment was originally from Tianjing, a nation of aasimars. Hao Jin was gifted it so that its beauty and the teachings of Empyreal Lord Korada could be preserved within the tapestry for all time.

MOUNTAIN OF CHAINS The dwarves of this mountain, descendants of the last survivors from the Sky Citadel of Jormundun, lived peacefully until Hao Jin vanished and the magic of her tapestry began to fail, prompting the community to accept aid from the god Droskar.

THE SUNDERED CITY Hao Jin claimed this crumbling ziggurat, part of a massive complex of serpentfolk ruins, to preserve the site and contain the undead serpentfolk still within, though she also accidentally pulled the Muckmouth lizardfolk into her tapestry in the process.

# DECEIVING THE DECEIVERS Hashim is not the only prominent figure in Katapesh who is not as they appear. The Pactmasters are in fact enigmatic aliens known as witchwyrds (*Pathfinder Bestiary 2* 294) who have been ruling Katapesh for centuries. While Hashim's usurpation by Olordaera went unnoticed, the Pactmasters are beginning to suspect something strange is afoot, though they are not yet sure what that may be.

HASHIM IBN SAYYID

PACTBROKER OF KATAPESH LE GENDERLESS VIDILETH INFILTRATOR Within his extravagant chambers above the streets of Katapesh, Hashim sat comfortably in the lavish trappings provided him by the position of Pactbroker. A breeze wafted through the outside patio doors, thrown open and overlooking the busy merchant stalls below. Taking in the abundance of fine food and drink set before him, Hashim brought a jeweled goblet to his nose, and then his true self remembered two things—that it had a very important meeting to attend to, and that it could not bear the scent of wine.

Dumping the drink in his chamber pot far away from him, he returned to face the open air, took a moment to ensure his magical protections were in place, sat in a meditative stance, and closed his eyes. He opened its mind, and the voices came. One from Magnimar, one from the Darklands, and another from Rahadoum. The voices of its fellow veiled masters. Through the shared linking of their minds, they got right to the point.

"Olordaera," asked Yuildoroc, its equal in Rahadoum. "What pact have you brokered with the alchemist Kassi Aziril behind my back, helping her heal the flesh of mortals without magic?"

"One that benefits us both, I assure you," Olordaera replied. "Having such talent promote the anti-deific rhetoric of the Laws of Mortality only yields more subjects willing to turn to us instead of the gods. I provided her an ingredient that only we can harvest, in the depths of the Sightless Sea."

"A favor you should not soon forget," said Uruluura, interjecting from its domain of Orv in the Darklands.

"And what of your folly, Olordaera? What of Shimon-Je?" This was Thulgroon, in Magnimar. Independently of Olordaera's thoughts, Hashim's face clenched in aggravation.

With my agents on her trail, our secret will be safe." A sudden cacophony of voices rose, powerful and loud, and the alghollthu mentally present all withdrew a step inward. Hashim's nose began to bleed. It was the Mhalssthru: the confluence of minds that ruled over and led their kind.

"It is *your* secret that you risk, Olordaera," they said, echoing. "If your plan fails, you will be expunged. Our greater influence must not be discovered."

Just as quickly as it arrived, the mass of voices receded. For a moment, all Olordaera could sense was the fresh pulse of its now-empty mind.

Hashim's eyes fluttered open. He stood, wiped his nose with a handkerchief of imported Tian silk, then turned to the work of putting his plans in motion.

# DEPTHS OF HISTORY Though the unseen and mysterious Pactmasters rule over Katapesh, they leave the enforcement of their decisions and mundane government up to a single appointed Pactbroker. The most recent Pactbroker to be appointed was Hashim ibn Sayyid, a human chosen for his mercantile skill and willingness to uphold the Pactmasters' judgments. Weeks after his acceptance to the post, Hashim ibn Sayyid was murdered and replaced.

The new Hashim is a vidileth—a veiled master—one of the sinister alghollthus. These ancient aquatic beings have meddled in the fate of countless mortals, even warping them into entirely new creatures. They were also the architects of Earthfall, and to this day consider themselves superior to all others, including deities. In their unending desire for control over other species, the alghollthus of Golarion currently have multiple plans in motion. Some, like Olordaera, have
