# HASHIM IBN SAYYID

# DECEIVING THE DECEIVERS Hashim is not the only prominent figure in Katapesh who is not as they appear. The Pactmasters are in fact enigmatic aliens known as witchwyrds (*Pathfinder Bestiary 2* 294) who have been ruling Katapesh for centuries. While Hashim's usurpation by Olordaera went unnoticed, the Pactmasters are beginning to suspect something strange is afoot, though they are not yet sure what that may be.

HASHIM IBN SAYYID

PACTBROKER OF KATAPESH LE GENDERLESS VIDILETH INFILTRATOR Within his extravagant chambers above the streets of Katapesh, Hashim sat comfortably in the lavish trappings provided him by the position of Pactbroker. A breeze wafted through the outside patio doors, thrown open and overlooking the busy merchant stalls below. Taking in the abundance of fine food and drink set before him, Hashim brought a jeweled goblet to his nose, and then his true self remembered two things—that it had a very important meeting to attend to, and that it could not bear the scent of wine.

Dumping the drink in his chamber pot far away from him, he returned to face the open air, took a moment to ensure his magical protections were in place, sat in a meditative stance, and closed his eyes. He opened its mind, and the voices came. One from Magnimar, one from the Darklands, and another from Rahadoum. The voices of its fellow veiled masters. Through the shared linking of their minds, they got right to the point.

"Olordaera," asked Yuildoroc, its equal in Rahadoum. "What pact have you brokered with the alchemist Kassi Aziril behind my back, helping her heal the flesh of mortals without magic?"

"One that benefits us both, I assure you," Olordaera replied. "Having such talent promote the anti-deific rhetoric of the Laws of Mortality only yields more subjects willing to turn to us instead of the gods. I provided her an ingredient that only we can harvest, in the depths of the Sightless Sea."

"A favor you should not soon forget," said Uruluura, interjecting from its domain of Orv in the Darklands.

"And what of your folly, Olordaera? What of Shimon-Je?" This was Thulgroon, in Magnimar. Independently of Olordaera's thoughts, Hashim's face clenched in aggravation.

With my agents on her trail, our secret will be safe." A sudden cacophony of voices rose, powerful and loud, and the alghollthu mentally present all withdrew a step inward. Hashim's nose began to bleed. It was the Mhalssthru: the confluence of minds that ruled over and led their kind.

"It is *your* secret that you risk, Olordaera," they said, echoing. "If your plan fails, you will be expunged. Our greater influence must not be discovered."

Just as quickly as it arrived, the mass of voices receded. For a moment, all Olordaera could sense was the fresh pulse of its now-empty mind.

Hashim's eyes fluttered open. He stood, wiped his nose with a handkerchief of imported Tian silk, then turned to the work of putting his plans in motion.

# DEPTHS OF HISTORY Though the unseen and mysterious Pactmasters rule over Katapesh, they leave the enforcement of their decisions and mundane government up to a single appointed Pactbroker. The most recent Pactbroker to be appointed was Hashim ibn Sayyid, a human chosen for his mercantile skill and willingness to uphold the Pactmasters' judgments. Weeks after his acceptance to the post, Hashim ibn Sayyid was murdered and replaced.

The new Hashim is a vidileth—a veiled master—one of the sinister alghollthus. These ancient aquatic beings have meddled in the fate of countless mortals, even warping them into entirely new creatures. They were also the architects of Earthfall, and to this day consider themselves superior to all others, including deities. In their unending desire for control over other species, the alghollthus of Golarion currently have multiple plans in motion. Some, like Olordaera, have

chosen to take the personas of influential figures of power through shapeshifting, while others have turned to fleshwarping experiments to create more pliable servants, and some pursue secret plots they keep even from each other. Not all veiled masters work together, but they all watch one another, ensuring that their schemes do not threaten to reveal their existence to the world at large. If the plans of an individual veiled master seem doomed to fail in this way, the liability is annihilated. This measure has been enacted twice.

There is a series of four edicts that all alghollthu can recall from within their shared memory. The First Dictum is that life exists to be controlled. The Second Dictum is that to be an alghollthu is to control. The Third Dictum is that alghollthus are eternal as many and one. The Fourth and Final Dictum is that to overreach is to threaten the eternal. It is this last dictum that Olordarea is in danger of breaking; its true identity has been discovered by a gnoll named **Shimon-Je** (NG female gnoll abolitionist), who has thus far evaded capture on multiple counts.

MAKING WAVES An abolitionist gnoll and cleric of Sivanah jailed several times for disrupting Katapesh's slave trade, Shimon-Je has repeatedly escaped permanent incarceration for her efforts. She became a true threat when she accidentally learned of the original Hashim's death, confirming the ruse using a *true seeing* spell. Rumors suggest she has been attempting to make contact with Andira Marusek and her Gray Corsairs of Andoran. Hashim reached out to the interplanar bounty hunter Qiloc (LE female xill ranger) to hunt the gnoll down and has controlled the story outside of Katapesh well enough to convince Wynsal Starborn of Absalom that the gnoll is actually a fugitive slaver. With the Pactbroker's resources allied against her, it seems only a matter of time before Shimon-Je is silenced. For anything else to happen would be catastrophic.

To the rest of the world, Hashim appears to be conducting business as usual, even as he secretly pursues the alghollthu agenda. With the Grey Corsairs engaged in the fight against slavery right on Hashim's doorstep, he has officially requested Wynsal Starborn's help in removing them, yet these requests are seemingly falling on deaf ears, regardless of which trade accords are threatened or brought to bear. Hashim has publicly resigned himself to the Gray Corsairs' attacks but has begun to privately—and deniably—funnel more than a few potent weapons to Andira's rival, Queen Abrogail Thrune II of Cheliax.

Word of Nex's potential return has led Hashim to contact High King Anong Arunak of Dongun Hold, requesting a trade agreement for firearms. If the war between Geb and Nex spreads to other nations, firearms will be crucial for defense. And should Geb and Nex destroy each other, there will be two countries directly south of Katapesh ripe for the taking. Hashim also keeps an eye on Kassi Aziril, to whom he granted a secret ingredient to bolster her medical advances; while he has so far passively supported her to encourage the spread of Rahadoum's anti-theistic beliefs, he expects to collect on that debt when it would be most useful.

Hashim has also used his influence over the city to lay the lines of a mental focus known as a telepathic mesh repeater under the streets of Katapesh and begin a secret coup against the Pactmasters. Once it is active, the range of his mental domination would increase exponentially; he could solidify his rule of the region and potentially reach his mind beyond worlds.

By any method or means, it's time to make his move.

Inestimable Kassi, It has been too long since you graced fair Katapesh with your presence, and it would do me well to lay eyes on you again. There are many here who could

use treatment, and some eager to listen to your speeches on the Laws of Mortality. You know I find those ideas fascinating, even though others do not seem to favor them much. I would love to discuss them together, you and I. You are an incredible person; do not lose sight of that–and do not forget your friend, who have stood with you from the beginning.
