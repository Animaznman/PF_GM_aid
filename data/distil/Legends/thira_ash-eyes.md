# Thira Ash-Eyes

Whatever Tessa's weaknesses, she is frightfully aware of the Chelaxian threat, and devotes many of her resources toward monitoring their movements. Tessa is quick to sniff out Chelaxian rats among the crews of the Free Captains, and Queen Abrogail's navy has lost many vessels in its attempts to capture Tessa's ship, _Luck of the Draw_. Rumors that the navy has recently seized the nautical chop shop Rickety's Squibs to help fashion a new warship capable of taking on _Luck of the Draw_ have merely earned scoffs from Tessa.

Tessa is a generally friendly and easy-going woman, honoring her commitments and proving loyal to her allies. Although she seems careless, she is more calculating than she lets on, and she has a reputation of getting ruthless payback on anyone who crosses her. She is not above using her beauty and reputation—Tessa has had a string of lovers and partners since she became a captain, most lasting no more than a few days. She claims that a broken heart has taught her to love quickly and lightly.

Some say she and Shimali Manux have a history, and that perhaps Shimali is the one who caused that broken heart, though such suggestions tend to quickly burn through Tessa's good humor. The Hurricane Queen's feelings on the Vidric captain do seem conflicted; at times, Tessa laughs at the name, claiming Manux has only luck to thank for her success. Other times, Tessa speaks of Shimali's exploits with admiration, comparing Shimali to some more well-known sailors and even to Tessa herself. Tessa's fickleness draws many questions from her other lieutenants, and the fact that the captains often have their confrontations interrupted by storms and other highly unlikely conveniences has only increased their suspicion.

Another possible culprit is the Vidric councilor Avarneus, whom Tessa claims courted and then betrayed her. Tessa has offered rewards for the capture of Avarneus after the spy ruined more than a few of her carefully laid plans for the invasion of Vidrian; however, she is too impetuous and easily distracted to maintain the sort of subtle hunt that might actually catch Avarneus. Tessa appears content to take her time with dealing with the spy, and Avarneus's newer inventions always seem to eventually make their way to *Luck of the Draw*, as evidenced by the clockwork dragonfly and other innovations stashed in the captain's quarters.

The most tempestuous of Tessa's relationships are those with the Firebrands, particularly the Sapphire Butterfly. In public, Tessa expresses her dislike of the Firebrands, but she has quietly assisted them on occasion. She has also, much to the delight of bards everywhere, had plenty of temporary alliances and assignations with certain Firebrands, which both offer her entertainment and boost her reputation. The Sapphire Butterfly and Tessa have had several encounters in the years since Ravounel's founding, usually when the vigilante is aboard one of the many Vidric ships she uses to traverse the Inner Sea. Each encounter has ended peacefully, however, with the most recent meeting ending with an exchanging of letters between the two. House Thrune's seal on each letter suggests an exchanging of state secrets, but Tessa was quick to hush the whispers aboard her ship when she returned. figure: The lower right portion of a ship with yellow and red hull, visible rigging, and large greenish sails.

# NOTABLE FREE CAPTAINS The following Free Captains have drawn Tessa's attention or ire.

Hurgrar, King of Waves (CE male dwarf pirate): The self-declared king of the Shackles has recently taken to stowing away on other ships and murdering the captains, simply for the sake of chaos. Inexia dis Galazario (LN female human Free Captain): This Chelaxian fugitive rose quickly among the ranks of the Helper's Dance, eventually leading a mutiny. She has since publicly challenged Tessa and sunk the ships of two of Tessa's allies.

**Toba the Tempest (CN male tengu cleric):** The tengu captain has a long history with Tessa, serving as the jinx eater on the *Luck of the Draw* before securing his own ship. He still maintains a close friendship with Tessa.

# THIRA ASH-EYES ## LINNORM KING OF THE THANELANDS N FEMALE HUMAN MAGUS "I am leaving for Valenhall," Sveinn Blood-Eagle said. He spoke quietly, as if to himself. The crackle of fire in the hearth was almost louder than he was. "I will be announcing it in two days." Thira tensed at the words. She closed the scroll she was reading and looked up at her father, standing by the window and looking at the horizon as if he could see Valenhall already. "Then..." she started, but paused. She knew her father well enough. If he had spoken it, then his mind was set. "Then I wish you safe travels," she said instead. She stood up, grabbing her book and her sword. "Are you certain of your choice still?" he asked as Thira reached the door. "You think my brothers more capable?" she asked. "You know I don't," he said, turning to face her. "I only question your choice of prey. The message you will send." Thira stood by the door and looked at him. She could see worry in his eyes, though he wasn't looking at her. He was looking past her. "Do you remember my duel with Josvein all those years ago?" Thira spoke. "Over his mockery when we returned from some hunt?" The hint of a fond smile appeared on her father's face. "I do not remember the hunt itself anymore," Thira continued. "What I do remember is how soundly I thrashed that boy, and how it didn't matter. I was called a cheater for fighting smarter, since I knew I was not as strong. A cheater for using every advantage I had." Sveinn shook his head and looked back out the window. "I paid attention after that. I kept my ears open. I understood. Not only was I raised in the shadows of your heroics and grand accomplishments, but I was also never the tallest and strongest child. Whoever thought of me did not think of Thira Ash-Eyes. They thought of a traitor and a witch. They thought of Sveinn Blood-Eagle's weakling daughter." "You are no weakling," Sveinn said. "No traitor. And no witch." "What I am doesn't matter. When our own people, the so-called friends I grew up with think of me that way, what chance is there that another linnorm king will ever respect me?" Sveinn let the silence stay for a few moments. "I worked hard to earn our lands the respect they deserve," he finally said. "And I will make sure that respect isn't lost," Thira replied. "I will be climbing uphill in a blizzard, but I promise I have thought about every step. We will need a strong and sturdy image when you leave, even if it has to be unfriendly at first." With that, Sveinn nodded with a deep sigh, and Thira left the room. She gathered her traveling gear and was quietly out of Kalsgard before the light of dawn. ## CHALLENGE Thira walked through the snow in the manner the Varki ranger had shown her when she had shared a meal and a span of time with him at his camp. He was Nankou, he had said, and he had slain his own linnorm to lay claim to the throne of Icemark. She had not heard of his victory, she said, but would take word of it to the Thanelands and from there let it spread beyond. She said nothing of his heritage, and what the Ulfen people might think of Nankou taking the title. He said nothing of her father. Thira liked him for that. She had spent a good amount of time researching her plans, focusing on the king whom other kings scouted for, White Estrid. While learning about
