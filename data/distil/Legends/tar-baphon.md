# TAR-BAPHON

With renewed purpose, the dwarves of Tar Taargadth completed the Quest for Sky within a year, discovering they had paused within a thousand feet of the surface.

# SKY CITADELS Following the successful conclusion to the Quest for Sky, Taargick set about attempting to ensure the dwarven kingdom could survive the new dangerous and harsh conditions of the surface world. He drew about him the greatest minds he could find, dwarf and surface-dweller alike, to design massive fortresses that came to be called Sky Citadels. Each of these was the pinnacle of dwarven engineering, architecture, science, and military strategy, designed to serve as fortress, administrative center, city, academy and, in times of great risk, final redoubt.

The first Sky Citadel to be designed was Koldukar, built at one of the sites where the dwarves emerged onto the surface of Golarion. Taargick himself surfaced and saw the sky for the first time at this location, and he intended to make it the center of the kingdom of Tar Taargadth. It was from here Taargick ruled over the nation that bore his name during the height of its success. But they were also years of endless conflict, much of it with Darklands creatures that had been driven before the dwarven march, and Taargick's name was among the most hated by those displaced peoples.

The second Sky Citadel was Dongun Hold, far to the south of the dwarven emergence point on the surface and built as part of an alliance with Osirion. Taarigk envisioned Dongun Hold as the first of many far-flung outposts of Tar Taargadth, connected to one another by tunnels through the upper reaches of Nar-Voth, the uppermost layer of the Darklands. Because Dongun Hold was so far removed from central Tar Taargadth, it was assigned to one of Taarigk's most trusted generals to command, the Mistress-of-Fire Arnhild Arunak.

As Taargick approached an impressive 600th year, a grand tomb was built for him in Koldukar, but the aged High King feared entombing him within it would subject the first Sky Citadel to endless attacks by those who hated his legacy. Instead he abdicated the throne, donned his old adamantine armor, and marched off to find a place to die and be buried in obscurity. Despite his sacrifice, long after Taargick's reign ended, Koldukar fell to orc invaders, who renamed it Urgir and claimed it as the capitol of their own nation.

# ECHOES FROM THE ANCESTORS Taargick remains one of the most revered and beloved of dwarven heroes millennia after his death. His name can inspire dwarves of every heritage, and still rouse anger in traditional enemies of dwarvenkind. A single scrap of adamantine armor with the dwarven runes for the King of Sky has turned up in a small market hidden in the alleys of Absalom, supposedly sold by an adventurer who took it from an orc bandit's corpse. The location of Taargick's final resting place remains unknown, and if orcs have breached that holy site, it is imperative it be located and reconsecrated so the first High King may rest in peace.

And in Dongun Hold, a long sealed-away library was uncovered as High King Anong Arunak prepared the undercity as a shelter for a potential war, and the last papers of Taargick were found. They included a long missive where Taargick admitted his regrets for not seeking a more peaceful solution to the war that drove the orcs from their homeland, and a wish that an orc king existed that Taargick could send his apologies to. High King Anong Arunak thinks she may have found one in Overlord Ardax of Ugrir, yet ponders her next course of action, knowing that such a letter could prove more explosive than the gunpowder in her citadel's stores.

# STRANGE TRUTHS The location of the original homeland of Taargick, Felgunn, has long been lost to time—but an ancient sliver of map on a clay tablet suggests it is located deep below Hagegraf, a major duergar city itself beneath the Five Kings Mountains. The same tablet claims Hagegraf was first named "New Felgunn," which would suggest some dwarves of Felgunn, including some closely related to Taargick, rejected the Quest for Sky and may have been among the first to become duergar. The proof of duergar related to Taargick would send a shock wave through dwarf society, and an expedition would surely be assembled to prove or disprove the theory.

TAR-BAPHON

THE WHISPERING TYRANT NE MALE HUMAN LICH NECROMANCER Countless books tell of Tar-Baphon and his ongoing legacy; entire ancient libraries, saturated with rumors and intrigue, would not be enough to house the documentation of his influence. The record goes thusly: he was once an exceptionally spoiled and gifted student who fell to the temptation of the writings of the last Runelord of Gluttony, Zutha. Tar-Baphon dug a portal to the Negative Energy Plane on the Isle of Terror, ignited a long-lived rivalry with the god Aroden, descended to lichdom, took Ustalav beneath his might, then was imprisoned in Gallowspire and subsequently escaped.

Larger still is his unwritten legacy. His morbid cult of acolytes, the Whispering Way, maintain a 10,000-year-long oral history exchanged only in hushed murmurs. They speak of his leadership with great reverence and eagerly await his plans for the future. These days, the Whispering Tyrant appears not only as a vigilant, violent warlord but as a boogeyman in the minds of even the most innocent; villagers often claim to see him in a farmyard after dark or lurking in a graveyard just at the edge of a mourner's vision. He has escaped from his prison at Gallowspire, where he was once locked in by the *Great Seal*—the name of his prison only flared his ambitious fervor and arrogance when he destroyed it with his magical superweapon, the *Radiant Fire*. Imprisonment on his own throne did not temper his hubris or his ego—it only gave him more time to plot his escape and his plans beyond. Now that he's made his way out, he has only the cruelest of intentions; he plans to leverage his stolen power, his vast legions of enslaved minions, and the Whispering Way to achieve his long-awaited goals.

**THOSE AFFECTED** The Tyrant has perhaps touched as many lives—and deaths and undeaths—as any god. In his calamitous grasp for divinity, he has transformed into something of a miasmatic vertex, connecting vast group of nations and individuals alike simply by means of his generations-long campaign of destruction and fear.

In expanding his power, Tar-Baphon sought to act on the ancient oaths that the orcs swore to him. And yet, when he sent his undead messengers, their mounts were sent back with the corpses of their riders decapitated, and with their proposals stuffed into their exposed necks. The Whispering Tyrant was not accustomed to trifling petulance, and sent an army to force compliance, only to see his forces routed by the united orc holds. To add further insult, the orc overlord Ardax named one of the trophies of his kills—a skull from one of Tar-Baphon's felled minions—after Tar-Baphon and placed cow horns on its head as a mockery of his enemy. The brazen taunt has filled the Tyrant with a renewed wave of malevolence and a determination to strike down the orc's haphazard allegiances. Tar-Baphon's vicious stubbornness is both his virtue and his downfall; the orcs may soon know the brunt of his maliciousness much more intimately.

The nation of Razmiran and Tar-Baphon have entered into something of an unsteady agreement; Razmir has publicly signaled that he will not outright oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as Tar- Baphon does not disturb the realm of Razmiran. This unofficial treaty leaves Razmiran standing among a small host of those neutral on the matter
