# TAR-BAPHON

*What good is existence if not to colonize it? When that veil between the hereafter and the here is lifted by a palm as powerful as the Tyrant himself, then what excuse have we to continue in mediocrity and mortality?* –*Whispers of the Immortal*, author unknown

TAR-BAPHON

THE WHISPERING TYRANT NE MALE HUMAN LICH NECROMANCER Countless books tell of Tar-Baphon and his ongoing legacy; entire ancient libraries, saturated with rumors and intrigue, would not be enough to house the documentation of his influence. The record goes thusly: he was once an exceptionally spoiled and gifted student who fell to the temptation of the writings of the last Runelord of Gluttony, Zutha. Tar-Baphon dug a portal to the Negative Energy Plane on the Isle of Terror, ignited a long-lived rivalry with the god Aroden, descended to lichdom, took Ustalav beneath his might, then was imprisoned in Gallowspire and subsequently escaped.

Larger still is his unwritten legacy. His morbid cult of acolytes, the Whispering Way, maintain a 10,000-year-long oral history exchanged only in hushed murmurs. They speak of his leadership with great reverence and eagerly await his plans for the future. These days, the Whispering Tyrant appears not only as a vigilant, violent warlord but as a boogeyman in the minds of even the most innocent; villagers often claim to see him in a farmyard after dark or lurking in a graveyard just at the edge of a mourner's vision. He has escaped from his prison at Gallowspire, where he was once locked in by the *Great Seal*—the name of his prison only flared his ambitious fervor and arrogance when he destroyed it with his magical superweapon, the *Radiant Fire*. Imprisonment on his own throne did not temper his hubris or his ego—it only gave him more time to plot his escape and his plans beyond. Now that he's made his way out, he has only the cruelest of intentions; he plans to leverage his stolen power, his vast legions of enslaved minions, and the Whispering Way to achieve his long-awaited goals.

**THOSE AFFECTED** The Tyrant has perhaps touched as many lives—and deaths and undeaths—as any god. In his calamitous grasp for divinity, he has transformed into something of a miasmatic vertex, connecting vast group of nations and individuals alike simply by means of his generations-long campaign of destruction and fear.

In expanding his power, Tar-Baphon sought to act on the ancient oaths that the orcs swore to him. And yet, when he sent his undead messengers, their mounts were sent back with the corpses of their riders decapitated, and with their proposals stuffed into their exposed necks. The Whispering Tyrant was not accustomed to trifling petulance, and sent an army to force compliance, only to see his forces routed by the united orc holds. To add further insult, the orc overlord Ardax named one of the trophies of his kills—a skull from one of Tar-Baphon's felled minions—after Tar-Baphon and placed cow horns on its head as a mockery of his enemy. The brazen taunt has filled the Tyrant with a renewed wave of malevolence and a determination to strike down the orc's haphazard allegiances. Tar-Baphon's vicious stubbornness is both his virtue and his downfall; the orcs may soon know the brunt of his maliciousness much more intimately.

The nation of Razmiran and Tar-Baphon have entered into something of an unsteady agreement; Razmir has publicly signaled that he will not outright oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as Tar- Baphon does not disturb the realm of Razmiran. This unofficial treaty leaves Razmiran standing among a small host of those neutral on the matter

of the Tyrant, though it is difficult to distinguish neutral parties from those too terrified to speak. Those listening to the abounding whispers have heard claims that Razmiran may be handing its dead off to Tar-Baphon as payment in exchange for peace, but nothing has been proven beyond furtive rumors.

The knights of Lastwall continue to oppose the Tyrant in every way they can, with heroes such as Kalabrynne Iomedar and Clarethe Iomedar serving on the front lines and former watcher-lord Ulthun II rallying other nations to fight the lich's forces. Tar-Baphon's escape from Gallowspire also caused the self-proclaimed Speaker of All the World's Tales, a half-elf called Janatimo, to advocate for a Magaambyan presence in Avistan in the hopes of studying the Tyrant's escape and helping the survivors of his destruction. Thus far, Tar-Baphon has not paid mind to the many efforts to aid the scattered, desperate populations of the Gravelands, but there is no guarantee that he will merely let them be once he does.

Achakek, the patron god of the Red Mantis assassins, has a long history of thwarting attempts at divinity both with his own power and with the skill of his assassins. Their human leader, Blood Mistress Jakalyn, recently received a mysterious offer of payment for Tar-Baphon's assassination. While not explicitly opposed to Tar-Baphon, the Red Mantis are infamous for ending the aspirations of would-be divine entities. The shadowy messenger, perhaps, hoped to rile the Red Mantis, the Blood Mistress, and their assassins—with Tar-Baphon's well-known attempts at divinity and his many illegitimate reigns, the messenger seemed to believe that this would be an eagerly accepted contract. Blood Mistress Jakalyn, however, knew better than to take the offer at face value and investigated the proposal before deciding whether she would accept it. She discovered that the origin of the offer of payment for Tar-Baphon's assassination was from within Razmiran—obfuscating an already muddy relationship between the two nations.

# MACHINATIONS PRESENT AND FUTURE The machinations of the Tyrant are many, mighty, and all in the interest of expanding his already vast influence on Golarion. The _final blades_ of Galt are of special interest to Tar-Baphon; these guillotines store the souls of their condemned inside of them, and only Galt's executioners, the Gray Gardeners, know how to release the trapped souls. Tar-Baphon does not seek to destroy the blades out of any desire for justice, but simply to break the blood-stained wood open like a pomegranate and take the many trapped souls within to add to his undead hordes. Rumors swirl that the Whispering Way has taken measures to scope out the _final blades'_ locations and their protectors.

His most cherished goal, as it has been since his youth, is ascension to divinity. In 1 AR, Tar-Baphon's rival Aroden lifted the *Starstone* from the bottom of the Inner Sea and became a living god, creating Absalom and the Starstone Cathedral. Since then, the Test of the *Starstone* has allowed anyone who can overcome its many trials to receive divinity. Only three of many have passed, including Iomedae, a follower of Aroden's cause who later became his herald. To Tar-Baphon, the entire test and city smacks of Aroden's smugness and victory— though Aroden may be dead by mysterious circumstances, Tar-Baphon is still not content to leave his rival's successes be. He is not so much interested in taking the test of *Starstone* as he is on taking everything: the cathedral, Absalom, the *Starstone*, all of it. His unfettered ambition will turn a vessel of divinity into a mere plaything for his undying rule.

FAMILIAR FACES The lich Tar-Baphon has been a plague on modern-day Golarion even before he broke free from his prison of Gallowspire to continue his reign of terror. His agents in the Whispering Way concocted a plot to free him in the Carrion Crown Adventure Path, only to be foiled by a group of cunning investigators, as played by the PCs.

Tar-Baphon redoubled his efforts to escape, eventually discovering a means to channel his magic into a devastating discharge known as the *Radiant Fire*. The destruction that followed made up the events of the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. *Legends* assumes that Tar-Baphon's inexorable march on Absalom was ended by a group of tragic heroes whom he had callously slaughtered alongside their neighbors, and who returned from the Boneyard to find a means to stop the Whispering Tyrant by turning his unstoppable arcane power back upon him.
