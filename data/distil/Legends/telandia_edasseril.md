of the Tyrant, though it is difficult to distinguish neutral parties from those too terrified to speak. Those listening to the abounding whispers have heard claims that Razmiran may be handing its dead off to Tar-Baphon as payment in exchange for peace, but nothing has been proven beyond furtive rumors.

The knights of Lastwall continue to oppose the Tyrant in every way they can, with heroes such as Kalabrynne Iomedar and Clarethe Iomedar serving on the front lines and former watcher-lord Ulthun II rallying other nations to fight the lich's forces. Tar-Baphon's escape from Gallowspire also caused the self-proclaimed Speaker of All the World's Tales, a half-elf called Janatimo, to advocate for a Magaambyan presence in Avistan in the hopes of studying the Tyrant's escape and helping the survivors of his destruction. Thus far, Tar-Baphon has not paid mind to the many efforts to aid the scattered, desperate populations of the Gravelands, but there is no guarantee that he will merely let them be once he does.

Achakek, the patron god of the Red Mantis assassins, has a long history of thwarting attempts at divinity both with his own power and with the skill of his assassins. Their human leader, Blood Mistress Jakalyn, recently received a mysterious offer of payment for Tar-Baphon's assassination. While not explicitly opposed to Tar-Baphon, the Red Mantis are infamous for ending the aspirations of would-be divine entities. The shadowy messenger, perhaps, hoped to rile the Red Mantis, the Blood Mistress, and their assassins—with Tar-Baphon's well-known attempts at divinity and his many illegitimate reigns, the messenger seemed to believe that this would be an eagerly accepted contract. Blood Mistress Jakalyn, however, knew better than to take the offer at face value and investigated the proposal before deciding whether she would accept it. She discovered that the origin of the offer of payment for Tar-Baphon's assassination was from within Razmiran—obfuscating an already muddy relationship between the two nations.

# MACHINATIONS PRESENT AND FUTURE The machinations of the Tyrant are many, mighty, and all in the interest of expanding his already vast influence on Golarion. The _final blades_ of Galt are of special interest to Tar-Baphon; these guillotines store the souls of their condemned inside of them, and only Galt's executioners, the Gray Gardeners, know how to release the trapped souls. Tar-Baphon does not seek to destroy the blades out of any desire for justice, but simply to break the blood-stained wood open like a pomegranate and take the many trapped souls within to add to his undead hordes. Rumors swirl that the Whispering Way has taken measures to scope out the _final blades'_ locations and their protectors.

His most cherished goal, as it has been since his youth, is ascension to divinity. In 1 AR, Tar-Baphon's rival Aroden lifted the *Starstone* from the bottom of the Inner Sea and became a living god, creating Absalom and the Starstone Cathedral. Since then, the Test of the *Starstone* has allowed anyone who can overcome its many trials to receive divinity. Only three of many have passed, including Iomedae, a follower of Aroden's cause who later became his herald. To Tar-Baphon, the entire test and city smacks of Aroden's smugness and victory— though Aroden may be dead by mysterious circumstances, Tar-Baphon is still not content to leave his rival's successes be. He is not so much interested in taking the test of *Starstone* as he is on taking everything: the cathedral, Absalom, the *Starstone*, all of it. His unfettered ambition will turn a vessel of divinity into a mere plaything for his undying rule.

FAMILIAR FACES The lich Tar-Baphon has been a plague on modern-day Golarion even before he broke free from his prison of Gallowspire to continue his reign of terror. His agents in the Whispering Way concocted a plot to free him in the Carrion Crown Adventure Path, only to be foiled by a group of cunning investigators, as played by the PCs.

Tar-Baphon redoubled his efforts to escape, eventually discovering a means to channel his magic into a devastating discharge known as the *Radiant Fire*. The destruction that followed made up the events of the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. *Legends* assumes that Tar-Baphon's inexorable march on Absalom was ended by a group of tragic heroes whom he had callously slaughtered alongside their neighbors, and who returned from the Boneyard to find a means to stop the Whispering Tyrant by turning his unstoppable arcane power back upon him.

# THE VIRIDIAN CROWN An artifact thousands of years old, the *Viridian Crown* has been worn by the monarch of Kyonin since the nation was founded. It is claimed to sprout vicious thorns in times of war, though no such sight has been seen under Queen Telandia's rule. That may soon change, however, and elven courtiers watch the queen's circlet for early signs that Telandia's thoughts might turn to battle.

# TELANDIA EDASSERIL QUEEN OF THE ELVEN HOMELANDS

NG FEMALE ELF WIZARD Humans may think they play the game of politics well, but they know nothing of the statecraft of elves, who have centuries at hand to plot and plan. Queen Telandia Edasseril of Kyonin plays that game better than anyone, hence keeping her throne longer than many of her fellow world leaders have been alive. The elven mage rules over her subjects with grace and skill, keeping the nation of Kyonin united despite its citizens' dislike of anything resembling authoritarian commands. She has a steely gaze and a serious demeanor and has been described as looking more like a painting brought to life than a real person. The queen wears the traditional symbol of the Kyonin monarchy, the Viridian Crown: an enchanted circlet made of vines and flowers that change with the seasons. She has scarcely a hair out of place, though occasionally light talon marks grace her skin, a sign of the queen's one passion aside from the throne. She is not only a skilled falconer, but magically assumes falcon form herself, flying alongside her beloved bird, Nyranin.

Telandia was born to nobility, and she learned long ago how to navigate the mazes of the powerful. Though her parents were royalty, they were not the king and queen. With Telandia a potential heir to the throne, they educated her in magic, etiquette, languages, diplomacy, history, and every other topic that could be useful to the budding leader. She made friends with all the most powerful elves, influencing with a light touch yet always making sure that everyone was in her debt, and when the King died without a child, Telandia took the throne.

She continued to ensure she knew all the movers and shakers in the kingdom, including the ambassadors from other lands. This included the Galtan representative Apalma Drannoch and her then-young daughter Camilia. Telandia suspected that the young but very forceful Camilia would grow up to either rule a country of her own or destroy one.

# A ROYAL MATCH Telandia has always willingly sacrificed her personal wants for the good of her subjects, and this remains true for her relationships as well. While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced—good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn't factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are
