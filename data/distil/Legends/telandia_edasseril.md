# TELANDIA EDASSERIL

# THE VIRIDIAN CROWN An artifact thousands of years old, the *Viridian Crown* has been worn by the monarch of Kyonin since the nation was founded. It is claimed to sprout vicious thorns in times of war, though no such sight has been seen under Queen Telandia's rule. That may soon change, however, and elven courtiers watch the queen's circlet for early signs that Telandia's thoughts might turn to battle.

# TELANDIA EDASSERIL QUEEN OF THE ELVEN HOMELANDS

NG FEMALE ELF WIZARD Humans may think they play the game of politics well, but they know nothing of the statecraft of elves, who have centuries at hand to plot and plan. Queen Telandia Edasseril of Kyonin plays that game better than anyone, hence keeping her throne longer than many of her fellow world leaders have been alive. The elven mage rules over her subjects with grace and skill, keeping the nation of Kyonin united despite its citizens' dislike of anything resembling authoritarian commands. She has a steely gaze and a serious demeanor and has been described as looking more like a painting brought to life than a real person. The queen wears the traditional symbol of the Kyonin monarchy, the Viridian Crown: an enchanted circlet made of vines and flowers that change with the seasons. She has scarcely a hair out of place, though occasionally light talon marks grace her skin, a sign of the queen's one passion aside from the throne. She is not only a skilled falconer, but magically assumes falcon form herself, flying alongside her beloved bird, Nyranin.

Telandia was born to nobility, and she learned long ago how to navigate the mazes of the powerful. Though her parents were royalty, they were not the king and queen. With Telandia a potential heir to the throne, they educated her in magic, etiquette, languages, diplomacy, history, and every other topic that could be useful to the budding leader. She made friends with all the most powerful elves, influencing with a light touch yet always making sure that everyone was in her debt, and when the King died without a child, Telandia took the throne.

She continued to ensure she knew all the movers and shakers in the kingdom, including the ambassadors from other lands. This included the Galtan representative Apalma Drannoch and her then-young daughter Camilia. Telandia suspected that the young but very forceful Camilia would grow up to either rule a country of her own or destroy one.

# A ROYAL MATCH Telandia has always willingly sacrificed her personal wants for the good of her subjects, and this remains true for her relationships as well. While Telandia could choose an heir as she herself was chosen, she is keenly aware of the benefits of political marriage for cementing alliances and political power. Queen Telandia has taken her time in the first step of this process: finding a consort. Knowing her nation well, she realized that it would be nearly impossible to avoid political turmoil as she decided who to wed. However, time keeps up even with elves. Telandia chose to travel outside her own kingdom, meeting elves all over Golarion and hoping to find an appropriate match. She found one on a diplomatic mission to the Mwangi Expanse to meet with the elven nations there and to see the ancient elven ruins of Nagisa. The Alijae elves of Nagisa guard the ruins from all outsiders, but they allowed the queen to pay her respects to the site. There, Telandia met an Alijae elf named Zazirele (NG male elf guardian), who is as skilled at training large cats as Telandia is at training birds. Zazirele, a dark-skinned elf with striking orange eyes, was amenable to a marriage with Queen Telandia, though the proposed match took hours of negotiation between the queen and the Alijae and among the Alijae themselves. Zazirele returned with Telandia to Kyonin to spend time in the large elven nation before deciding whether to make the alliance permanent. If the marriage continues as planned, the relationship between the elves of Kyonin and the Mwangi Expanse would be greatly reinforced—good news in the upcoming fight against Tar-Baphon. Love doesn't factor often into royal pairings, but Telandia and Zazirele are

fond of each other, and keen-eyed elves sometimes now spot three birds flying together near the royal residence.

This practice makes the royal guard nervous, as it seems only a matter of time before something happens during one of the queen's flights in bird form. Given that this is her only real pastime that has not been sacrificed on the altar of rulership, the queen refuses to stop flying, even if the land-bound guards can't keep her safe.

# RETURN OF TAR-BAPHON While Kyonin has a reputation of staying out of the affairs of shorter-lived peoples, recent events have demonstrated that Telandia must take a more active approach to global politics. The re-emergence of Tar-Baphon as a threat necessitates action. She has opened Kyonin to outsiders, seeking to gather allies among other nations, preparing for nearly certain war against the powerful lich. The queen is sending out missives to various countries and groups around Golarion, but she doesn't expect all to be immediately receptive of an elven envoy. She sometimes hires groups of the same ancestry or heritage as her target ally to deliver her initial letter, reaching out for a diplomatic relationship and potential alliance.

At the same time, she must placate her own elven subjects, some of whom fear losing their small nation—one of the major bastions of the elven people left on Golarion—to outsiders, and some of whom believe the queen should use her new network of powerful allies to take out Treerazer (*Pathfinder Bestiary* 312) once and for all. While the queen despises the nascent demon lord of pollution and decay, who remains festering in Tanglebriar after he conquered part of Kyonin, she is still reluctant to rekindle an old battle on another front with a new enemy so close at hand. She has been hiring diplomats to speak to the agitators within the kingdom and try to steer them away from talk of starting war with Treerazer.

Queen Telandia began her diplomatic outreach with those countries local to her, and thus far, these olive branches have been generally well received. Grand Princess Eutropia of Taldor sees the benefit of an alliance with the elven kingdom, as does Supreme Elect Andira Marusek of Andoran. High King **Borogrim the Hale** (LN male dwarf high king of Highhelm) of the Five Kings Mountains has always shared good relations with Telandia and recently agreed to an uneasy military alliance—while neither leader enjoys being beholden to send troops to aid the other, they have put that aside for the moment simply due to the magnitude of the threat.

However, Queen Telandia is not open to diplomatic talks with all her neighbors. The oppression of Razmiran disgusts Telandia, and Razmir has declared all elves to be heretical, leaving the two countries effectively at war. While the queen is naturally disinclined to open any discussions with Razmir, she does allow Razmirans to enter Kyonin through their shared border, so long as they are not Razmiran priests. Recently, turmoil along the Razmiran–Kyonin border has Queen Telandia suspicious that Razmiran priests have found their way into her land, though her border guards swear that none have crossed. She suspects that the priests have found another way into her kingdom, and she plans to hire additional forces to figure out how and put a stop to it.

Telandia has also been reluctant to seek alliance with Galt, given the constant turmoil of their government. She is waiting to see how long Citizen Camilia Drannoch, who she knew as a child, can remain leader before perhaps losing her own head.

# DECEIVING APPEARANCES Queen Telandia spends so much of her time on statecraft that many forget her exceptional skill in arcane magic. The royal palace is cloaked from top to bottom in illusions, and servants sometimes interact with a fellow servant that is actually the queen, or a queen that is nothing more than a figment. Most notably, Telandia has permission to scry on many of her loyal subjects, meaning any elf from Kyonin might serve as the queen's eyes.
