# EUTROPIA STAVIAN

"It's real," she told the fisherman. At first, he blinked, taken utterly by surprise. He'd not expected this either, but Nephaira saw hope rekindled in his eyes.

"Is it valuable?" Desperation strained his voice. "My nets are old. My boat leaks. My children shiver for cold, day and night, and we have not enough bread. Can I sell this... this dragon box?"

"The box itself is worth... two and a half weights in gold. Anyone who offers less is trying to cheat you." Privately, Nephaira thought the fisherman would be lucky to get half that sum—his desperation was too obvious, and the nobles' agents didn't get paid for being soft-hearted—but she could at least tell him its true value. Honesty was her watchword.

"I'd like to see what's in it, though," she said.

When the fisherman nodded, Nephaira took out her tools and began cleaning out years of mud and corrosion. Slow going, but eventually she managed.

Inside were... papers. Nephaira removed them one by one, baffled. A hodgepodge of village records, letters from the hinterlands, and other miscellany. The box had been well sealed, and none of the documents evinced water damage, but she couldn't fathom why they would have warranted such protection.

The fisherman waited, fidgeting. "What are they?" Puzzled, Nephaira began reading more carefully. Midway through the fourth letter, it dawned on her. Dragons. The documents were all about dragons. Aggrieved knights seeking recompense for burned lands. Village elders recording the deaths of devoured peasants. Astrologers noting incidental sightings in the sky; physicians requesting burn ointments to treat survivors. Some of the documents were dated. Others referenced contemporaneous events, setting signposts in time. Nephaira searched her memory, measuring what she knew against what she read.

All the sightings matched times when Choral the Conqueror, first king of Brevoy, was known to be in that area—and when the royal red dragons were known to be elsewhere. Each letter was a brick in a wall of proof that Choral was not the human warlord that official historians had always claimed, but was himself a red dragon.

It couldn't be true. It *had* to be true. That ridiculous rumor, so long dismissed as the wild-eyed fancy of amateur cranks, was in fact a truth that Brevoy's early government had gone to great lengths to suppress.

She pushed her chair back, rubbing her eyes again. Outside, the sky had grown dark. She hadn't even noticed the night falling.

The fisherman, who'd dozed off, stirred. "Is it valuable?" Nephaira hesitated. The documents had been hidden, not destroyed, which suggested that someone had seen value in them centuries ago. To blackmail Choral's descendants, perhaps. But now House Rogarvia was vanished without a single survivor, and she couldn't imagine how revealing Choral's true nature would help any of the noble houses maneuvering for Brevoy's throne. The only value she could see was in completing the historical record.

"I don't think so," she answered. "But I'll buy them for a fair price." It was the wrong thing to say. Nephaira saw the fisherman's face harden. Her heart sank as he reached for the papers and swept them back into the box. "I will sell them myself," he said, firmly, and left.

Nephaira sank back into her chair. She didn't see the dark figure that peeled off the hut's shadowed wall to follow the fisherman, and she never learned what happened to the man. All she knew, then and there, was that the box with the dragon seal had been full. Too full to have held everything.

Which meant there were more documents out there, somewhere. And she would find them.

WITH SWORD AND FLAME For ten years, Choral sat on the Dragonscale Throne as the first king of Brevoy, but in all that time, he did little to unite the Issians and Rostlanders as a single people, leaving old divisions to fester while he amassed wealth in his Ruby Fortress. As king, Choral was a remote and terrifying figure, little seen by his people and less loved. Except for his rare, unpredictable tours across Brevoy—tours that he used primarily to visit terrible retribution on wayward vassals, to remind them of the price of disloyalty—Choral rarely left his seat of power in New Stetven. Without Choral or his heirs to maintain unity, the nation of Brevoy has remained split at the seams. Old rivalries and new grudges have pushed the Issians and Rostlanders to the brink of civil war. Yet some few still fear this political infighting will only attract the return and wrath of House Rogarvia, and that those who fight for the right of rule will pay the price for presuming to lay claim to King Choral's crown.

# FAMILIAR FACES Grand Princess Eutropia's struggles to inherit Taldor's rule were the center of the War for the Crown Adventure Path. _Legends_ assumes that Eutropia's agents, as played by the PCs, both aided Eutropia in taking the throne and rescued her resurrected brother, Prince Carrius, from the bizarre plots and circumstances the youth found himself trapped within.

EUTROPIA STAVIAN GRAND PRINCESS OF TALDOR

NG FEMALE HUMAN SWASHBUCKLER 17 Calistril, 4719 My dear charlatans, traitors, backstabbers, vipers, and other colleagues, I arrived in Absalom on the ninth, to try and find what had befallen our mumble-tongued coreligionists. Some dedicated snooping revealed that the Brotherhood of Silence had committed the grave error of getting involved in local politics. (Yes, I am aware of the irony.) Since it doesn't seem like the Brotherhood is going to get out of its defensive crouch anytime soon, I've spent my time putting together a dossier on the cause of their problems, Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian. If nothing else, it might keep us from making the same mistakes in Absalom.

Let's begin with the mundane details. Eutropia is the eldest daughter of the previous ruler, Grand Prince Stavian III, born in 4679 AR. Her brother, Carrius II, is born two years later, and their mother dies shortly thereafter. Nevertheless, her childhood seems happy enough. In 4698 AR, a teenage Carrius dies in an unfortunate accident, and Eutropia breaks with her father. She spends the next decade as a troublemaker and intellectual gadfly. In her thirties, Eutropia settles down into a somewhat more socially acceptable role as dedicated opposition to Stavian's rule. Last year, Eutropia finally pushed a law through the Taldan Senate which repealed agnatic primogeniture and made her the rightful heir.

Whereupon Stavian III launched a royal coup. I won't go into the details of the Taldan War for the Crown, save that it was complicated, multifaceted, occasionally bloody, and that Eutropia won. Two key points, however. First, some bizarre minor cult managed to resurrect the late Carrius II. Then, toward the end of the crisis, our coreligionist Rhien secretly murdered Eutropia on the orders of some secret society or other, which led to Carrius II briefly ruling Taldor. Eutropia's agents managed to resurrect her, Carrius stepped down, and Eutropia became grand princess; public opinion is that she faked her death. Their skepticism is unsurprising, given Eutropia seems to have weathered her own homicide without so much as a chipped nail or ruffled feather. Really, the agents even resurrected the dog that Rhien killed during the assassination (named Taldogis, on which I have no comment), so as to magically question the poor canine. I am gravely disappointed in the quality of assassination in this country. No one stays dead.

Which brings us to today. Eutropia is the newly minted grand princess, the first woman on the Taldan throne, with her younger brother Carrius II at her side, as well as her faithful Taldogis.

Last night, I weaseled my way into a royal salon and managed to speak with Eutropia for about an hour before Lady Gloriana Morilla recognized me and I had to escape the Ulfen Guard by way of a dumbwaiter. Eutropia is a canny politician and a dedicated Taldan patriot, but underneath I found her rather melancholy. Her brother's death and subsequent resurrection, her father's dementia, and her own struggles for the throne weigh on her, and though things seem to be on the upturn, I suspect she's still waiting for fate's next blow to fall. The only time she seemed truly happy was when speaking of her catch-dog, or talking about sport fencing, during which she betrayed a downright impish sense of humor.

With regards to politics, Eutropia is a moderate reformer. She won the throne by carefully maneuvering between rival powers, sometimes displaying honest compassion, sometimes brutal efficiency, and sometimes level-headed practicality. For the moment, she's been
