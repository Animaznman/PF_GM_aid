# Toulon Vidoc

# MISSING IN ACTION Lictor Vidoc has pressed his agents to determine whether there are any survivors of the Order of the Coil in Vidrian who might be debriefed about that Order's fate. The Order of the Scourge suspects that the Coil may have overstepped its bounds, and thus their interest is not to visit retribution on Vidrian's revolutionaries. However, because of the Coil's past abuses, Hellknights are unwelcome in Vidrian. Accordingly, Lictor Vidoc has been forced to work through intermediaries.

TOULON VIDOC

LEADER OF THE ORDER OF THE SCOURGE LN MALE HUMAN HELLKNIGHT The charming, capable Lictor Toulon Vidoc is the leader of the Hellknight Order of the Scourge, the oldest Hellknight order and the one perhaps most often at odds with Cheliax's ruling houses. The Order of the Scourge is dedicated to apprehending criminals of every stripe, from street toughs and isolated serial killers to corrupt merchants and casually murderous aristocrats who use their positions to cover their crimes. In Cheliax, investigating the misdeeds of the powerful often ends poorly for the investigator, but Lictor Vidoc's deft political maneuvering and the long list of nobles who owe him personal favors have given the Scourge Hellknights a relatively free hand to pursue their duties. Without the lictor's influence, it is likely that the Order of the Scourge would have run afoul of House Thrune long ago.

Toulon Vidoc was born to a prosperous merchant family in Egorian. He joined the dottari as a youth, but as he was not of the nobility, his prospects for advancement were slim. Nevertheless, he applied himself energetically to the work, learning investigative techniques and developing the beginnings of an informant network that would serve him throughout his career. Whenever the young dottari encountered someone who took policing seriously, he applied himself to learning whatever he could from such masters, irrespective of their rank or background. This made him an anomaly in Egorian's status-obsessed society, where one's family name was often more important than one's deeds.

Vidoc left the dottari after two of his cases ended in frustration. In the first, he uncovered a nest of Skinsaw cultists who had been murdering slum dwellers in Egorian. He believed—and believes to this day—that Asmodean aristocrats used the cult killings to cover their own murders, which were attributed to the Skinsaw cult and the cases officially closed despite Vidoc's protests. He still wonders who those Asmodeans were, and why his superiors were so adamant that the case be closed.

The second case struck closer to home. Vidoc's parents were ruined when a ship in which they'd been heavily invested was seized by pirates in the Shackles. The cargo was lost along with all hands—an unusual level of savagery that tipped Vidoc off to the probability that the massacre was meant to cover something. Vidoc began investigating and soon determined that a competitor had deliberately betrayed the ship's route and defenses to ensure that his own ship's cargo would be the only one to arrive safely, thereby tripling his profits. However, the conspirators in the Shackles were no ordinary pirates but something far worse, and not remotely human. figure: partial image of a black and red object or creature appears in the left margin, partially visible and cut off.

Before Vidoc could finish his investigation, it was shut down unceremoniously. Egorian's dottari had no authority to investigate anything in the Shackles. His personal interest, given the loss of his parents' fortune, made his involvement suspect. And the Egorian merchant who had orchestrated the scheme died suddenly, under mysterious circumstances, leaving no culprit left to bring to justice in Cheliax.

# THE ROAD TO HELL Frustrated, Vidoc left the dottari and joined the Order of the Scourge. Here, his lack of noble ancestry posed no obstacle, and he rose quickly through the ranks. Toulon Vidoc rapidly developed a reputation for precise thinking, dogged determination, and tremendous personal courage. His years navigating Egorian's politics also left him far more adept at manipulating the levers of power than most Hellknights could ever be.

Within less than a decade, Vidoc rose from a rank-and-file Hellknight to lictor. He shaped the Hellknights under his command in his own image, constantly exhorting them to develop new policing strategies, build up informant

networks, earn the trust of the populace, and never flinch from bringing wrongdoers to justice. At the same time, he cultivated grateful nobles throughout Chelaxian society, ensuring a certain level of autonomy and protection for his investigators.

His career has been burnished by his Order's successes. Five years ago, Vidoc secretly captured the Bellflower Network's previous leader, Farmer **Hannelore Fallows** (NG female halfling abolitionist). The hellspawn Hellknight **Jheraal** (LN female tiefling^APG human hellknight) solved a series of unsettling murders in Westcrown, ultimately tracing them to agents of the graveknight Order of the Crux. Master of Blades **Uldrannas Haelcant** (LG male human hellknight) continues to pursue a 40-year-old ring of necromantically influenced organ harvesters and kidnappers. Though he has not succeeded in apprehending its ringleaders, he has greatly diminished its activity.

The Order of the Scourge, under Lictor Vidoc's guidance, has also taken a passing interest in the disappearance of Absalom's primarch, Lord **Gyr of Gixx** (N male human rogue), and the appointment of Wynsal Starborn as acting primarch in Gyr's place. The Hellknights' interest is to ensure that Absalom continues to run smoothly, as the city-state is too important a trading power to be allowed to slip into chaos.

Vidoc's accomplishments unsurprisingly drew the attention of Queen Abrogail II of Cheliax. While Vidoc had so far managed to maneuver around Abrogail's interest in him—an interest he believes may have bordered on the romantic more so than the political—he recently earned her scrutiny due to Order of the Scourge's investigation into the queen herself. The Order posits that Abrogail may have had a hand in Cheliax's recent turmoil for political or financial gain. News of Abrogail's attempts to hire Blood Mistress Jakalyn to dispatch the queen's enemies, potentially including members of the Order of the Scourge, have only pushed this investigation to the Order's highest priority. Vidoc has halted the investigation for the moment as he considers his strategy, but stirrings throughout the Order of the Scourge suggest that the Hellknights will not be daunted by Abrogail and the investigation will be moving forward. A conflict between these powers seems near inevitable.

# OLD FAVORS A peculiarity of Toulon Vidoc's early career was his lack of interest in claiming credit for his successes. It was the work itself that absorbed him, not the acclaim that followed. While Vidoc was quick to volunteer for the hardest cases, he was also happy to let other dottari claim credit for the apprehensions. These

traits made him invaluable to many of Egorian's ambitious young officers, who lacked his skills but had the right names for promotion. To this day, many senior officers in Egorian's dottari owe their positions

to Toulon Vidoc, who earned the laurels that they've been resting on ever since. While Vidoc has never actually threatened to expose such

frauds, these senior dottari are acutely aware that he could, and as such, they have a strong interest in accommodating Vidoc's requests.
