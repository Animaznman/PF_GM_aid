# Ardax the White-Hair

OVERLORD OF THE HOLD OF BELKZEN NE MALE ORC BARBARIAN ROGUE The land of Belkzen is harsh, and the orcs that call it home know this better than any. The various orc holds have, for most of Golarion's history, fought fiercely with one another, trading leadership at the edge of a blade and holding it through fear until death comes at the hands of another. Yet even death has not moved the orc warlord Grask Uldeth from the throne of Urgir. He sits there now, his desiccated eyes still seeming to stare at the blade in his chest, its slowly corroding point pinning him to the throne he guarded so cautiously.

None are sure how the assassin slipped past the Closed Fist patrols and through the ranks of Empty Hand warriors to plunge the sword into Uldeth, but none doubt the devotion Uldeth's advisor and majordomo, Ardax the White-Hair, still holds for his overlord. Within hours of Uldeth's assassination, the fearsome Ardax cornered the killer in a subterranean section of Urgir and slew them with little ceremony.

Though Ardax didn't claim the throne from the former warlord, he was quick to consolidate power. He assumed the role of acting overlord, though he still refers to himself as the steward of Urgir—Ardax is quite capable of ruling from his own Halls of the Closed Fist and shuns the trappings of lofty titles. His pragmatism and disdain for typical displays of strength and power have led to rumors that the Throne of Urgir is cursed. Why else would Ardax refuse to take it?

# TERRIFYING WISDOM Ardax is highly unusual among the orcs of Belkzen for having lived to middle-age, avoiding an untimely death in the many battles and power struggles that plague that land. His age aside, Ardax is a perplexing sight among his kin: where most orcs have dark hair (or bald heads) and fearsome spiked armor, Ardax keeps his white hair held in a tight topknot and wears simple, close-fitting hide armor. He uses the confusion caused by this image as a tool of intimidation, appearing unarmed before other warlords, figure: The left edge of the image contains a partial illustration of a curved, dark horn or tusk, possibly part of a stylized orc or creature. The figure is cropped and does not show a complete subject.

flanked only by a rust monster for protection. **K'zaard the Drover** (NE male orc barbarian), leader of the Cleft Head orcs, once spent so much of his meeting with Ardax looking for a weapon on him that K'zaard could remember little else of the meeting, let alone what he had agreed to. Ardax has an uncanny knack for divining useful information. Against the advice of the Twisted Nail hold, Ardax sent a small raiding party with the goblin **Igaz** (CE male goblin rogue) to find a supposedly hidden dwarven fort. To the surprise of all but Ardax, the party returned two weeks later hauling cartloads of dwarven armor, weapons, and artifacts. Likewise, Ardax's efforts have deeply frustrated spymasters across the Inner Sea region; their agents have spent months attempting to infiltrate Urgir and learn more about its calculating new overlord, but no matter their approach, no agent has succeed in passing through the gates of Urgir undiscovered. This constant thwarting of espionage has drawn a significant amount of interest from many who would otherwise ignore the political machinations of orcs.

Rumors of Ardax's mysterious powers of insight abound, increasingly so since the stoic orc has been seen walking the ramparts of Urgir with the former Runelord Sorshen. Her ambassadors arrived in Urgir when orcs began fleeing into her territory after Tar-Baphon escaped Gallowspire. Ardax considered pursuing the cowards to be wasted effort and allowed the fleeing orcs to stay in New Thassilon, asking only for their names. This response seems to have gained a

small amount of favor with Sorshen, who has since visited Ardax a handful of times. Though wary of her incredible power, Ardax is glad to have sown the seed of alliance with someone feared by those who may wish him harm.

# THE BATTLE OF NINE BROKEN SKULLS When the undead came to Urgir, looking to reaffirm the ancient oaths the orcs' ancestors pledged to Tar-Baphon, Ardax wasted no words on them: he had the envoys cut down as soon as they had finished their speeches. He then hung their heads on the walls of Urgir and sent their mounts back over the border dragging the messengers' corpses behind them, Tar-Baphon's proposals stuffed into their necks.

Tar-Baphon responded by sending a detachment of troops to crush the older orc and his forces, expecting the oft-fractured orc holds to fall easily. Ardax instead rallied a desperate coalition of orcs into one army, using Urgir as their fortress. When the long battle ended with the total rout of the Whispering Tyrant's forces before the united strength of the holds, Ardax strode into the field and claimed ten skulls from the fallen undead. Nine times, Ardax held a skull in the air before the gathered might of the orcs. He named each after an enemy overcome by orcs' strength and crushed them in his hands. The tenth he named Tar-Baphon and left whole, adorned with cow horns as a mockery of the Tyrant. He keeps the tenth skull nearby, bearing it as a reminder of the orcs' shared enemy.

# BELKZEN, A FRAGILE NATION The Battle of Nine Broken Skulls cemented Ardax as the effective leader of the orc holds, and the remaining orc lords declared him overlord in the wake of their victory. Ardax accepted and has busied himself since with matters of state, trying to keep his fragile alliance from falling apart while working toward a self-sufficient Belkzen. The war machines left intact after the battle with the undead were repurposed into plows, and the hold of Regnat

the Green (CN male orc druid) of the Storm-Screamers was given the oversight of potential crops in the churned and drying mud left by the retreating waters on the Flood Road. In recognition of the Burning Sun's contribution in battle, Ardax gave the Sarenite orc hold sole rights to a stretch of hunting grounds bordering the Gravelands. Immediately following this edict, the Twisted Nail threatened to retaliate against Ardax, claiming the Burning Sun had no right to that land. Ardax responded by giving the Twisted Nail hold the honor of negotiating peace with Sheblis and Tyrkalis, the two red dragons living in the Tusk Mountains.

Outside of Belkzen, Ardax has sent emissaries south to the nation of Oprak in hopes of allying with General Azasersi. Though it seems a natural alliance, negotiations with the hobgoblin nation have been tense and slow to resolve. The orc leader of the newly unified Belkzen remains hopeful that both nations can work together and establish their legitimacy against fear and disgust from the human-dominated nations. For if Belkzen is to survive another attack from the undead or an opportunistic assault by another nation, it must make new alliances.

# DESPERATE TIMES Ardax has not been shy in seeking allies against the looming threat of Tar-Baphon's reprisals. Caravans claiming to have been saved from roving undead by orc patrols have arrived in cities near Lake Encarthan, with letters bearing the seal of Overlord Ardax the White-Hair. The letters have already reached the knight Kalabrynne Iomedar on the fringes of the Gravelands, and others offer rewards to anyone willing to carry diplomatic messages from Urgir to other nations of the Inner Sea region.
