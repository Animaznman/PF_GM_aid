# TESSA FAIRWIND

fond of each other, and keen-eyed elves sometimes now spot three birds flying together near the royal residence.

This practice makes the royal guard nervous, as it seems only a matter of time before something happens during one of the queen's flights in bird form. Given that this is her only real pastime that has not been sacrificed on the altar of rulership, the queen refuses to stop flying, even if the land-bound guards can't keep her safe.

# RETURN OF TAR-BAPHON While Kyonin has a reputation of staying out of the affairs of shorter-lived peoples, recent events have demonstrated that Telandia must take a more active approach to global politics. The re-emergence of Tar-Baphon as a threat necessitates action. She has opened Kyonin to outsiders, seeking to gather allies among other nations, preparing for nearly certain war against the powerful lich. The queen is sending out missives to various countries and groups around Golarion, but she doesn't expect all to be immediately receptive of an elven envoy. She sometimes hires groups of the same ancestry or heritage as her target ally to deliver her initial letter, reaching out for a diplomatic relationship and potential alliance.

At the same time, she must placate her own elven subjects, some of whom fear losing their small nation—one of the major bastions of the elven people left on Golarion—to outsiders, and some of whom believe the queen should use her new network of powerful allies to take out Treerazer (*Pathfinder Bestiary* 312) once and for all. While the queen despises the nascent demon lord of pollution and decay, who remains festering in Tanglebriar after he conquered part of Kyonin, she is still reluctant to rekindle an old battle on another front with a new enemy so close at hand. She has been hiring diplomats to speak to the agitators within the kingdom and try to steer them away from talk of starting war with Treerazer.

Queen Telandia began her diplomatic outreach with those countries local to her, and thus far, these olive branches have been generally well received. Grand Princess Eutropia of Taldor sees the benefit of an alliance with the elven kingdom, as does Supreme Elect Andira Marusek of Andoran. High King **Borogrim the Hale** (LN male dwarf high king of Highhelm) of the Five Kings Mountains has always shared good relations with Telandia and recently agreed to an uneasy military alliance—while neither leader enjoys being beholden to send troops to aid the other, they have put that aside for the moment simply due to the magnitude of the threat.

However, Queen Telandia is not open to diplomatic talks with all her neighbors. The oppression of Razmiran disgusts Telandia, and Razmir has declared all elves to be heretical, leaving the two countries effectively at war. While the queen is naturally disinclined to open any discussions with Razmir, she does allow Razmirans to enter Kyonin through their shared border, so long as they are not Razmiran priests. Recently, turmoil along the Razmiran–Kyonin border has Queen Telandia suspicious that Razmiran priests have found their way into her land, though her border guards swear that none have crossed. She suspects that the priests have found another way into her kingdom, and she plans to hire additional forces to figure out how and put a stop to it.

Telandia has also been reluctant to seek alliance with Galt, given the constant turmoil of their government. She is waiting to see how long Citizen Camilia Drannoch, who she knew as a child, can remain leader before perhaps losing her own head.

# DECEIVING APPEARANCES Queen Telandia spends so much of her time on statecraft that many forget her exceptional skill in arcane magic. The royal palace is cloaked from top to bottom in illusions, and servants sometimes interact with a fellow servant that is actually the queen, or a queen that is nothing more than a figment. Most notably, Telandia has permission to scry on many of her loyal subjects, meaning any elf from Kyonin might serve as the queen's eyes.

# FAMILIAR FACES Tessa Fairwind appeared as a member of the Pirate Council in the Skull and Shackles Adventure Path. While she initially had no desire to take the title of Hurricane Queen, Legends assumes the likeliest candidates for the role—as played by the PCs—had no wish of it either, prompting Tessa to eventually claim it.

# TESSA FAIRWIND ## HURRICANE QUEEN OF THE SHACKLES CN FEMALE HALF-ELF PIRATE Tessa Fairwind cuts a striking figure on the prow of her ship, its proud mast and pirate flag a challenge to everyone who sees it. She can hear the welcoming shouts from other captains, the roar of commerce—the bustle and chaos of Port Peril.

This is her city, her seat of power. The Hurricane Queen has come home, triumphant over Cheliax yet again.

# SCOURGE OF CHELIAX Tessa was born on the sea, the product of a brief affair between a human merchant and an elven priest of Calistria. She learned to walk on the pitching decks of her mother's ship, and by the time she could talk, she was helping the sailors tie knots. She was her mother's pride and despair, stealing a boat when she was only 8 years old. Her mother found her, unrepentant, in the hands of the guards and judged, correctly, that this was only the start of greater delinquency. She signed her daughter over to Captain **Karise** (N female human ship captain), a stern friend who plied dangerous routes through the High Seas with her crew.

Under Karise's care, Tessa quickly became a competent sailor, but her wild streak never settled. At 15, she stole a Thuvian pleasure barge on a dare. Thuvian guards chased her for days before she pillaged and abandoned the barge. She escaped their grasp, but her fate was sealed by a price placed on her head. Within 3 years, her name was blazoned across the Inner Sea region, and she sailed through the arch of Aroden into the Arcadian Ocean to evade her pursuers.

Tessa set her sights on Cheliax early on, harassing their shipping routes and playing merry havoc with their interests. She scored many victories, and the price on her head nearly quadrupled before she turned 20. She made her fortune off of Cheliax's woes.

In the autumn of her twenty-third year, Tessa was caught in a trap laid by a Chelaxian captain who had been hunting her. Her ship was badly damaged, and she was knocked overboard. Chelaxian sailors scooped her up as she floated, stunned and badly wounded. She spent 2 years in a hard labor camp in the Menador Mountains before escaping.

Tessa never showed much political drive in her early life, but her prowess and reputation as a pirate captain quickly elevated her to the Pirate Council. Very soon after, she claimed the port of Quent as her home base and was declared the town's Mistress. She worked tirelessly to root out the traitors to the previous Hurricane King, with little success. When he fell, she eventually (though somewhat reluctantly) took the title of Hurricane Queen with her strength and guile.

Tessa rules from her town house in Port Peril, on Motaku Isle, venturing into the Shackles only when needed for official business. She isn't fond of the intrigues and endless paperwork she has found herself saddled with, but her generally affable nature and curiosity suit her new role well.

# THE EYE OF THE STORM Tessa never deliberately sought the title of Hurricane Queen, as she preferred a carefree lifestyle, but she has found that power offers her a refuge from consequences that she didn't have before. This rush of freedom has made Tessa somewhat reckless, and while that recklessness allows bold successes like Tessa's recent raid on Cheliax, it has left more cautious pirates worried about the inevitable backlash. Some of the other pirate lords regard Tessa as a weak and irresponsible leader, someone unworthy of representing and guiding them. Others simply covet her position or are actively scheming against her in order to open the way for a Chelaxian invasion. For now, however, Tessa is too popular to challenge, and she's very skilled at finding ways to increase that popularity.
