# Bort's Caravan and Crew

crisscrossing his face from years of bar fights. He is
one of Vilree's servants in town, and he is the one
who accepts the shipment from Bort when
the caravan first arrives. Hallod is
also the one who bullies Phinick
into poisoning the merchant. PCs
can find Hallod in the Feedmill
at night or in his shack at the
northern edge of town. Hallod
appears in area F of the adventure,
which starts on page 15.

little, as most justice in Etran's Folly is
metered out with crude blades or farm
tools long before he arrives. Rolth's
only real job is to handle disputes
between farmers over crops
and livestock. Rolth is lazy and
not too bright, and he is so out of
shape that most who want to avoid
his justice need only to run away.
When Bort is murdered, Rolth's only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth.

Kolnral Brannak (NG male human server): Kolnral is one of two servers at the Feedmill, along with Trin Sathern, and is quite skilled at his job. His wife and child also tend to a small plot on the eastern side of town to bolster the family's income. Kolnral is friendly but not too interested in talking to strangers.

Noala Kesrir (NG Female Elf Ranger):
Noala came to the region of Etran's Folly about 10 years ago, settling here after serving as a mercenary in the Goblinblood Wars. Toward the end of that struggle, she was caught inside a burning building during a raid. Her right arm was terribly burned in the fire, making that hand all but useless. As a result, she wears a custom leather gauntlet over her right hand that allows her to fire her bow, but it reduces her accuracy.

Noala thinks of herself as a steward of these
lands, even though no one else seems to recognize
her as such. She is rarely found in town unless
needed, instead preferring to work in the wild,
preserving the delicate balance in the woodlands
around the community. Only Delma seems to
recognize and appreciate Noala for all she does
for the town.

Phinick Padley (CN male goblin helper):  
Performing all sorts of odd jobs around the Feedmill, Phinick can most often be found helping with inventory in the morning, then transitioning over to help Amora in the kitchen in the afternoon. Phinick is tolerated by the townsfolk, but only barely—a fact that keeps him on edge. The twitchy goblin is rather timid and shy around big folk, trying too hard to fit in. Phinick is bullied into adding a special "spice" to Bort's food in Part 1 of the adventure, and he quickly goes into hiding after the merchant's death. For more on Phinick, see Chasing Phinick on page 14.

**Roth Garley (LN male human sheriff):** Roth is the only law in town, but he does relatively

when Bort is murdered, Roth's only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth.

Sir Lawren Krent (LG male human ex-paladin): Poor Sir Lawren arrived here a few months ago when the caravan he was traveling with left without him. Disgraced and drunken, Sir Lawren saw things during the fall of Lastwall that he cannot unsee without the aid of strong drink. He can most often be found drinking in the tavern of the Feedmill or passed out in a lean-to shelter nearby.

**Targen Fulst (CG male human mayor):** Targen was known around town as being a bit forgetful 20 years ago, but at age 80, he is mostly infirm, with poor eyesight and trouble walking more than a few steps at a time. His memory is now badly failing him, and he has trouble remembering the name of his daughter Delma, sometimes referring to her as Reganna, his long-passed wife. The entire Fulst family is related to Etran Bolmere, who founded the town a few hundred years ago.

Although Targen has long abdicated any mayoral responsibilities, the town has yet to name a new mayor, seeing no need with so few inhabitants. Targen lost most of his family to goblins in the Goblinblood war, and as a result, he is very distrusting of any goblin characters he might meet, keeping an eye on them and clutching at valuables. However, he has grown to tolerate Phinick.

**Trin Sathern (NG female human server):** Working every night at the Feedmill, Trin dreams of escaping Etran's Folly. She desperately wants to leave this place and make a new life for herself in Almas or some other city. If the players show any sign of helping her leave town, she becomes especially friendly, as the thought of getting out of the place is almost intoxicating to her. She is excited to hear any tale about faraway lands or unfamiliar places.

BORT'S TALES
The following are just a sample of the outlandish stories told by the traveling merchant Bort Bargith. These tales are so practiced that Bort receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Perform checks to impress when he uses one of them and to any Deception check he attempts to defend the tales' more outlandish claims.

**Bort and the Chilled Giant:** In this tale, Bort was traveling through one of the high mountain roads in the Five Kings Mountains when his caravan was captured by a fire giant. As Bort was being lowered into a kettle, he managed to trick the giant into using a rare plant called "frostbloom" in his soup, claiming it was quite spicy. When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.

**Pharasma's Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort's boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well.

BORT'S CARAVAN AND CREW
Traveling all around the Five King's Mountains and into the lands beyond, Bort's Merchant Caravan is well known and regarded as a fair and honest purveyor of goods, raw materials, and supplies.

**Bort Bargith (NG male dwarf merchant):** Bort keeps his prodigious beard immaculately trimmed and well maintained. Bort is a friendly, honest merchant, who prides himself on having whatever a small community might need. He's warm and caring toward the members of his crew and polite and courteous to his paying passengers. He can often be found with a mug of ale in one hand and savory food in the other, telling some outlandish story about his travels, which generally involves him getting out of danger in the most ridiculous of ways (see the Bort's Tales sidebar). He is slow to anger, quick to laugh, and more than capable of verbally dancing out of any danger.

Cooky (LN old male elf cook): Aged even for an elf, Cooky's real name is Talair Starlight, although only Bort knows that. To everyone else he is Cooky, the merchant caravan's resident cook—although some call him "cocky" behind his back, owing to the fact that he only has one ear and is constantly tilting his head to one side to compensate. Attached to the back of Cooky's wagon is a large iron pan that can hold hot coals and even burning logs, allowing him to slow cook stew in a pot above the flames, even while travelling. Cooky has a hard time hearing most folk, although many of the others in the caravan think he can hear just fine and chooses to ignore others when they irritate him.

**Glunda Grapeleaf (N female gnome teamster):**
Born in heart of the Fangwood, Glunda has always had a strong tie to the beasts and plants of the world. When she was taken in by the druids in Crystalhurst, she developed her skills, even learning to speak with animals. Her time with the druids was not to last, for soon after the desire to wander called to her, and she left Nirmathas, joining up with Bort's caravan to travel and see the world. Glunda regularly uses her rudimentary skills to speak to the pack animals and tend to their needs. She almost never talks to anyone other than Tamli and Bort unless absolutely necessary, preferring to sleep near the animals rather than gather round the fire.

Olf and Ulf Redfren (CG male human teamsters):
Hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twin Ulfen brothers used to be part of a merchant vessel that plied the waters of Lake Encarthan, but when war came the region, the boat was sunk and the two barely made it to shore alive. They signed up with Bort soon after. These gregarious brothers like to play pranks on the other members of the caravan and their traveling companions and frequently dress alike and try to confuse people as to who is Olf and who is Ulf.

Tamli Grent (LN female half-orc chief): If Bort is the smiling face behind the caravan, Tamli is its overseer. As Bort's second in command, Tamli oversees the other staff and wagons in the train, making sure that all are in good spirits and good working order respectively. She is skilled at handling beasts of burden, but stern with the other members of the caravan. Her personal manner with outsiders and passengers are a bit brusque and awkward. She carries a lock of hair on a leather cord around her neck that's from her son, who she lost years ago when she fled from Belkzen. She doesn't like to talk about it with those she doesn't trust. The only person she regularly confides in is Bort, although she can often be heard barking orders at the other members of the caravan.
