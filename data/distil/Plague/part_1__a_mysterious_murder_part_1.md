# Part 1: A Mysterious Murder

FIRST FIGHT
As the battle with the wolves is the first
time the PCs have entered battle, it is important
to take your time and ensure that the combat
is fun and engaging. The mangy wolves do not
present much of a threat, but the caustic wolf is
a dangerous foe that can seriously hurt the player
characters. Fortunately, the wolves do not use
effective tactics. They do not intentionally move
into flanking positions, nor do they single out
weak characters. The caustic wolf uses his howl
early in the fight and his acid breath only once he
has been damaged. Should the fight turn against
the players, Olf and Ulf might show up to draw
the wolves off for a round or two, giving the PCs
a chance to regroup.
     Most importantly, emphasize the sights,
sounds, and smells of the fight. The wolves snarl
with hunger and smell like filthy hounds. The mud
flies when characters charge across the damp
trail. Fangs tear nasty wounds, and warhammers
crunch bones. Play up any critical hits and
exaggerate the failures. Make sure everyone's
first fight is one they will vividly remember.

Acid Breath Two Actions The wolf unleashes a stream of bright green acid from its mouth, coating all creatures in a 30-foot line. All creatures in the line take 3d6 acid damage (DC 16 basic Reflex save). The caustic wolf cannot use this ability again for 1 minute.

Howl ![inline micro-figure: double black chevrons] The wolf unleashes a terrifying howl, allowing it to Demoralize all enemies within 30 feet. Wolves within 100 feet can spend a reaction to join the howl, causing the effect to emanate from them

as well. This affects additional enemies within 30 feet
of them and uses the caustic wolf's Intimidation check
with a –4 circumstance penalty. Enemies cannot be
affected by the howl more than once, even if
they are near more than one howling wolf.
All creatures targeted by this effect are
temporarily immune for 24 hours.

For details on the town and its notable  
locations, see page 51.

As they pass through the middle of town,
the wagons go around the ancient
plaguestone, a large, flat, cylindrical
rock standing 2 feet high, with a
hole in its center and a bowl-shaped
depression off to one side. When the
plague ran rampant, the townsfolk left
food for the sick in the bowl, while the
sick left coins in the center hole (which
was filled with vinegar to cleanse the
coinage of contamination). Today,
the stone is nothing more than a
moss-covered relic, although
the villain in this adventure
has deadly plans for it.

After the Fight: Bort and Tamli inspect the caravan to make sure everyone is okay. When the wolves charged in, they spooked the horses pulling the wagons. While the teamsters kept them from bolting during the attack, the rear wagon was pulled several feet off the trail into the muck, making it nearly impossible to move. This had no effect on the fight itself, but it does prevent the wagon from moving on. Tamli discovers this problem and calls upon Olf, Ulf, and the PCs to find a solution. To get the wagon moving again, at least two PCs must help, although it will be easier if more assist.

Everyone helping on this task must attempt a
DC 15 Athletics check. As long as two PCs succeed,
the wagon gets moving again without incident. If
fewer than two succeed, the wagon still gets moving,
but any PC that failed is fatigued by the effort. Anyone
that critically fails the check is fatigued as well.

Meanwhile, Bort checks on everyone's health. Olf and Ulf sustained minor injuries which they play up as much more serious, but everyone seems to be alive and well. Bort sees what the PCs accomplished and thanks them profusely. He offers to buy them dinner in town later as a reward and promises to regale them with tales of his adventures.

# ARRIVING IN ETRAN'S FOLLY
After dealing with the wolves and getting the wagon back on track, the caravan is free to continue to Etran's Folly. The journey takes only an hour, and the wagons roll into town a few hours before dusk. All of the wagons head for the Feedmill, the only inn and tavern in the small community.
