characters might not want to take on  
this mission merely out of generosity,  
Noala offers to train them in wilderness  
survival skills and ranged combat techniques if they  
agree to help her (see Noala's Training in the Rules  
and Rewards section on page 56).

Any offer to help her burn the corpses is gladly accepted, but Noala refuses to talk about her hand, saying only that it is an old wound. If pressed, she offers up that maybe it is a tale worth telling, but only after the blight is dealt with. See Noala's entry in the NPCs Around Town appendix on page 53 for more information.

If the PCs have already defeated Hallod, they might
suspect that these blights and the mysterious "V" are
in some way related. Noala knows nothing of Vilree,
but the fact that there is someone working with vile
reagents strikes her as unlikely to be a coincidence.
She suggests that finding the cause of the blight might
help track down the person behind Bort's death.

If the PCs agree, Noala offers to take them to a
nearby blight in the morning, perhaps moving on to a
larger one deeper in the forest if necessary. She tells the
PCs to pack for a lengthy journey, as the largest blight
is located deep in the woods and is hard to reach on
foot. If the PCs have not yet caught Hallod, they may
have to do so before being able to leave town without
provoking Rolth's ire. Noala is willing to wait for the
PCs, but she stresses the urgency of the situation.

# THE BLIGHTED DEN
When the PCs are ready to go exploring with Noala, she arranges to meet them just outside of town at the site of the wolf ambush. Noala arrives at first light.

THE BLIGHTED DEN

Once all have gathered, she explains her general
plan. She will lead the PCs to the nearby blight, which
the PCs will enter and explore. Noala will roam
around the site, setting up snares on common trails
and ensuring that any stray creatures flushed out of
the area are contained. The PCs might question this
plan, but Noala persists, claiming that her wilderness
skills allow her to excel at hunting, not close combat.
Once the area is cleared, she hopes to investigate it
fully to see if there is anything to be learned.

Traveling to the first blight takes about 3 hours on
foot. Mounts do nothing to hasten this pace, as the
trail is little more than a winding game path.

G1. ROTTEN COPSE                        SEVERE 2
The first sign that the PCs are approaching the blight is that the plants in the area are a sickly shade of green with spots of brown. Soon, the forest smells of sweet rot, and the trees look entirely unhealthy, their bark peeling off in sticky black strips. Once they reach this point, read or paraphrase the following to the players.

The presence of rot increases with every step you take, and Noala slows to a stop, turns to look at you, saying,

"This is where those wolves came from, I am sure of it. Somewhere ahead is their den, but I will leave that for you to explore. If you need my help, you will find me out here. I am going to set up snares and make sure nothing gets out of this rotten copse."

From here, the players need only follow the trail into the heart of this small blight. As they travel, the ground softens and squelches underfoot due to the sticky runoff from all the dying plants. Soon after, the trail opens into an area with tall trees but little underbrush. The path continues toward the rotting remains of a truly titanic tree and, under its roots, there appears to be a small cave. Unfortunately, there is danger here, blocking the PCs' path.

**Creatures:** In the center of the clearing is a trio of small, sickly-looking thorn bushes grouped together. If the PCs scrutinize the bushes from a distance of at least 30 feet, they can attempt DC 18 Perception checks to notice that there appears to be a wolf carcass on the ground between them, and the plants have wrapped their tendrils around the corpse. If the characters approach to within 20 feet, the bloodlash bushes shake violently and attack.

G2. Foul Den                                            Severe 2
After dealing with the bushes, the characters are free to explore the den underneath the old, rotting tree. Anyone approaching the opening picks up the overpowering smell of wet and rotten fur coming from the hole. Unfortunately, the hole is not quite big enough for the PCs to enter without getting on their hands and knees. Should the PCs climb inside, read or paraphrase the following.

The narrow tunnel is slick with foul-smelling mud. It leads down into a cramped den lit by a shimmering pool of oily water. The chamber stinks of wet fur and sickness. Next to the pool, between the gnarled and dying tree roots, is the rotting carcass of what must have once been a truly gigantic wolf. Nosing around it is a pair of hairless mutant wolves, their bodies deformed by large pustules and tumors. Although they have no eyes, they clearly detect your presence, for they turn their heads at you and snarl.

The glowing pool provides the chamber with dim
light. Without additional light, creatures lacking
darkvision or low-light vision treat all creatures as
concealed. Due to the low ceiling in this chamber,
Medium or larger creatures treat the entire area as
difficult terrain. The roots and moss hanging from
the ceiling make it so that any creature more than
5 feet away is screened from ranged attacks.

**Creatures:** The mutant wolves are the last survivors of the pack that attacked the PCs, living here in the den with the corpse of their mother. They are hairless, eyeless, and their blood is an alchemical soup. They do not respond until two characters are in the room, but then they snarl and attack.

Gore Spray (acid); Trigger A creature critically hits a mutant wolf while adjacent to it. Effect The wound causes gore to spray from a ruptured pustule. The triggering creature takes 3d6 acid damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save). This occurs even if the attack kills the wolf.

Tear ◆ Trigger The wolf dealt damage to a creature with its jaws during the previous action. Effect The wolf tears at the creature's flesh, dealing 1d6+2 slashing damage and 1 persistent acid damage.

**Polluted Pool:** Once the wolves are dealt with, the characters can freely investigate the glowing, oily pool in the center of the den. It is not particularly deep and is fed by a natural spring that wells up from deep below the ground. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting, or a DC 20 Nature or Occult check, recognizes that this water is tainted by something unnatural. A critical success on this check reveals that the chemicals are mutagenic in nature, causing those who drink it to change, often at a terrible price.

The water gives off an acrid smell, and anyone who touches it notices it has an odd, oily texture. Although it is not dangerous to touch once or twice, the water leaves the skin feeling prickly, and prolonged exposure quickly provokes a mild rash. Anyone foolish enough to drink the water must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save against the ingested toxin. A character that fails this save is sickened 1 for 1 hour. A character that critically fails also takes 1d6 acid damage.

**XP Award:** Discovering the polluted pool is an important step toward uncovering what is going on in the forest; award the party 30 XP for its discovery.
