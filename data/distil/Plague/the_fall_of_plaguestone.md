# The Fall of Plaguestone

The town of Etran's Folly has never had it easy.
Located far from popular trade routes, it has
never been more than a stopover point for
merchants making their way from Elidir to Almas.
Worse still, after the Goblinblood Wars, the town
suffered terribly from a plague outbreak that killed
almost half the population. Etran's Folly never truly
recovered. This fact led many to refer to the town as
"Plaguestone"—a reference to a stone marker in town
once used to safely give food to the sick and dying.
Villagers left food at the stone and, in return, the sick
placed coins in a hole in the stone, filling the hole with
vinegar to cleanse the copper and silver of any trace
of the plague. Now, many of the town's homes and
businesses are empty, their residents long dead save
for a few orphans taken in by neighbors or left to fend
for themselves on the fringes of the community.

When the plague came to Etran's Folly, Silwyth Eldara did all she could with herbalism and alchemy to find a cure. Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran's Folly for their treatment of her mother.

Over the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran's Folly; stained by her mother's reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone where they denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran's Folly.

ADVENTURE SUMMARY  
The adventure begins with the PCs traveling to Etran's Folly in the caravan of Bort Bargith, a dwarf merchant who agreed to take them on as passengers. Just outside town, the caravan is attacked by a pack of wolves, the vicious leader of which spews acid. Arriving in town after helping to save the caravan,

the characters are invited to dinner by Bort,
who wishes to reward them for their valor.

While enjoying dinner with the PCs, Bort is
poisoned, dying within moments from a virulent
toxin hidden in his food. The local sheriff, Rolth
Garley, is out of his depth, and insists on holding the
caravan in town until the scheduled arrival of a circuit
judge a month in the future. But the heroes have a
chance to investigate the murder and they explore
the town, talking to everyone who was present for
the poisoning. Eventually, it becomes clear that
Phinick, the goblin kitchen assistant, poisoned the
food. He quickly confesses once apprehended, but
insists he thought he was only putting a special spice
in the food, not poison. Further questioning reveals
that Hallod, the town bully, coerced him.

Hallod's hideout reveals that he is more than he seems. The town bully is in fact an agent of Vilree, who pays him with gold and doses of an addictive mutagen. Defeating Hallod may help the town and clear the names of everyone involved with the merchant's death, but it leads the heroes no closer to Vilree, who ordered the murder. In fact, Hallod hasn't seen Vilree in over a year. The goods and supplies he acquired for her were always delivered to a prearranged drop spot in a hollow stump.

About this time, Noala Kesrir, an elven ranger that patrols the lands around town, contacts the characters. She found the wolves slain earlier by the PCs and noticed the taint affecting the corpses is similar to a number of blighted areas that have appeared in the woods near town. She seeks out the characters, hoping they might help her investigate these blighted areas. This leads them to the Pen, where Vilree had been experimenting on animals and plants. Shutting down this testing ground is dangerous, but in doing so the PCs find a map that leads to Vilree's lair, a place known only as Spite's Cradle. Only one of the landmarks on the map is familiar, though: the hollow stump where Hallod left supplies for Vilree.

Using the map and information from Hallod, the
group can make their way to Spite's Cradle in the hills
nearby. There, they learn of Vilree's plot to infect the
town with a terrifying plague. Worse still, the plague
is already in town—hidden inside the plaguestone—
and she has already sent a servant to trigger the
explosion that will release the disease! After defeating
the alchemist, the heroes must race back to town in
time to save everyone from Vilree's final revenge.
