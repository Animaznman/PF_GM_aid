Bort's death happens so quickly that no one in the Feedmill has a chance to react. After Bort collapses, townsfolk gather round to see what all the commotion is about. A few rounds later, Delma and Rolth make their way to the table to see what is happening. As they witness the PCs trying to help, it's clear the PCs were not responsible, but at first, everyone is just concerned for the dwarf's well-being. Once it's clear he is dead, the tavern goes silent, and everyone begins eyeing one another (and their food).

Rolth's Investigation  
As the town's only real member of law enforcement, Rolth Garley is incompetent. He is the mayor's nephew and rarely does anything other than settle disputes over livestock and break up the occasional drunken brawl. In fact, the town has not had a crime reported in years, so when Bort dies, Rolth realizes he's in over his head.

The sheriff's first inclination is to
cover the body, take everyone at the
table and all the members of the caravan out
to the stables, and talk to each person in
turn about what happened. Although he is
privately hoping someone will give him a clue,
he is honestly just hoping to gain a better idea of
what happened.

Though he can't be certain, hearing that the PCs tried to help the Bort, combined with the fact that they hardly knew him, convinces the sheriff that they are unlikely to be responsible. The members of the caravan who would inherit the lucrative business are high on the list of suspects, but most were not in the bar, and those that were—Olf and Ulf—have solid alibis: they were drinking and gambling with Eallom before and after the fight.

Feel free to modify this interrogation according to
the actions of the players. Rolth grants requests that
are likely to further the investigation, but he will not
start questioning other townsfolk until he has first
interrogated the PCs and other caravan members. He
is not willing to hold everyone in the bar; he's certain
they won't be leaving town anytime soon.

In the meantime, Delma closes the kitchen and
sends most of the other townsfolk home, including
her staff (although Trin and Phinick are already gone).

Upon finishing his questioning, Rolth realizes that there is no clear suspect, and that no member of the caravan can be ruled out. As the town has no jail, he informs everyone he will need to turn this investigation over to a circuit judge who visits the town occasionally to deal with serious legal matters and crimes. Unfortunately, the judge, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, is not due back for another month, so everyone is stuck here until then.

If the PCs protest, Rolth insists that unless he
knows who committed this heinous crime, he is
bound to hold all possible suspects until the judge
arrives. He does add that if the characters assist in
the investigation, it might be resolved sooner.

TRACKING DOWN THE KILLER  
After Rolth orders the caravan to remain in town, everyone heads home. Bort's body is taken down to the cellar to be kept cool, while Tamli and the rest of the caravan gathers to mourn. She invites the characters to join them out near the wagons. This is a somber occasion, and everyone in the company is at a loss. Bort was their leader, and without him, their future is uncertain. Tales of remembrance are told through teary eyes, and rare bottles of elven wine from Kyonin are passed around for all to share.

Tamli remains mostly quiet through this, but speaks
up at the end of the night, just as the sun begins to rise.

"Bort was more than just a merchant, more than just the boss. He was my friend. We won't leave here until we've found out who did this. Rolth's a fool, but I'd be an even greater fool if I thought I could get to the bottom of this. Fixing wagons and moving goods, that's my job. But you," she says, pointing at all of you, "you might be able to figure out who killed Bort and get justice for him." She holds back tears as she says, "For all of us. Will you help uncover who did this?"

Assuming that the characters agree, they can investigate Bort's murder in several ways. They can search the Feedmill for clues, they can go through Bort's ledgers, and they can talk to various witnesses and suspects around town. Each of these approaches is described below. Although there is plenty of time before the circuit judge arrives, Tamli and the other caravan members instill a sense of urgency. No one wants to remain in this town an hour longer than they have to.

Searching the Feedmill  
One of the obvious places to start the investigation is the Feedmill itself. After the events of the previous night, the common room was tidied up a bit, but the kitchen is in complete disarray.

**Dining Room:** There is little to be found here that relates to Bort's death. The poisoned bowl was taken to the kitchen, and there is nothing remarkable about the table or chair where Bort perished.

Kitchen: The kitchen contains the cooking utensils needed to operate the Feedmill—kettles, skillets, knives, a mortar and pestle, roasting spits, a sieve, and a butter churner. Of particular note is the kettle of turnip porridge sitting on the counter, next to Bort's large bowl. Although the remnants are starting to dry out, a PC who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check notices an unusual, faintly floral, smell in the porridge remaining in Bort's bowl. Checking all the herbs in the kitchen doesn't uncover a match, nor is the smell similar to that of ground clove and anise in the mortar and pestle that was used to spice the dishes.

**Cellar:** Down in the cellar, alongside a number of large casks of ale and a few old, dusty bottles of wine, is the body of Bort Bargith. His flesh has turned an odd blue color in death, and anyone checking gets the faintest impression of a floral odor from the body. There is nothing else here to be learned that could not be uncovered when he was dying.

**The Grounds:** There is not much to be gained searching the grounds. There is no sign that anyone

unexpected was present. Searching the yard outside the
barn does reveal one very important clue: a PC who
succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check spots a glint
in the grass just outside the stable doors, leading to a
small glass vial with a simple cork. The vial is empty
but contains traces of a floral-smelling liquid. This is
the vial that Phinick used to season Bort's porridge, and
he dropped it here when he fled during the bar brawl. If
the PCs do not uncover this, Edra finds it two days later
and gives it to them, hoping to assist their investigation.

### BORT'S BOOKS
The players might think to check through Bort's belongings and papers for clues as to why someone might want to murder him. Tamli has the keys to Bort's wagon and will let the PCs inside, but she will not tolerate them ransacking the place. She remains very protective of Bort's memory and reputation.

Inside, Bort's wagon is filled with knickknacks and
keepsakes from his journeys. His belongings are truly
a bewildering assortment of odds and ends, including
a bottle with a tiny skull floating in oil, a taxidermic
dragon whelp, a mummified owlbear paw, a shining
crystal that holds the illusionary image of a mountain
peak inside, and so on. There are a number of minor
magic trinkets in here, but Tamli will not allow the
players to take or examine these at all. The merchant's
ledgers are easily found in a rack above his bed.

The books are large and filled to the brim with details about his travels and transactions over many years. Acquiring any useful information from them takes at least 4 hours and requires a successful DC 18 Decipher Writing check (using Society or a related Lore skill). A PC who succeeds at this check uncovers that Bort visited Etran's Folly at least 22 times in the past decade, and about five years ago the merchant started making deliveries labeled "reagents" to someone referred to only as "H," receiving rather large sums of gold in exchange. These deliveries are numbered, starting with 1 and ending with delivery number 14, which occurred the day the caravan arrived in town. If the PCs fail to decipher the ledger, they can try again until they find what they are looking for. Each attempt takes 4 hours.

**XP Award:** If the PCs uncover the deliveries made to the mysterious "H," award the party 30 XP.

Questioning Amora                Trivial 1
After Bort's death, Amora tells Delma that the kitchen should be closed immediately, just in case it was the food. Proud of her work, the cook insists Bort's death must be foul play because, she explains, simple food poisoning doesn't work that fast and isn't as deadly.

**The Grounds:** There is not much
searching the grounds. There is no sig

Delma agrees, but insists that nothing in the kitchen  
be cleaned or removed, so that investigators can look  
for clues and clear Amora's good name.  
Removing her apron, Amora heads  
home and does not return for as long  
as the investigation continues.
