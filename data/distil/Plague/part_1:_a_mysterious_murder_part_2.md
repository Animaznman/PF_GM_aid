a similar state of disrepair. A number of the houses
clearly look abandoned, their roofs collapsed. If the
characters ask about this, anyone in the caravan can
tell them the community suffered heavily from the
plague 20 years ago and has never fully recovered.

Upon arrival, the
teamsters secure the caravan
for the night while Bort travels
around town to conduct business
with the crafters and families that call
Etran's Folly home. This leaves the PCs to explore the
Feedmill and get to know some of the more colorful
members of the community. This would be a good
time to introduce the NPCs described on page 52;
become familiar with them so that you can represent
the townsfolk if the PCs talk to them.

Notable Meetings  
The first character that the players are likely to meet is Edra Wythe, the stable hand at the Feedmill. She greets them when the caravan arrives and immediately worries about the condition of the horses. Soon after, the PCs meet Delma and the rest of the staff at the Feedmill. Notably, the goblin Phinick is particularly shy around newcomers, even if one of them is also a goblin.

The first time the characters enter the taproom of
the Feedmill, they find it empty of customers save
for Hallod—a gigantic, brutish human man. Phinick
is serving him food and drink, squeaking whenever
Hallod demands another round. PCs that try to talk
to Hallod find he has little to say aside from offering
curt, insulting replies. Shortly thereafter, he finishes his
meal and leaves. If anyone asks the staff about him,
they say that Hallod is a bit of a bully around town,
but it is simple enough to stay out of his way.

Event 1. Bar Brawl                        Moderate 1
In the early evening, Bort returns to the Feedmill and invites the characters to supper. He has reserved a table upon the dais next to Flonk, the town's bard, who is tuning his instrument just as the meal is served.

SETTING UP THE MYSTERY
Bort's poisoning is a mystery central to this adventure, and for everything to go as planned, you should ensure a certain amount of chaos and confusion in the moments leading up to his death. The bar fight, no matter how short, is a distraction that ensures the PCs lose track of the various suspects. It's particularly important who is present and who goes missing during the fight and its aftermath.
  Present for Dinner: Feedmill staff (Amora, Delma, Kolnral, Phinick, Trin), town locals (Farmer Eallom, Flonk the Bard, Sir Lawren, 14 local farmers), caravan members (Bort, Olf, Ulf), the player characters.
    Leaves During the Fight: Delma, Sir Lawren, Phinick, Trin.
    Arrives After the Fight: Rolth Garley, Tamli; Delma returns with Rolth.

The rest of the Feedmill is full of local farmers, as well as a few notable characters.

Kolnral and Trin are serving the guests tonight,
while Delma tends bar and Amora is busy in the
kitchen. Phinick can be seen doing odd jobs all over,
but once dinner begins, he spends most of his time
helping Amora in the kitchen. By the time dinner
starts, Sir Lawren is deep into his cups, leaning back
dangerously in his chair, while Farmer Eallom is busy
gambling and getting drunk with Olf and Ulf.

As the first dishes come out (wild game and roasted turnips with a side of burnt seed cake, coupled with watery turnip ale), Bort is busy asking the PCs where they are from and where they are going, and telling some of his fabulous tales (see the Bort's Tales sidebar on page 54).

**Creature:** Toward the end of the meal, just as a dessert of warm turnip porridge is being served, Kolnral accidentally bumps into Farmer Eallom as he is sitting down with another ale, causing the farmer to spill all over himself. Eallom stands up and starts yelling at poor Kolnral. Seconds later, Eallom begins throwing punches and knocking over tables, and a bar fight erupts in the common area of the tavern. For this encounter, you might want to refresh yourself on the rules for nonlethal attacks on page 453 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*.

During the fight, the entire common area of the Feedmill turns to chaos as a dozen drunken farmers wind up in a gigantic brawl. Treat the entire common room as difficult terrain, as it is filled with patrons, knocked over chairs, and other debris. How the players decide to get involved is up to them. The farmers mostly fight with fists, but the occasional chair or mug is thrown as well. If the characters can pacify at least three drunk farmers, the fight ends.

Several things happen during the fight, which will
be important later. Sir Lawren slips out the front
door while Phinick runs out the back through the
stables. Delma leaves immediately to fetch the sheriff.
Bort, meanwhile, tries to calm things down, but gets
a chair thrown at him for his trouble. Trin gets hit
with a mug in the first moments of the fight and flees
through the stables to find her brother. Meanwhile,
the taproom turns to chaos.

One minute later (10 combat rounds), or as soon as the PCs bring the fight to an end, Delma returns with Rolth Garley, the town's sheriff, who takes all the offending farmers to a table in the corner for a stern talking to (this is about all the offense warrants and, besides, the town has no jail). If anyone was dealt lethal wounds during the fight, they pull through thanks to Delma's skill at Medicine, although the sheriff has strong words for anyone who resorted to such tactics on mostly helpless farm folk. If the characters try to help after the fight is over, Rolth half-heartedly thanks them for their assistance, but dismissively tells them that their help is no longer needed.

A Meal to Die For
After the brawl, Bort invites the characters back to the table to finish their meal and enjoy a round of drinks. Dessert was served before the fight began, and Bort proclaims to all that the turnip porridge here is his favorite, which explains the extra large bowl of it sitting before him. In fact, his bowl is unique in more ways than one—it's also poisoned.

Poisoned Dessert: Just a few minutes into his dessert, Bort begins to cough and choke. Playing this off as a bit of indigestion, he continues whatever tale he was in the middle of telling. A few moments later it is clear, as the coughing returns, that he is in distress. He begins to turn purple and his mouth begins frothing. Seconds after, his eyes roll into his head and a rumble can be heard in his guts. Mere moments thereafter, he collapses onto the table and dies. The characters might attempt to aid him using Medicine. A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Medicine check determines that Bort is not choking on anything, but that his windpipe has swollen shut, indicating that he has been poisoned. Allow an extra Medicine check to use Treat Poison (against the virulent poison's DC of 24) to help Bort attempt his Fortitude save to resist, but the amount put in his porridge is just too great, and even if his throat is somehow opened so he can breathe, he still fails every save against the poison and dies (22 Hit Points, Fortitude Save +6).

Fortunately for the PCs, should any of them
accidentally ingest some of the poison, only trace
amounts remain in the bowl. Treat any trace ingestion
as the poison outlined below, but the maximum
duration is only 1 minute.

Violet Breath (Uncommon Virulent Poison 5) You can't reduce your sickened condition while affected by violet breath. Saving Throw DC 24 Fortitude; Onset 1d3 minutes; Maximum Duration 6 minutes; Stage 1 1d6 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute); Stage 2 2d6 poison damage and you cannot breathe (1 round); Stage 3 3d6 poison damage and you cannot breathe (1 round)
