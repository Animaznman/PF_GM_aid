When the PCs are done in the Blighted Den, they find Noala burning a pair of mangy wolf bodies—stragglers that she caught trying to sneak out of the den after the PCs went in. She is eager to hear what the PCs discovered.

She agrees that the water must be the source of the
pollution, but how the water is being contaminated
is still a mystery. Noala knows of no caves nearby
that contain access to any significant source of water.
Without an obvious lead, Noala suggests they travel
to the oldest, largest blight in these woods. This
will require a one-day journey through unforgiving
wilderness. She suggests they set off at once, but
she will wait until morning if the PCs would rather
return to Etran's Folly to rest.

# THE PEN
Deep in the forest to the north of town is a blight larger
and older than any other. Noala became aware of it
only once the blight had spread. She has monitored
the blight's growth, but she has never fully explored
this area, as it is home to ferocious predators.

What Noala does not know is that this place was Vilree's first home after leaving Etran's Folly all those years ago. It was here that Vilree first experimented with her mother's books and learned the basics of alchemy. Once her experiments outgrew these facilities, she looked for a new home and discovered a cavern complex in the foothills to the east she would later call "Spite's Cradle." Today she uses her old home here, now called the Pen, to test her concoctions on plants, animals and, more recently, humans, leaving much of the work to a small group of orcs that she enslaved three years ago. The brightest among the orcs has even begun experimenting with reagents, calling himself the Sculptor.

Journey to the Pen  
The journey to the Pen is long and challenging. If the group hopes to arrive before nightfall, they must take no exploration tactic other than movement, covering ground as quickly as possible. Even then, they arrive with only an hour of daylight remaining, and they may opt to wait until morning.

When the PCs finally do reach the area, they discover it resembles the blight surrounding the wolf den. The plants on the perimeter are sickly and dying. It is at this point that Noala again departs to patrol the perimeter. Before the PCs venture inside, Noala offers them 2 _lesser healing potions_ and 2 _barkskin potions_. After that, she heads off into the woods to begin her preparations. The PCs can take whatever time they need before pushing onward into the corruption.

This blight is much stranger than the blight the PCs visited before. Here, the corruption manifests in distinct bands. The outer band is much like the area around the wolf den, with rotting trees and dying plants. Deeper in, all the plants have died; they are limp and rotten, and the air stinks with sweet decay. There are no birds or insects here, only the remains of creatures desperate enough to eat the poisonous plants. It takes just over 20 minutes to pass through each of these two bands.

Finally, the PCs enter the third area, where smaller
trees and plants seem to have returned to twisted life.
Their leaves drip with an oily sap, their branches are
gnarled yet strangely pliable, and their bark looks
like scales. Many of these plants are covered in odd
pustules that emit a faintly glowing light, and biting
gnats swarm around them. Swatting these gnats causes
them to burst into tiny flames that do no damage but
emit a terrible smell. Once the PCs reach this area, it
takes 1 hour to locate the heart of the blight, but a
PC who succeeds at a DC 17 Survival check uncovers
faint boot tracks that reduce this time to 30 minutes.

H1. FOREST GUARDIANS

MODERATE 2

The Pen is built into the side of a hill in the middle of a field of twisted, poisonous brambles. There is only one way in, passing through Vilree's plant guardians. When the PCs approach, read or paraphrase the following.

Deeper into this massive blight, the plants take on unnatural shades, and their branches seem to shudder and quake at the sensation of something passing. Up ahead is a wall of thick brambles with some sort of thorny iris in the center.

The thorny iris is the doorway into the Pen itself,  
but before the PCs can reach it, they must pass by a  
number of forest guardians that have been cultivated  
here to keep intruders away.

Creatures: Clustered near the gate are four vine lashers (each indicated on the map with a V), small creeping plants each with one large fibrous tendril that can reach out and grab creatures. These plants wait to attack until the PCs are close, holding them near the poison blooms (see Hazards below) as long as possible.

VINE LASHER (4)                                CREATURE 0
Page 62
Initiative Perception +4; tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet

Hazards: There are three large, colorful plants called poison blooms here (each indicated on the map with an X). If a non-plant creature approaches within 10 feet of any of these poison blooms, all three of them each unleash a cloud of mindfuddle gas that spreads out to a range of 20 feet. The poisonous gas remains in the area for 1 minute, and the poison blooms need 10 minutes to recharge before they can expel this gas again.

Mindfuddle Gas (poison, inhaled); Saving Throw DC 15 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 stupefied 1 (1 round); Stage 2 stupefied 2 (1 round); Stage 3 1d4 mental damage, stupefied 2, and confused (1 round)

**Thorn Iris:** The players are left with one final obstacle before they can enter the Pen: the thorn iris. This doorway, made up of thorny branches winding clockwise in a broad circle, does not have a handle or keyhole. It instead opens when one particular branch in the pattern is twisted. The branch is the only one in the entire iris pattern that winds counter-clockwise, making finding it something of a puzzle. Locating this branch requires a successful DC 18 Nature check or DC 23 Perception check. Characters can get a

+2 circumstance bonus to their checks by using their
hands to move branches aside, but the jagged thorns
on these limbs deal 1 point of damage per attempt.

Alternatively, the players can simply hack down the
door or burn it. The thorn iris has Hardness 5 and
50 Hit Points. Fire damage ignores the door's Hardness.
**XP Award:** If the PCs open the thorn iris without
destroying it, award the party 10 XP.

H2. THE YARD                SEVERE 2

On the other side of the wall of brambles is a yard dominated by three large, wooden cages and a pool of bubbling sludge. A wretched-looking horse stands in one

of the cages, while another cage is filled with a swarm
of gigantic rats covered in white blisters. The third pen
looks empty, but it appears to be built around a small cave
located in the hillside. There is another cave entrance on
the north side, near one of the pens.

This yard is used by the orcs to house some
of their more successful experiments, and while
these creatures are not exactly loyal, they are
quite dangerous when allowed to run free. This is
especially true if the PCs gave the orcs here ample
warning of their approach by destroying the thorn
iris instead of finding a way to open it.

**Creatures:** There are two orcs in this area as well as the caged experiments. If the PCs catch the orcs unaware, one of them is dumping a bucket of sludge into the pool when the PCs open the iris, while the other is in front of the horse's cage (the northernmost cage on the map). When combat starts, the first orc flings his bucket at the nearest PC, a ranged attack with a +4 bonus that deals 1d6 acid damage plus 1 persistent acid damage. He then charges up to attack. Meanwhile, the second orc opens the horse's cage.

If the PCs alert the orcs to their approach, both are positioned at a cage door—one at the door with the horse, the other perched atop the cage with the rats. The moment the door is breached, the orcs open their respective cages, making this an especially deadly battle.

Opening a cage requires 2 actions (one to unlock the cage, and a second to open the door).
