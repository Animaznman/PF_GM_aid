# Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair

Once the PCs have learned the information from the Pen, they likely know that Vilree is the person responsible for not only ordering Bort's poisoning, but also for the blights near Etran's Folly and the mutated monsters that have spawned there. The PCs must find Vilree's lair in the wilderness and bring her to justice.

# SPITE'S CRADLE
Some twenty miles west of Etran's Folly are the foothills at the edge of the Five Kings Mountains. A few years ago, it was here that Vilree found a small war band of orcs living in a complex cave system situated in a narrow limestone valley left behind when a creek dried up long ago. In the depths of these caves, Vilree found crystals and other reagents that would prove invaluable to her research. She used her alchemy to enslave the orcs, killing their chief and installing a more suitable replacement.

In the years that followed, she turned the caves
into a small fortress where she could practice her
alchemy and plan the ruin of Etran's Folly. She
named the fortress Spite's Cradle, as it was here
that she would nurture her hatred for the people

who caused the death of her mother, treated her as
an outcast, and left her to die.
   Now, on the eve of her revenge, the PCs have
discovered her lair.

The inside of Vilree's fortress (areas **15â€“117**) is lit
by sputtering torches. The walls are stone and the
ceilings are about 9 feet high. The orc lair (areas **13**
and **14**) is not lit, and neither are the natural caves
down in the depths (areas **118** and **119**). Vilree's
innermost sanctum (area **120**) is lit by the glowing
crystal formations that line the cave walls.

11. The Gate  
Using the map to the drop point from Hallod's Hideout and the directions from the Pen, the PCs can easily find Spite's Cradle. On foot, it takes 7 or 8 hours to reach the place, although if the PCs manage to borrow or buy some horses, they can reduce that time to about 5 hours.

The directions from the orc laboratory lead to the foothills far west of Etran's Folly. Here, nestled in the shadow of the Five Kings Mountains, there are countless small valleys and crevasses, but the directions lead to one particular valley: a place called "Spite's Cradle."

Up ahead, a wooden palisade spans the valley; a gigantic double door set into its center. Beyond this wall, a guard tower is barely visible, although it's difficult to tell whether it is occupied.

The PCs can get past the palisade walls in a variety
of ways, but if the orcs spot them and sound an alarm,
things will get much more difficult inside. The wooden
palisade walls are 15 feet high, and the tops are carved
to points. It's easy to get a grappling hook onto these
walls, but the guards will quickly spot that. The gate
is barred from the inside using three heavy wooden
beams, each of which can be moved with a successful
DC 15 Athletics check. The cliffs that make up the
sides of the valley are steep and 30 feet high, but
not impossible to scale. Climbing the limestone face
requires at least two successful DC 18 Athletics checks
(one to climb up and another to climb down) and a
successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to move across the
crumbling stone without causing a cascade of debris
the guards are likely to notice.

The guards in the tower do not have a particularly
good view outside the wall, giving the player characters
an easy approach, but their view of the ground between
the wooden palisades is favorable. The guards generally
look around once every few minutes, and they only
attempt Perception checks against disturbances in the
yard (like a grappling hook or the sudden appearance of
falling rocks). They know they are in a remote location
and don't expect invasion. PCs that approach from
above have to beat Graytusk's Perception DC 19 to
approach unnoticed. See area I6 for more information
on what happens if the guards raise the alarm.

12. GUARDED YARD                        TRIVIAL/LOW 3
Beyond the palisade is a well-trodden yard. A small wooden hut is built against the southern rock wall, facing a squat stone fortress. A guard tower stands at the north end of the edifice while a two-story dome anchors the south. The fortress has a brooding look about it, with narrow windows set between heavy pillars of rock.

This area is home to the orcs that serve Vilree.

  Creatures: During the day there are usually two orcs out in the yard relaxing or preparing a meal. This number rises to four at night, when the orcs are most active. In any case, they are not expecting a fight.

If the alarm has been raised, nine of the 10
orcs are here, including Lord Nar but excluding
Graytusk, who remains in the guard tower. All nine
have their weapons drawn and are ready for battle,

expecting intruders to come from the  
gates unless the scouts from area 16 told  
them otherwise.

13. LORD NAR'S THRONE                        LOW 3
A crude leather tarp covers the entrance to this simple wooden hut built against the side of the valley. When the PCs enter, read or paraphrase the following.

In the center of this wooden hut is a massive stone throne. Crudely carved with howling orc faces, the chair is clearly intended to intimidate. Flanking it on the walls of the hut are two massive leather canvases featuring simplistic paintings. On the left is an image of a mountain peak with an orc head howling up at it from a great cavern at the mountain's heart. On the right is the image of a tall, slender woman with black hair. Her ears suggest she is elven or half-elven. In one hand, she holds a large beaker overflowing with green liquid; in the other, she holds naked fire. At the back wall, you can make out a curtain partly concealing an opening into the cliff face.

This hut and the caves behind it are the lair of the
orcs serving under Vilree's command; their leader is
Lord Nar, a large, brutish orc. If the alarm has not
