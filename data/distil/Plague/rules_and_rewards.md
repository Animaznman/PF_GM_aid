# Rules and Rewards

RULES AND REWARDS
Throughout this adventure, there are a variety of new monsters, feats, and treasures that the characters might encounter or acquire during their quest to save Etran's Folly. These rules and rewards are grouped based on their locations in the adventure, with the exception of monsters, which are all grouped together.

Vilree's Alchemical Creations  
Vilree has invented a number of alchemical items that the PCs might find. In addition to alchemical items from the Core Rulebook, the PCs are sure to encounter the following.

ALCHEMICAL CROSSBOW

UNCOMMON   ALCHEMICAL

This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an *acid flask, alchemist's fire, bottled lightning, frost vial,* or *thunderstone*). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb's damage type in addition to the crossbow's normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb's energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp.

ENERGY MUTAGEN                                            ITEM 1+

When created, this mutagen is attuned to your choice of one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

Noala's Training  
After the PCs assist Noala in finding the source of the blight and investigating the Pen, she agrees to teach them some of her special woodland survival techniques. Her knowledge can be disseminated in several of the following ways.

**Ranger Archetype:** Noala can assist any character that is looking into selecting the ranger multiclass archetype. Furthermore, if a character has the ranger archetype, Noala's Wilderness Spotter feat counts as a ranger archetype feat for that character (if the character selects the feat multiple times, it is a ranger archetype feat only the first time).

Retraining: Noala can serve as a teacher who can retrain ranger feats and skill feats as long as the new skill feat is linked to Nature or Survival. As long as the feat being trained is level 5 or lower, Noala reduces the training time to the minimum allowed.

**Special Feats:** Noala can teach the characters a special ranger feat as well as a special skill feat that can be taken by anyone trained in Survival. Note that Noala's training does not grant characters these feats, but merely unlocks them for later selection. This training takes about 2 days per feat but can take place at the same time as any retraining performed with Noala.

RELENTLESS STALKER ðŸ—˜                                    FEAT 2

UNCOMMON      MOVE      RANGER
Trigger An adjacent creature you are hunting attempts to move away from you using an action that has the move trait.
Your hunted prey cannot escape your relentless pursuit. Stride up to your Speed in tandem with the triggering creature, remaining adjacent to the foe throughout its movement until it stops moving or you run out of movement. You can ignore difficult terrain during this movement unless the difficult terrain is caused by a magical effect.

WILDERNESS SPOTTER FEAT 2

UNCOMMON   GENERAL   SKILL
Prerequisite Expert in Survival
Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren't tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain.

Fiery Leopard  
Through their actions at the Pen, the PCs might have befriended the fiery leopard found in area H3.

Once released, the leopard bolts from the Pen, but, at the GM's discretion, it might appear again to help with the fight against the alchemical dredge at the very end of this adventure.

After this point, the leopard continues to shadow the group and anyone with Nature can slowly attempt to befriend the wild beast. This process should take at least 10 downtime days, during which time the character attempting to befriend the leopard must succeed on at least three DC 18 Nature checks. No more than one check may be attempted per day. If the character fails to succeed at three Nature checks within this time, the leopard loses interest and wanders off.

If successful, and if the character has the ability to take on an animal companion, then that character gains the fiery leopard as an animal companion at the end of the 10 days. Treat the fiery leopard as a cat (see page 215 of the Core Rulebook) with the following modifications. If no one takes the fiery leopard as an animal companion, it will never truly be part of the group, but it may still follow them on adventures and help out at random times, subject to the GM's discretion.

FIERY LEOPARD

UNIQUE

Base Animal Companion Cat  
Immunities fire; Weaknesses cold 5  
Flaming Attacks (fire) The fiery leopard's natural attacks deal 1 fire damage (in addition to the bonus damage dealt to flat-footed targets). This damage increases to 1d4 when the fiery leopard becomes a nimble or savage animal companion.

**Fiery Pelt** (fire) Creatures that start their turn grappled by the fiery leopard take 1d4 fire damage. Anyone attempting to grapple the fiery leopard takes 1d4 fire damage for each attempt.

**Burning Glow** The fiery leopard sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius which gives it a -2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks made at night or in a dark environment.

BORT'S INHERITANCE  
Being a well-groomed merchant with a penchant for finery, Bort is fond of jewelry, particularly rings. He has a number of fine magical rings in his collection that he keeps among the rest of his possessions in his wagon when he's not wearing them. Bort has collected these rings from his travels, and aside from being valuable magic items in their own right, Bort has an associated story and memory from each of them.

Tamli is incredibly grateful to the characters
for helping to solve Bort's death and bringing the
villains responsible to justice. After the
merchant is laid to rest, she approaches
the PCs to give them one of his rings as
a token to remember the kindly dwarf.
Tamli shows the PCs the following rings
and provides information about each,
before allowing each PC to choose one.
