# Etran's Folly Gazetteer

used to be sheep pastures. The path
leads from the north side of town, out
through the fields, to the old shrine,
and back around to the south side
of town, passing by Etran's Hill.
**Etran's Hill:** To the southeast
of town is a small hill covered in
old stones and bits of burned debris.
This site was once the home of the
town's founder, Etran Bolmere, and
his family. They moved to this area
from Taldor, hoping to found a small
community as a stopover for the
overland travel through the region.
Rumor has it he built up on the hill
so that all would see it, despite it
being far away from the nearest
source of fresh water. Just 5
years after founding the town,
the house burned down, killing
Etran and his family, while also giving
the town its current name (it was originally
called Etranton).

This section of this book includes useful tools for running "The Fall of Plaguestone." In the following pages you'll find a gazetteer of the town, including brief descriptions of the town's significant inhabitants. There is also a quick review of the NPC caravan members, new character backgrounds tied to this adventure, rules and rewards found only here, a selection of side quests that link with the new backgrounds, and a few new monsters.

ETRAN'S FOLLY GAZETTEER  
Etran's Folly is a tiny community of about 300 people, but many of them live on farms or in small homes on the outskirts. It once sported a population nearly double that number, but a plague wiped out a number of families 20 years ago and the community has never fully recovered. Aside from the Feedmill and the ruins up on Etran's Hill, the buildings in town are of typical wattle-and-daub construction, with thick thatch roofs.

LOCATIONS AROUND ETRAN'S FOLLY  
What follows are some of the major sites in the small town.

**Dead Homes:** The homes on the north side of Etran's Folly are mostly empty these days, and most are in a state of severe disrepair. When the plague hit the town a little less than 20 years ago, this neighborhood saw many casualties and as a result, almost no one lives here today. Those who do call this part of town home are either desperate or are squatters with no official claim to the property.

**Dead Willow:** On the northwest edge of town, near the river, stands an old dead willow tree in front of a dilapidated home. Though not unlike other nearby homes with overgrown plants and poorly maintained structures, this one is significant because it is the home of Hallod, the town bully and servant of Vilree. This home and the dungeon beneath it are both fully described in the Hallod's Hideout portion of the adventure, starting on page 15.

**Drunk Shepherd's Path:** Wandering through the outskirts of town, the Drunk Shepherd's Path is little more than a meandering foot trail that leads through the nearby turnip farms, many of which

Feedmill: Located in the center of town, the Feedmill is the town's only inn, tavern, and general store, all crammed into one overcrowded business. Since it happens to be the only place in town with rooms to rent (albeit in the loft above the stables), it is the place where Bort and his caravan stay every time they visit. While the accommodations are far from great, the old straw mattresses are still better than sleeping on the hard earth outside. The food here is passing at best, with much of it focused on the town's primary crop: turnips. A typical meal here consists of roasted wild game, turnip stew, a slice of dry seedcake, and a sweet turnip porridge for desert. Few desire seconds.

The Feedmill is owned by Targen Fulst, the aging
mayor of the town who opened the business over
50 years ago. Targen is far too old and senile to take
part in the day-to-day activities, instead leaving
those to his daughter, Delma Fulst, who also tends
the bar and the till for the general store. The other
employees are Amora Kasillan (cook), Edra Wythe
(stablehand), Kolnral Brannak (server), Phinick
Padley (helper), and Trin Sathern (server).

Most common items (level 1) can be found in the
general store, but unless they're items that might be
useful to a farming community, the store has only
one or two in stock. The only magic items they
have on hand are three *minor healing potions* and
a *potency crystal*. No alchemical items are in stock,
and if anyone asks Delma, she simply replies that the
