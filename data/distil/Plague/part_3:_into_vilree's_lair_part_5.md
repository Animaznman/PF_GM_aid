The statue standing over the pool is of Vilree; she
stands in the same pose as her mother in area 112,
only she does not have tears streaming down her
cheeks. Instead, her expression is hard, cold, and
calculating. The stairs to the east descend to area 115.

Creatures: Vilree long ago realized that she couldn't trust anyone with her most delicate work. Orcs might be good for testing mutagens and holding prisoners, but they lack the common sense and caution necessary to work in a laboratory. To this end, she experimented to create larger, smarter, and more capable alchemical servants. After a year of research, the first alchemical drudge was created. Appearing like large, wingless homonculi, four such creatures occupy this laboratory, overseeing basic tasks like tending an ongoing experiment or keeping the place tidy. They have strict orders to attack anyone who enters unaccompanied by Vilree. Each is loaded with a different bomb type for its alchemical strike, dealing acid, cold, fire, and electricity respectively.

ALCHEMICAL DRUDGES (4)                CREATURE 2

Perception +6; darkvision
Languages Common (can't speak), empathy link
Skills Athletics +8, Crafting +8, Stealth +7
Str +2, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +2, Wis +0, Cha –2
Empathy Link (arcane, divination, mental) An alchemical drudge can't speak, but its mind is linked to its creator. It can share basic emotional information with its creator, such as fear, happiness, or anger. If the drudge is destroyed, its master automatically knows this. The range of this link is 1,500 feet.

AC 18; Fort +7, Ref +10, Will +6  
HP 30; Immunities acid, bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious

Speed 20 feet, climb 10 feet  
Melee ![inline micro-figure: black diamond] fist +10 (finesse), Damage 1d8+2 bludgeoning plus alchemical strike

**Alchemical Strike** An alchemical drudge contains a special reservoir that can be loaded with the contents of one alchemical bomb that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, allowing the drudge to imbue its fist attacks with this damage. Each hit deals

1d6 points of damage of the same type as
that of the bomb loaded into it. Each bomb
has enough fluid in it for 10 successful strikes.
Vomit Alchemy  An alchemical drudge can
vomit forth a pool of caustic alchemical
reagents, filling the ground in one square
adjacent to the drudge. Creatures in that square when
the pool is created take 2d6 acid damage (DC 17 basic
Reflex save). Any creature that ends its turn in a
square containing a pool takes 2d6 acid damage. The
pool remains for 1 minute before becoming inert.

**Rewards:** The central table contains common alchemical items ready to be shipped. Chief among them is a small crate containing 6 vials of lesser alchemist's fire and another with 4 lesser acid flasks. There is also a small, velvet-lined box containing a single dose of lesser stone body mutagen (page 56). A note on the table indicates these items are intended for an address in the Chelish capital of Egorian.

15. Gallery

The spiral stairs from the laboratory descend fifty feet before ending in a narrow hallway. To one side, more stairs descend further to an iron door, while the hallway continues south to a simple wooden door. Along the wall is a carving of a small farming village surrounded by an immense graveyard.

The stairs descend to Vilree's holding pen (area 116), where she brings prisoners and test subjects for delicate experiments. The door to the pen is barred from this side. The door to the south leads to Vilree's primary laboratory (area 117), where all of her new formulas were invented.

I16. PRISON PIT                                            Low 3

Screeching open on rusted hinges, the door opens to a room that is quite large, with a ceiling twenty feet above. The north side of the room is divided into three cells by iron bars. To the south is a high platform overlooking the cells. Two of the cells are empty, while the third contains a pitiful mass, huddled in the corner even though its cell door is open.

This chamber is used by Vilree to hold subjects for her experiments. The platform is for observing prisoners from above, and it connects to area 117 via a passageway. The cells contain piles of sweat-soaked straw, scraps of fur, a few scales, and other signs that creatures have been held here.

**Creature:** Successful experiments are sent out to be used by other minions, but failures are fused into a horrible, pitiful thing known only as the Amalgam and which functions as the jailor here. Vilree captured the orc war band's shaman as she tried to escape, and then used a powerful mutagenic extract to fuse the poor orc with a hobgoblin. Today, the Amalgam is made up of over a dozen creatures and is recognizable only as a mass of flesh and limbs. In nightmarish pain, the Amalgam's only release is to obey Vilree, who occasionally gives the thing a painkilling elixir.

The Amalgam does not notice the PCs until they
approach its cell, when it flies into a rage against the
intruders, hoping that Vilree will let it rest.

If the PCs get in a loud fight with the elementals in area 117, the Amalgam comes to investigate one round after it hears the disturbance.

THE AMALGAM CREATURE 4

UNIQUE CE LARGE ABERRATION

Perception +11; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet
Languages Common, Elven, Goblin, Orc
Skills Athletics +15, Intimidation +10
Str +5, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +1, Cha +0
AC 20; Fort +12, Ref +10, Will +9; many minds
HP 65
Many Minds The Amalgam has many consciousnesses
  floating inside its mind, and they are not equally affected
  by mental magic. The Amalgam always treats its saving
  throws against mental effects as one degree better.

Speed 20 feet, climb 10 feet, swim 10 feet
Melee fist +14 (agile), Damage 1d6+5 bludgeoning
Melee claw +14, Damage 1d8+5 slashing
Melee jaws +12, Damage 1d10+5 piercing
Melee tail +12, Damage 1d8+5 bludgeoning plus Trip
Too Many Limbs The amalgam can make up to four
  Strikes, one with each of its listed melee attacks, but
  no more than two at any one target. It takes a –2
  penalty to each attack, but the multiple attack
  penalty does not increase until all the attacks
  are made.

Vilree left the room while creating two doses of energy mutagen (page 56). Her formula book is open on the central table next to the bubbling concoction (see Rewards below). This project takes up only a small corner of the large table, which is otherwise empty. The alchemy tools here are all tainted with an oily green residue. By consulting the formula book and inspecting the available ingredients, a PC can attempt a DC 22 Crafting check to identify this residue as a side effect of the viridian vapor. The book describes an absolutely lethal disease contracted by inhaling the vapor. The disease causes a horrific fungus to grow in the lungs within hours, leading to death. The books do not describe a cure.

Clever PCs might compare the ingredients and
reagents that Bort supplied with the formulas in the
book. It takes 10 minutes to find the right information,
but one thing becomes abundantly clear: Vilree had
enough ingredients to create 500 batches of viridian
vapor. Worse, none of those ingredients can be found
here in the laboratory in any quantity, although there
are a number of empty containers.

A parchment tucked inside the formula book bears a simple diagram of a round, flat-topped rock with a depression on top. The diagram depicts a procedure for using acid to create a reservoir inside the stone. There is only one note on the illustration, reading "Mother's ring will be the key." The PCs may not realize it at first, but this diagram depicts the plaguestone in the center of Etran's Folly. Over the past few months, Vilree has hollowed out the stone and secretly filled it with viridian vapor. Her plan is to destroy the stone using her mother's ring, which she has had enchanted to explosively shatter the stone when it comes into contact with the ring.

The tall glass cylinder at the west end of the room contains the remains of a dwarf, Vilree's most recent test subject. To ensure the viridian vapor was suitably lethal, she had her orcs venture deep into the mountains and capture the first humanoid they encountered. The unfortunate dwarf was on his way home from visiting relatives when the orcs set upon him. He died in this chamber a few days later, and his skin split open as the fungus inside him consumed his flesh. Worse still, the vapor is still swirling around his body and his rotting flesh can now transmit the disease. A successful DC 20 Medicine check by a PC who has read Vilree's formula book confirms that these are effects of the viridian vapor.
