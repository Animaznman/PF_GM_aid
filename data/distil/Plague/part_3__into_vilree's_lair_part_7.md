**Alchemical Crossbow** Vilree's crossbow can deliver bolts that are alchemically infused. As an action, she can slot an alchemical bomb into the crossbow, and the next 3 attacks she makes with it deal 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the bomb. These attacks never deal splash damage.

Alchemy Vilree has used her alchemy ability to create 4 moderate acid flasks, 6 moderate alchemist's fire, 2 moderate bottled lightnings, 3 lesser elixirs of life, and 2 lesser tanglefoot bags. These are infusions. She can spend an action to create an additional vial of any one of these items, or any of the items listed as formulas in her book.

**Far Lob** Vilree's bombs have a range increment of 30 feet.  
**Quick Bomber** ![icon: black diamond with white arrow] Vilree can interact to draw a bomb and then make a Strike with it.

Last Threat: Vilree is confident of victory, but if things turn against her she has one final ploy. When she's reduced to fewer than half her total Hit Points, on her next turn, read or paraphrase the following. (This might also be adapted as she lies dying.)

**Reward:** The key she carries opens any lock in Spite's Cradle.

XP Award: Defeating Vilree is a major milestone
for the characters. Reward them 80 XP for
completing this critical part of the story.

Vilree looks at you with contempt. "It doesn't matter, you know. I've already won. I dispatched my minion to destroy the town just before you arrived here. Everyone in Plaguestone will be dead long before you ever get there!"

Vilree sent an alchemical drudge to the town
shortly after the PCs arrived at her laboratory (or
about an hour ago, if the PCs took their time). The
drudge exited the chamber by climbing up and out
through the crevasse in the ceiling that provides light
to this chamber. The drudge is carrying Silwyth's ring,
which has been enchanted so that, if it touches the
plaguestone, rock and ring will both explode, covering
the town in a growing cloud of viridian vapor.

# RACE TO SAVE ETRAN'S FOLLY
By the time the PCs defeat Vilree, her alchemical drudge has a significant head start in the race back to Etran's Folly. The PCs have a choice if they want to save the town: they can attempt to track the drudge, or they can race back to town and wait for it at the plaguestone. If the PCs have horses, they won't have to stop and rest and won't be fatigued for the final confrontation. If the PCs race back to Etran's Folly

on horseback, they will beat the drudge by several  
hours, giving them time to prepare an ambush.

Track the Drudge  
If the PCs decide to track the drudge, they must first attempt a DC 20 Survival check to find its trail. This DC is reduced to 15 if they first locate the spot where the crevasse leading out of area I20 reaches the surface, as this is where the drudge first began its journey. Once the trail is discovered, it is relatively easy to follow. The drudge is relentless in completing its task, and it is not subtle.

During the chase, ask the PCs if they are taking any
breaks to rest or if they are simply pushing on despite
growing fatigue. Note this, as it will matter when it
comes to the final confrontation with the drudge.

Read or paraphrase the following once the PCs are on the drudge's trail.

After finding the trail, it is a simple matter to follow the plodding footsteps of Vilree's minion as it makes its way toward Etran's Folly. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and the unsuspecting town grows ever closer. Vilree's alchemical servant never seems to tire, and there is no sign that it ever stops for food or rest, but it does seem the distance is closing. The trail looks more and more recent.

Just as Etran's Folly comes into view, so does Vilree's drudge. It is close to the town but with haste it is still possible to catch it before it can complete its grim task!

### RACE TO TOWN
If the PCs race the drudge back to town, they have no idea how fast their competition is traveling to the plaguestone. Although the journey is to the same place, the two divergent paths make it hard to guess who might be in the lead. Ask the PCs if they are taking breaks to rest or are simply pushing on despite growing fatigue. Note this for the confrontation with the drudge.

Once the PCs have made their choices, read or paraphrase the following.

There is still a grim possibility that the town of Etran's Folly is now a town filled with the dead and dying. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and finally the unsuspecting village grows ever closer. There is no sign of Vilree's minion, but that only adds to a growing sense of dread.

Etran's Folly comes into view at the crest of a hill.  
The alchemical drudge is now approaching its final destination—the plaguestone—where it will carry out its final gruesome command from Vilree!

of the viridian vapor, a deadly  
disease contracted by inhaling a  
glowing green gas. The disease has the  
following statistics.

Stopping the Drudge                Moderate 3
Once the scene is set, all that remains is to defeat the drudge before it can touch the ring to the plaguestone. If the PCs succeed, they will be hailed as heroes, but should they fail, a miasma will spread over the town, spelling the end of Etran's Folly.

Creature: The alchemical drudge relentlessly carries out its final command. Its starting position and distance to the stone depends upon choices the PCs made. If they didn't stop for breaks, the PCs are all fatigued (unless they have horses, in which case the horses are fatigued instead), but they can square off against the drudge while it is still at the edge of town, 120 feet away from the stone. If the PCs rested, the drudge starts only 60 feet from the stone, near the middle of town.

If the PCs chased the drudge, they are just 30
feet behind it. If they raced to town on foot, they
start at the stone, but the drudge is 30 feet closer
to its destination.

Finally, if the PCs raced back to town on horses,
