North Cage: This cage contains a warhorse that the orcs have been experimenting on for some time now. Despite their ministrations and the creature's half-starved condition, the beast is loyal to them. Its flesh has a stony appearance and its hooves appear to be made of metal. The moment the horse's cage is open, it dashes forward to attack. If for some reason the door is not opened, the horse grows very agitated as the orcs are slain. When the last of them falls, it rears up to shatter the door of its pen and attack.

STONE HORSE        CREATURE 2

UNIQUE   N   LARGE   ANIMAL

Perception +6; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet
Skills Acrobatics +5, Athletics +10

Str +4, Dex +1, Con +5, Int –4, Wis +2, Cha –1
AC 16; Fort +11, Ref +5, Will +8
HP 30; Resistances physical 5 (except bludgeoning)
Speed 30 feet
Melee hoof +10, Damage 1d8+4 bludgeoning
Shattering Hooves The hooves of the stone horse are as hard as iron; if the horse makes a Hoof Strike and gets a critical hit, the target's armor is damaged as well, the attack dealing as much damage to the armor as it dealt to the target (Hardness applies as normal). If the target uses shield block against the stone horse's critical hit with a hoof attack, treat the shield's Hardness as 5 points lower (minimum 0).

**East Cage:** The bars of this cage support sheets of wire mesh to contain the massive rats inside. These rats have been experimented on to make them dangerous weapons that could be unleashed on a town or city.

ICY RATS (2)                                    CREATURE 0

**Icy Death** When an icy rat is slain, its body explodes in a burst of frozen fur and bone, dealing 2d4 cold damage to all adjacent creatures (DC 14 basic Reflex save).

**South Cage:** This cage appears to be empty, but the floor is littered with the bones of previous inhabitants and scraps from the meals that fed them. There is an opening in the back wall of the cage that leads to area **H3**.

Hazard: The large pool of toxic sludge in the center of this area is a hazard to any who draw near. Randomly determine the direction of the wind at the start of the fight by rolling 1d8; a result of 1 indicates the wind is blowing north, a 2 is northeast, and so on, moving clockwise to an 8, which indicates the wind is blowing northwest. The fumes are especially strong in the direction indicated, creating a draft that stretches 20 feet from the pool. Any creature that starts its turn in this draft takes 1d4 acid damage and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (falling into or entering the pool deals an extra 1d4 acid damage in addition to the normal effect).

Each round, check to see if the wind shifts
slightly by rolling 1d8; on a result of 1–2,
the wind shifts one direction clockwise (from
south to southwest, for example), on a result of
3–6 it stays the same, and on a result of 7–8 it
shifts one direction counterclockwise.

Regardless of the wind direction and the acid  
fumes, anyone adjacent to the toxic pool at the start  
of their turn takes 1d4 acid damage.

### H3. The Black Cave
This cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs.

Opening the cage door does not anger the leopard
or cause it to attack. Instead, it waits inside the
cave, in agony from experiments performed upon it
by the orcs. When the PCs enter the cave, read or
paraphrase the following.

Stepping inside the cave, a cloud of smoke hovering around the ceiling becomes visible. Curled up in the back of the cave is a cat that looks to be on fire. It glares at the sight of another creature entering, letting out a weak snarl that fades into a plaintive yowl.

**Creature:** The fiery leopard is in far too much pain to fight the PCs unless they provoke it. Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation. A character trained in Nature can approach the leopard and calm it with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy skill check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check. A critical failure on this check causes it to attack.

FIERY LEOPARD CREATURE 1

Perception +6; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet
Skills Acrobatics +8, Athletics +6, Stealth +8
Str +1, Dex +3, Con +1, Int –4, Wis +1, Cha –2
AC 17; Fort +6, Ref +8, Will +4
HP 20 (currently 17); Immunities fire; Weaknesses cold 5
Speed 30 feet, climb 20 feet
Melee jaws +8 (finesse), Damage 1d8+1 piercing plus 1 fire plus grab
Melee claw +8 (agile, finesse), Damage 1d4+1 slashing plus 1 fire
Fiery Pelt Creatures that start their turn grappled by a fiery leopard take 1d4 fire damage. Anyone attempting to grapple a fiery leopard takes 1d4 fire damage for each attempt.

Although the fiery leopard will not allow itself
to be handled, and anyone attempting to touch it
takes 1 point of fire damage, the PCs can alleviate
the animal's suffering if they can first calm it. Most
obviously, the poor creature is in need of water,
but any it tries to drink is quickly boiled off by the
leopard's intense heat. Chilling the water first with
a ray of frost or similar effect allows the leopard
to hydrate before its fire evaporates the water. A
successful DC 15 Medicine check reveals that the
leopard has also been wounded, probably by the orcs
when they were handling it. Healing the fiery leopard
for 3 Hit Points restores it to full health.

If the PCs hydrate the leopard and heal its wounds,
it perks up noticeably. At this point, it just wants to
escape this place; if the PCs allow it, the leopard
bolts out of the cage, into the yard, up a wall, and
out of the Pen. Alternatively, the PCs might try to
transfer the leopard to a new cage and move it, but
that is difficult even after it has been healed. It does
not fully trust the characters, and touching it still
results in fire damage. The chance of success here is
up to you to decide, but it should at least involve
