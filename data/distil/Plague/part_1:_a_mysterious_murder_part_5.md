she does not know about.

Two days after the murder, unless the PCs
uncover it first, Edra finds the poison vial in
the yard just outside the stable doors (as
noted in Searching the Feedmill on page
10). She gives this to the PCs at her earliest
convenience, hoping it will aid their
investigation.

**Helping the Horses:** After the fight with the wolves, Bort's horses have all become infested with biting fleas. Edra is doing what she can to help them, but she needs an entire bushel of rosemary to brew up enough ointment to treat this many animals.

D. ROSEMARY BUSHES     MODERATE 1
The day after the poisoning, Edra asks the
PCs if they could bring her some rosemary
to help her take care of the horses. She
knows a spot in the woods nearby that
is thick with the plants. Unfortunately, it
is also the home of a rather ferocious old
bear that tends to sleep among the bushes.

Questioning Farmer Eallom
Farmer Eallom can be found in his fields most days and in the taproom of the Feedmill most nights. He is in a foul mood each morning as he recovers from the excess of the past evening. He is less hostile to visitors in the afternoons, but even on the best of days the farmer is not friendly. His farm is on the north side of town and is easily mistaken for being abandoned, as it isn't in good repair.

Eallom's memory of the night of the murder (as with most any night) is a bit hazy. He remembers getting into a fight with "that clumsy fool Kolnral," and he recalls talking to Rolth, but he has little to say about Bort. He was gambling and drinking with Olf and Ulf before and after the fight, and he is still quite bitter about the amount of coin they won from him that night.

## QUESTIONING FLONK
Flonk can be found around town during the afternoon and in the tavern at night. In either case, he is busy performing—badly. The bard has little to offer the characters. Before the brawl, he was both drinking and performing, and any information he offers is likely to conflict with other accounts.

Questioning Kolnral  
Kolnral lives not far from the Feedmill with his wife and newborn daughter. After the poisoning, he can be found at home, recovering from the injuries suffered during the bar brawl. He is happy to talk to the PCs about the night of Bort's poisoning.

Eallom

Kolnral confirms that he served drinks while Trin served the food. He also can confirm that Amora was busy in the kitchen while Phinick assisted around the bar and kitchen. Most of his interactions that night were with Delma, as she prepared drinks for him to serve to thirsty guests. The last thing he clearly recalls is accidentally bumping into Eallom, which caused the farmer to spill his drink and start the brawl. When Kolnral was knocked to the floor, he saw Phinick fleeing the bar, but the rest is a blur. He regained his senses shortly after Bort's death.

Questioning Phinick  
Phinick disappeared during the bar brawl, and

after an entire day missing, Delma and the others
at the Feedmill note his absence as being unusual. If the
PCs ask others why he left during the brawl, they learn
that he frequently flees the tavern during fights because
he is often the target of a thrown mug or, worse still,
someone picks him up and throws him at someone else.

The truth is that Phinick fled from the brawl, but he
soon learned of Bort's death and became afraid that
the spice he was bullied into putting into the porridge
was poison. The goblin fears he's responsible for the
dwarf's murder and is terrified of what the townsfolk
might do to him if they find out. The fact that he
was forced to add the spice, and that he had no idea
what it actually was, does little to ease his concern,
so he spent several days in hiding just trying to figure
out what to do. Finding Phinick is not an easy task.
No one seems to know where the goblin stays, and
searching every building would take a week or more.

Phinick hides in a small shack in the woods and in one of the abandoned homes on the north side of town, and does not come out of hiding until two days have passed, when his food supplies have run low. He has no intention of talking to anyone, and he hopes to sneak back to the Feedmill, get some food, and continue hiding until this whole mess is a distant memory. The PCs run across him as he is making his way between houses on his way to the Feedmill.

Chasing Phinick                Severe 1
Once spotted, Phinick assumes he's being blamed for Bort's death and runs off to avoid the PCs. To keep things simple, the PCs each take turns attempting to pass each location, in order. On a PC's turn, they must attempt one of the listed checks for each location or give up the chase. Each success earns the PC 1 point toward catching Phinick, while a critical success awards 2. If a PC fails a check, they suffer the listed drawback (if any). Either way, the PCs move on to the next location. A PC who accumulates 4 points catches Phinick at that location, and if no PC gains 4 points after attempting checks at all five locations, Phinick escapes. Turns don't correspond to time; a PC with more points reaches new locations before a PC with fewer points, but once the chase is over, the rest of the PCs catch up.

The Market (Location 1): DC 13 Athletics to push past carts, DC 15 Acrobatics to vault around them; Drawback—none.

The Road (Location 2): DC 14 Fortitude save to sprint; Drawback—winded (the PC takes a -1 circumstance penalty to checks at the next location).

The Alley (Location 3): DC 15 Reflex save to avoid
falling in the mud, DC 13 Survival to pick a better
path; Drawback—The PC is sickened 1 for the rest

of the chase, unless they spend a turn to retch.
    Backyard (Location 4): DC 16 Stealth to Sneak past
the dog, DC 18 Nature (trained only) to calm the dog
(no drawback if anyone makes the Nature check);
Drawback—The dog bites the PC, dealing 1d4 damage.

**Turnip Field (Location 5):** DC 16 Reflex save for the PC to keep their feet, DC 13 Society (trained only) to remember a shortcut; Drawback—none.

If the PCs fail to catch Phinick before he crosses the turnip field, he leaps across the stream and disappears into the woods around town and does not resurface for at least a day. This might lead to another chase or an ambush if the PCs are ready for him, at your discretion. If the PCs fail again, Delma apprehends Phinick when he is caught sneaking food from the larder in the Feedmill. In any case, once the unfortunate goblin is captured, the PCs can question him.

Phinick's Tale  
The PCs intimidate Phinick with their sheer presence, and he is terrified of being blamed for Bort's death. As a result, he goes to extremes to ingratiate himself with the PCs once he is caught. Although he does not at first mention Bort or the poisoning, if the PCs question him about it and succeed at a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidation check, his facade completely cracks and he begins blubbering, begging the characters for mercy.

Phinick explains that shortly after Bort arrived in
town, Hallod, the town bully, cornered the goblin.
Hallod gave him a vial of "spices" and told Phinick
that if he did not put them in Bort's food, he would
find himself facing the sharp point of one of Hallod's
many knives. The bully told Phinick that the spices
would only make Bort sick: a little payback for a
bad deal he made with the merchant the last time he
was in town. Not wanting to face a severe beating,
Phinick agreed and slipped the contents of the vial
into Bort's porridge just before the fight broke out.

Shortly thereafter, Phinick fled the bar, only to learn
