Alchemy The Sculptor has used his alchemy ability to create 4 moderate alchemist's fire, 2 lesser elixirs of life, and 4 moderate frost vials. These are infusions. He can spend an action to create an additional vial of any one of those, lesser bottled lightning, or a lesser acid flask.  
Quick Bomber ![inline micro-figure: black diamond] The Sculptor can use Interact to draw a bomb and then Strike with it.

The Sculptor is a canny foe who will stay in the fight so long as it goes his way, but he will attempt to flee when he thinks he's losing. If he unleashes the blood ooze (area **H8**) against the PCs, he stays in the fight as long as his minions take the brunt of the PCs' damage; harrying the PCs with bombs whenever he can. When out of options, he attempts to flee the Pen, leaving through the refuse pit, through the laboratory, past the cages, and out into the wilderness. If he is reduced to half Hit Points or fewer, he does not escape; Noala spots him as he flees and hunts him down. If the Sculptor has more than half his Hit Points remaining, he wounds Noala with alchemist's fire and traps her with a tanglefoot bag to allow his escape. Should this happen, he flees to Vilree and can be found somewhere in Spite's Cradle later on (likely in a laboratory).

**Rewards:** In addition to the gear and items carried by the Sculptor, there are a few other critical things to be discovered in this room. A small stash of coins worth 18 gp and a fine set of silver scales worth 30 gp sit atop the desk.

This room also contains a trove
of valuable information about what
Vilree was hoping to accomplish here.
Most of the texts are written in Orc,
as they are the Sculptor's notes on
the various experiments he has been
asked to perform over the past few
months. Almost all of these involve
evolving permanent mutations in
creatures by exposing them to energy
mutagens (see Rules and Rewards on
page 56 for more information). While
many of these experiments were
ultimately successful, they had an
unintended side effect: the creatures
became far too bestial and unreliable

to use as minions. About 2 months ago, something
changed, and Vilree stopped asking him to perform
experiments without offering an explanation. The
Sculptor took it upon himself to continue the work,
with varied and unpredictable results, and a number
of creatures escaped. One of the most recent notes
says, "The coagulant thing is finally taking shape. It
might not be what she asked for, but she is sure to be
impressed! When it is ready, I will take it to Spite's
Cradle and show it to the mistress myself."

All of this can be uncovered by spending a few
hours going through the Sculptor's notes, although
a broad outline of it can be uncovered in an hour
or so with a successful DC 15 Crafting check. Any
character that examines the notes should be allowed
a DC 18 Perception check to notice an unusual
entry: about 3 years ago, Vilree commanded the orcs
to capture a human. This person was placed in a
covered pit in the woods and exposed to something
that the Sculptor refers to as the viridian vapor. The
last note on this experiment reads, "The human died
in agony in less than a day. We burned his body and
filled in the pit as instructed."

XP Award: After the PCs defeating the Sculptor and examine his notes, award the party 30 XP.

H8. THE TRUE EXPERIMENT        MODERATE 2
From the moment the door to this area is opened, whimpering moans can be heard from the center of the chamber, where a human man is strapped to a large rack. His flesh is missing in places, replaced with large glass and metal cauldrons that seem to be extracting blood from him, mixing that blood with reagents to transform it, then pumping the blood back into the poor man. Around the room, the PCs can see shackles mounted to the wall where previous prisoners must have spent their final moments.

**Creature:** The danger here is a newly created blood ooze that the Sculptor made by extracting the blood from several humanoids and mixing it with a soup of alchemical reagents. The ooze is currently inside the human prisoner, where it is being fed by blood that is drained from the human's body, transformed, then pumped back in. While the Sculptor knows how to keep the ooze docile using a spray of caustic agents he keeps on a table just inside the room, anyone else that approaches the body causes the ooze to burst from its human enclosure and attack, desperately hungry for more blood. If the Sculptor has fled here, he unleashes the blood ooze, using a powdered blood coagulant in his pouch to drive the ooze toward the PCs (he can try three times before running out). To herd

the ooze in this way, the Sculptor must  
succeed at a DC 19 Crafting check, with  
results analogous to the Command an Animal  
task of the Nature skill.

BLOOD OOZE                CREATURE 4

Initiative Perception +8

The victim in this chamber is far too gone to be saved, especially since the blood ooze takes the last of his blood as it departs his body. He was a farmer named Pindro from the outskirts of Etran's Folly.

There is little to be learned in this chamber, with one vital exception: an old set of delivery instructions is pinned to the north wall of the room, placed there to help the orcs find their way back to Vilree's lair in the hills to the west. They have not needed it in some time, but to the PCs it is invaluable, as it includes directions to Spite's Cradle from "Hallod's drop-off stump." Combined with the map to the stump from Hallod's hideout, the PCs now have enough information to track down Vilree, the villain behind everything.

**XP Award:** Completing the Pen is a major accomplishment, and the PCs should be awarded an 80 XP story award for bringing the terrible experiments here to an end.

NOALA'S REQUEST  
After dealing with the creatures in the Pen, the PCs can meet up with Noala outside. She prevented a few corrupted animals from escaping, but she says they were nothing too serious (unless the Sculptor escaped, as noted in area H7). In any event, she is far more interested in learning what happened to the PCs inside the blight.

The PCs' tale greatly disturbs Noala, but she is
relieved to hear the orcs will be conducting no more
experiments in her woods. Unfortunately, Noala
does not believe that this one laboratory could
possibly be responsible for all of the blights she has
located. She suspects that Vilree must be ultimately
responsible, and she implores the PCs to bring the
alchemist to justice "for Bort's sake, if not for the
sake of the woods."

If the PCs ask Noala to accompany them to Spite's Cradle, she is humbled but ultimately declines, citing that her place is in the woods. Until this threat has been removed, keeping the forest safe is a full-time job. She wishes the PCs well and promises to share some of the secrets of the forest with them through training upon their return (see Noala's Training in the Rules and Rewards section on page 56).
