Delma and Targen Fulst, and Flonk, who picked  
up the tale shortly after he arrived (although  
his details might be suspect). Most have some  
recollection of the events concerning Silwyth the  
alchemist and her feud with Father Bolgrist, the  
town priest; if pressed, they remember that Silwyth  
had a daughter named Vilree who survived the  
plague but disappeared a few years after. The most  
likely source of this tale is Targen Fulst, who tells  
part of it when the PCs take him on a tour of the  
town (page 12).

talk him into revealing a few details by using skills
(mostly likely Diplomacy and Intimidation), subject
to your discretion.

In any case, Hallod is not too bright and actually
knows very little about his employer's plans. He
knows her name is Vilree, and that she once lived
in Etran's Folly, but he does not know when or
why she left. He met her about six years ago, when
he chanced upon her in the woods. He found her
roasting beetles from nearby trees and collecting
the ashes, and she invited him to share her fire
and her wine. He was enchanted by her strange
countenanceâ€”she has big eyes and pointed ears,
but not so pointed as an elf's. They met several
times over the next few months, and while Hallod
was smitten, Vilree never returned the affection.
Hoping to prove himself, Hallod began to do small
tasks for her, and she began to use him to smuggle
goods back and forth from Etran's Folly via the
cave network underneath his home. He never
learned where she lived, and as time went on, they
met in person less and less. Vilree is busy, he says;
she has important work to do (not that Hallod
has any idea what that is). He has not seen her in
person for over a year now, and they communicate
only by notes left at their prearranged drop point.
He gets her whatever she asks for; in return, she
pays him and makes sure he has an ample supply
of his additive mutagen.

Hallod has no further role to play in this adventure.
If left in Rolth's custody, he is taken away by the circuit judge in a month's time to serve in a labor mine for the rest of his life.
