is to watch the yard. The orcs attempt Perception
checks against anyone in the yard every few minutes,
increasing to every round if there is a disturbance
(such as falling rocks or a grappling hook thrown
over the wall). If the orcs spot anything, their first
action is to sound an alarm, alerting Nar and the
other orcs that there's trouble. Within a few rounds,
all of the orcs are roused and in the yard. They
remain this way for at least 30 minutes while they
try to figure out what's going on.

In combat, the orc brute descends to area 12 using the stairs on the side of the tower. Graytusk stays here on the rooftop area, raining down arrows upon any intruder she sees. With 40 arrows in her quiver and 100 arrows in the bucket, she'll be able to sustain that routine for quite a while.

17. The Study  
This chamber is a small study. To the north, a staircase ascends to a double door; to the south, a stone door is set into the curved wall of the fortresses' structure.

Opposite the entrance is a bookshelf filled with alchemical lore. Over the years, Vilree has acquired quite the library of esoteric alchemical knowledge. Anyone seeking information on alchemy can spend an hour searching the library to gain a +2 item bonus

that includes all of Vilree's business dealings over
the years, including all of the deals with Bort. While
most of these dealings were ordinary in nature,
she did place orders for large amounts of certain
reagents. In the past year in particular, her orders
got larger and larger, including a number of vile-
sounding reagents such as corpse blood, essence
of bile, and fester root. Anyone who succeeds at a
DC 18 Crafting check can identify these as reagents
used in poisons and diseases.

that was one of Vilree's first experimental
servants. While successful, the experiment
proved too costly and time consuming to be
replicated on a large scale, which led Vilree
to instead focus on subjugating the orcs and
mutating other creatures.

There are a
handful of diaries
here from when Vilree
was young; they detail
the years after her mother,
Silwyth's, death, when she tried
to survive in a town that shunned
her. The diaries end on the five-year
anniversary of Silwyth's death,
when Vilree decided to leave
the town. She mentions that she found
a new place to live and learn about her
mother's work: a series of caves
deep in the forest north of town.

If the characters spend  
any time going through the  
personal belongings, they  
undoubtedly hear a racket  
coming from the kitchen (area  
19); the noise is made by Vilree's  
homunculus as it attempts to cook.

  
Per gy

**Rewards:** Among the curios and mementos on the shelves is a silver locket that contains a small painting of young Vilree. The locket is worth 5 gp. In addition, there is a _hand of the mage_ on one of the shelves, grasping a vial of lesser bravo's brew.

19. KITCHEN

Dirty pots and pans are piled high on the table in the center of this room, obscuring the view of the fireplace that sits beyond. Something in this kitchen is making a terrible racket; it sounds like a wooden spoon clattering against an iron pot.

This kitchen is where Vilree prepares meals, but when she is busy, she allows her homunculus servant to attempt to cook. Unfortunately, the homunculus is a terrible cook, rarely making anything remotely edible. There is not much of value, but the PCs can get food and a wide variety of exotic spices worth a total of 2 gp.

**Creature:** Pergy is a rotund alchemical homunculus
