Roll initiative for the dogs as normal, but they all
lose one action on the first round as they wait for the
grate to fully open before charging in to attack.

GUARD DOGS (4)                                    CREATURE –1  
Pathfinder Bestiary 102  
Initiative Perception +6; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet

Rewards: Anyone searching through the barrels and crates finds them to be empty save for packing straw and scraps of cloth, but a successful DC 16 Perception check while digging through them uncovers 2 vials of lesser alchemist's fire, forgotten underneath a pile of straw. A critical success at this check also reveals a small glass bottle filled with a murky, foul-smelling brown liquid. Identifying this liquid requires a DC 19 Crafting skill check. Success reveals that it is a foul alchemical reagent called corpse blood, used in a variety of alchemical items mostly related to disease, poison, or their antidotes. The box containing this bottle clearly once had 7 other bottles in it, all of which appear to be missing.

F6. HALLOD'S HOME  
This chamber is entered via a short hallway remarkable only for a large steel wheel on the wall; this opens the iron gate in area F5, behind which Hallod keeps his dogs. A viewing slit in the door to area F5 allows one to see into that room. Hallod flees immediately after releasing his guard dogs. He moves quickly through this area, exiting into the caves beyond where there are additional defenses and, more importantly, his stash of juggernaut mutagen. This leaves his living quarters unattended, but searching for clues here will take time.

The home is divided into three areas: the larder, the lavatory, and the living space. The larder is a simple storeroom filled with scraps of old meat, a third of a wheel of cheese, a sack of turnips, and a barrel of weak ale. There is also a crate of empty wine bottles in one corner. They are all of a good Chelish vintage and were probably quite valuable.

The lavatory sits just off the main living space, and
it is little more than an open pit. This is also where
Hallod disposes of his garbage, and there are scraps
of moldy food and bits of junk in the corners of the
room. Anyone who investigates can attempt a DC 15
Perception check to notice that there are a number
of small, identical bottles scattered among the trash.
Examining the bottles reveals they all have a silvery
residue in the bottom that smells strongly of iron
and something else terribly acrid. A successful DC
15 Crafting check reveals this to be remnants of a
juggernaut mutagen. A critical success on this check
uncovers that there is also something sweet-smelling
in the mix. (This is an addictive oil that Vilree started

adding to the elixir a few years back to
ensure that Hallod remained loyal to
her, but the PCs have no way of learning this
information just yet.)

The living area is a mess, with a cot in one
corner and a crude firepit in the other. A simple
chimney leads up from this room before connect-
ing to another in the house above. Bits of trash and a
few pieces of gear can be found with a simple search,
including a whetstone, a dagger, 15 feet of rope, a
hammer, 2 candles, and a coin purse with 2 gp, 8 sp,
and 14 cp. This area connects to the larder, to the
lavatory, to the short hallway leading back to the
kennel, and to an open passageway that leads off
into darkness.

Hazard: The real prize to be found here is a strongbox located underneath the cot. Although it is not hard to find, it is made from stout wood, banded in iron, closed with a simple lock, and trapped. The chest can be opened with three successful DC 20 Thievery skill checks, or with the key that Hallod has in his pocket. In either case, attempting to open the box triggers the trap if it is not disarmed first.

**Rewards:** Inside the chest is a batch of 14 receipts that match the logs from Bort's ledgers (see Bort's Books on page 10), as well as a scrap of parchment that lists each transaction along with a value slightly higher than that listed on the corresponding receipt from Bort. The chest contains some of the gold that Hallod has skimmed from these transactions over the years (the reason for the difference in values). Although Hallod has spent much of the difference, the chest still contains 21 gp and 37 sp. Finally,

the back of the transaction list is a crude map. It
depicts a cave helpfully labeled "HIDEOUT," next to
a shape that might be a pond; from there, a winding
path passes through a strange V-shaped chamber
before ending at what appears to be a clearing with
a tree stump labeled "DROP POINT." This is a map
to the place where Hallod drops off the supplies he
acquires, and where he received payments and drugs
from Vilree.

The passageway leading from this chamber begins
as worked stone, but as it goes further and further, it
becomes more of a natural cavern passage, worked
only here and there to make it more passable. It
connects to area F7.

**XP Award:** If the PCs discover the map in the chest, award the party 30 XP.

F7. Snake Pool

Low 1
Beyond Hallod's living quarters is a system of natural caves. Although the path is far from level, it has been worked to allow for easy travel; stalagmites have been cleared away in some spots and small wooden footbridges have been stretched over pools of stagnant water no more than 5 feet deep. After about 10 minutes of travel, the PCs arrive at a small cave with a larger, more ominous pool of water in the middle. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter this area.

The passageway opens up into a large natural chamber, the center of which is occupied by a pool of brackish water. Stalactites and stalagmites occupy much of the room, but a path between them leads around the pool and to another corridor on the opposite side of the cave.

Creature: The moment the PCs enter the room, a strange blue glow emanates up from the pool, sending a cascade of shimmering light to the ceiling above. Seconds later, the head of a giant blue snake rises from the pool with sparks of electricity dancing between its fangs, while a metal, rattle-tipped tail pokes out of the water behind it, audibly building up a charge with every flick of the rattle.

The giant lightning serpent was a gift from Vilree to Hallod to protect his lair. It is loyal to the brute, but it gives no quarter to the PCs.
