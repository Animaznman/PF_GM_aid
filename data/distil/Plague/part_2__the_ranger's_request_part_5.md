a few skill checks.

If the characters help and release the leopard, they might see it again; if a character has the right feats, they might acquire the unique creature as an animal companion (see the Rules and Rewards section on page 57 for details).

**XP Award:** If the PCs calm the fiery leopard and release it, award the party 30 XP.

H4. FOREST LABORATORY                MODERATE 2

The bright light from outside is replaced by flickering torchlight in a narrow passageway cut deeply into the hillside. Suddenly, the passage opens into a broad natural cavern containing a series of large tables on the far side of the room. A series of alchemical experiments, most bubbling and frothing as they cook, are arranged atop the work spaces.

This chamber is the primary alchemical workshop
for the Pen, and it is where the orcs administer the
concoctions sent to them by Vilree. The Sculptor has
recently begun using the tools and reagents here to
work on experiments of his own; Vilree is unaware
of this.

**Creatures:** There are a pair of orcs here, brothers who assist the Sculptor, watching over the cauldrons and reactions as they slowly simmer and bubble. They are near the workbenches when the PCs enter, but they promptly howl in rage and attack. In addition to using the alchemical weapons they have on them, the orcs favor grabbing random vials off the tables and throwing them at the PCs (see Hazards below).

Ferocity 
Speed 25 feet
Melee orc knuckle dagger +8 (agile, disarm), Damage 1d6+2 piercing
    Melee fist +7 (agile, finesse, nonlethal, unarmed), Damage 1d4+2 bludgeoning

**Ranged** â—† alchemical bomb +9 (range increment 20 feet, splash), **Damage** varies by bomb

**Hazards:** The tables are covered with actively cooking reagents, half-finished alchemical items, and other dangerous equipment. If left unattended for ten minutes, the cooking reagents can start a fire in the laboratory; the orc alchemists also know how to intentionally use this equipment for dangerous ends.

A creature adjacent to a table can grab an item from it as an action and use a second action to throw or otherwise use it. Roll on the Random Alchemy table to determine what was grabbed. If a character first takes the Seek action and succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check, they can roughly identify the items before grabbing one, allowing them to roll twice on the Random Alchemy table and choose the preferred result. The orc alchemists always roll twice, taking whatever result you prefer.

Random Alchemy
<table><caption>Random Alchemy</caption><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-4</td><td>Unfinished concoction (no effect)</td></tr><tr><td>5-9</td><td>Lesser alchemist's fire</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>Lesser acid flask</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>Lesser bottled lightning</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>Lesser frost vial</td></tr><tr><td>16-18</td><td>Lesser tanglefoot bag</td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td>Minor elixir of life</td></tr></tbody></table>

A character can Shove over a table or cauldron, requiring a successful DC 15 Athletics check. This causes everything on the table or in that cauldron to be ruined, posing a risk to anyone who might be hit by an explosive concoction. If a table is pushed over toward a creature, all creatures adjacent to that edge of the table are hit by a number of alchemical experiments, with a DC 18 Reflex saving throw determining the number: a critical success avoids them all, a success indicates the character is hit by one experiment, a failure indicates the character is hit by two, and a character who gets a critical failure is hit by three. Roll each experiment on the Random Alchemy table. Once a table has been knocked over, no one can grab a random experiment from it.

If a cauldron is overturned, roll on the Random
Alchemy table to determine what was in the cauldron,
and any creature in the square the cauldron was
emptied into takes triple the effects of the alchemical
item that was rolled (the effect can't be tripled in the
case of a tanglefoot bag). The character may attempt
a DC 18 basic Reflex save, but this save should be

rolled before the contents of the cauldron
are revealed and, if the cauldron contained
elixir of life, the Hit Points it heals are reduced
by the saving throw.

Rewards: In addition to any gear the PCs might salvage from the alchemists, there are a few other things here they might recover. For each table that was not knocked over, roll twice on the Random Alchemy table. Those items can be taken as long as someone succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check to finish them (roll for each item). There is also 20 gp worth of alchemical reagents here that an alchemist can use to craft additional items.

H5. STORAGE CAVE  
This area is used primarily for storage of alchemical gear and reagents. Anyone can tell that most of the barrels and crates are quite old, but the gear and equipment in the laboratory is of the same style and make and looks as if it may have once been stored here.

In fact, Vilree left all this behind when she
moved to Spite's Cradle years ago. The Sculptor
and his assistants began to experiment with the
gear six months ago and set up the laboratory to
make elixirs, bombs, and other alchemical tools.

The equipment here is old but quite valuable to
the right buyer. If the PCs returned with a wagon,
they could load it all up and sell it. The ultimate
value is up to you, but it should be no more than
about 100 gp, and the PCs would have to travel to
Almas or another large city to find such a wealthy
buyer. Alternatively, they could sell it all to Delma or
Tamli for one quarter its value.

**H6. REFUSE PIT**  
The door from the laboratory into this area is secured with a simple wooden bar on the laboratory side. There is also a secret door leading into the chamber from the lair of the Sculptor (area **H7**). That door is hidden from both sides and can be found only by searching that square and succeeding at a DC 22 Perception check. The cavern is strewn with refuse such as bones and broken equipment.

**Rewards:** Scattered among the bones are a few trinkets, including a low-grade cold iron dagger, a _wolf fang_ talisman, and 8 gp in miscellaneous coins.

H7. LAIR OF THE SCULPTOR                High 2
The northernmost passageway that exits the laboratory ends in a set of stairs that leads up to a massive double door to the west. Made from stout wood and bound with iron, the pair of doors is

crudely decorated with a carving of a small rural
village that has been set ablaze. Anyone examining
the carving can tell it must have been made many
years ago and, despite its poor overall artistry, the
village bears an unmistakable resemblance to Etran's
Folly. The doors are not locked.

This chamber is the lair of the Sculptor, the orc who runs the Pen. When he and the other orcs were asked to hold this place by Vilree several years ago, they initially resented the duty and preferred to stay with the war band. Over time, however, the orcs have come to appreciate their freedom here and enjoy the experiments they are asked to perform. The leader, in particular, became interested in alchemy and took on the nickname "the Sculptor" in the hope he might one day impress Vilree with his talents.

Creature: There is a very good chance the Sculptor heard the fight through the door and knows the PCs are coming. If this is the case, he is standing by the door to area H8 when the PCs enter, prepared to open it the moment they arrive and flee to the blood ooze, hoping to use his final experiment to stop them. In any case, he tries not to fight in this room, using alchemy and whatever minions he has available to slow the PCs down while he escapes.
