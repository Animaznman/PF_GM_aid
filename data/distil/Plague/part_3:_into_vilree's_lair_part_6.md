**Creatures:** Vilree has a number of servants in this chamber. A cinder rat is heating the cauldron; it was bound to Vilree some time ago and it attacks if anyone

disturbs the alchemical setup or takes
anything from the table. Two alchemical
drudges are cleaning the specimen pits on the
south side of the room; they climb out and
attack if discovered. If combat breaks out with
the cinder rat, the drudges join the fight during

Rewards: There are a number of valuable alchemical items in this room. Vilree's gear could easily be plundered to create a set of alchemist's tools, and the reagents present are enough to craft 80 gp worth of alchemical items. There are also a number of finished items here: 3 minor elixirs of life, 2 lesser elixirs of life, 2 lesser alchemist's fire, 4 lesser acid flasks, 2 lesser tanglefoot bags, 2 lesser frost vials, a lesser cognitive mutagen, a lesser stone body mutagen, and a moderate electricity energy mutagen.

But the real treasure here is the formula book on the table. It contains a wide variety of formulas, including all of the items found in this adventure (acid flask, alchemist's fire, bomber's eye elixir, bottled lightning, bravo's brew, cat's eye elixir, elixirs of life, liquid ice, mistform elixir, tanglefoot bags, and of course, the viridian vapor). It also includes formulas for energy and stone body mutagens (page 56).

118. The Descent

The stairs descend into a rough-hewn chamber, the far side of which looks like a natural cave. In the southeast corner, a passageway winds off into darkness. A sputtering torch is mounted next to the door. In the distance, you can hear the sound of rushing water.

The stairs descend into a rough-hewn chamber, the far side of which looks like a natural cave. In the southeast corner, a passageway winds off into darkness. A sputtering torch is mounted next to the door. In the distance, you can hear the sound of rushing water.

These caves are the reason Vilree moved her laboratory here. As the PCs get closer to the cave walls, the character with the highest Perception notices veins of green in the rock. This ore is a key ingredient in the creation of the viridian vapor, and part of the reason it is so deadly. When ground up, the green rock deals serious damage to the lungs, allowing an infection to take hold and grow within hours. If the characters have studied Vilree's formula book, they know this green rock is called flaystone.

119. BAT ROOST                                            LOW 3

The twisting corridor opens into a large cavern filled with large, glistening stalactites and stalagmites. Puddles of brackish water dot the floor, and while the sound of rushing water seems to be close by, the source is not in this room.

This cavern was too cramped for Vilree's use, but a number of paths have been opened through the chamber, allowing characters to easily move through it.

**Creatures:** Vilree is careful not to make too much noise when passing through this chamber, but the PCs have no idea that the room is inhabited by a large number of bats that swarm at the slightest provocation. The swarm tends to move, use Blood Feast, and then move again, while the giant bat picks a target and attacks until slain.

120. THE EMERALD DEPTHS                SEVERE 3

The winding passage ends in a large cavernous chamber. Running through the middle is an underground river rushing from east to west. A narrow bridge crosses the water; it looks slick with moisture and mold. On the far side of the chamber are immense formations of cloudy, green rock, and in front of them is a large black cauldron with a fire burning at its base. Light filters into this chamber from above through a twisting crevasse in the ceiling; the far side of the cavern is lit by glowing green orbs suspended by chains from stalactites.

It was here that Vilree did much of the work to make the viridian vapor, starting with a thick solution of powdered flaystone. And it is here that Vilree waits for intruders. She likely received warning from the alchemical drudges that the PCs were drawing closer, and she is ready for them. When the PCs are all in the room, read or paraphrase the following.

Stepping out from behind the massive cauldron is a thin woman, gently pointed ears rising up from her oily, raven-black hair. She is wearing stitched leathers bearing countless pouches and pockets filled with glass vials. She looks at you with a sneer.

"So, you must be the fools that arrived with Bort. Sorry about your *friend*," she says, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "I couldn't let anyone piece together what had happened here, and he knew too much. I am sure you think you can stop me and save the town. You shouldn't have bothered. They are a wicked, worthless lot and don't deserve compassion. How could they, when they let their own suffer and die in agony? Scorning a child out of spite?" As she says the words, she looks at each of you in turn. "Leave now and never look back. No one need ever know you were here."

It's unlikely the characters will take Vilree up on her offer, but if they leave, she lets them. Assuming they don't, she says only "Pity," which is the command word for her greatest alchemical servant, the Behemoth, to rise up out of the water and hold the bridge between Vilree and the PCs.

**Creatures:** Vilree and the Behemoth should make for a very dangerous encounter. The Behemoth's sole job is to prevent anyone from getting across the bridge, while Vilree remains on the far side, lobbing bombs and firing her alchemical crossbow at the PCs.

Depending on how the fight goes with the
Behemoth, someone could get knocked into the
water. This water flows quickly from east to west

and, should anyone be swept out of the room, they
have almost no chance of surviving (the river enters
another underground cave about a half a mile from
here, and finding a way back to surface is another
adventure entirely). Swimming against the current
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check, but
the DC drops to 16 if the character swims with the
current or swims directly to the nearest edge.

If the PCs take down the Behemoth and engage her in melee, Vilree drinks her moderate acid energy mutagen and draws her blade. She otherwise fights cautiously, using her crossbow and bombs, as well as elixirs of life to heal serious wounds.
