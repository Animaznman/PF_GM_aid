The stairs ascend to a small hall that leads to Vilree's personal chambers. The curved wall of the fortress here is covered in paintings of Vilree's mother, Silwyth, painted by Vilree to remind herself of all that she has lost. The paintings depict an elven woman of unnatural beauty, with raven hair, fully green eyes, and a mischievous smile dancing across her lips.

The door leading into Vilree's chambers is both
trapped and locked. It can be opened with the key
Vilree keeps on her person or with three successful DC
20 Thievery skill checks. Opening the door without
using the key triggers the trap (see Hazard below).

Hazard: Vilree has created a dangerous trap in this area to punish anyone foolish enough to violate her private sanctum. If anyone tries to open the door without first using the key, small compartments open in the ceiling, drenching the room with a freezing alchemical solution.

ICE FALL TRAP                HAZARD 4
MECHANICAL   TRAP
Stealth DC 22 (trained)
Description Compartments in the ceiling are rigged to drop a freezing alchemical liquid into the entire room if the door is opened without using the key.

Disable Thievery DC 20 (trained) on the door allows it to
be opened without springing the trap.

AC 20; Fort +11, Ref +7
Hardness 8; HP 44 (BT 22); Immunities critical hits,
object immunities, precision damage
Ice Fall Trigger The door is attacked or opened without
using the key. Effect A freezing alchemical slurry is
dumped into the room, dealing 4d6 cold damage to
everyone in the area (DC 20 basic Reflex save).

11. Vilree's Chambers

The doors open to reveal a bedchamber with a large bed opposite the door, flanked by a desk and a dresser. The heady scent of lilac hangs heavy in the air, emanating from a cone of incense that is still smoking faintly.

Vilree uses this chamber as her sleeping quarters,  
but she hasn't used it much over the past few weeks.  
It contains her bed, a dresser filled with robes and  
work aprons, a desk filled with personal effects and  
correspondence, and a chest (detailed in Rewards  
below). A door in the corner leads to the privy.

If the PCs spend at least 10 minutes looking
through the correspondence, they find Hallod's
letters confirming the delivery of various shipments
of alchemical reagents. Another piece of parchment
contains a timeline of dates and notable occurrences;
near the bottom, it shows the date that Bort's caravan
arrived in town with the note "Tied up loose end:
merchant." There are two entries beneath that line:
one is dated yesterday, and reads, "The last reaction is
in place." The final entry does not have a date listed—
that spot is blank—but it reads, "Mother avenged."

**Rewards:** While the clothes in the dresser are of good make, they are not particularly valuable. One of the drawers contains a mistform elixir and two lesser elixirs of life. The chest in the corner is closed but not locked. Inside are three sacks containing a large amount of coin (53 gp, 86 sp, 416 cp) Vilree earned selling alchemical elixirs to merchants over the years. There are also four moderate alchemist's fire, two lesser tanglefoot bags, and a moderate fire energy mutagen (page 56).

112. SILWYTH'S SHRINE                MODERATE 3

Standing at one end of this long chamber is a marble statue of an elven woman holding a flask. She is dressed in a flowing gown, and liquid tears streak down her cheeks into a small pool surrounding the statue's base. Other than the faint burbling of water, this chamber is peaceful and still.

Years after building a home here, Vilree hired an
artisan in Almas to sculpt a statue of her mother.
She had it shipped in secret and installed in this
room so Vilree would have a place where she could
go and remember the woman who tried to save the
folk of Etran's Folly, was branded a witch, and cast
out. The statue serves as both a reminder and a
warning: never count on others for aid.

At the bottom of the pool is a sealed stone box that
bears the alchemical symbol for life alongside Silwyth's
name. The box contains her remains, which Vilree
brought here shortly after the shrine was completed.

**Creatures:** The pool and fountain in this room are powered by a pair of brine sharks that Vilree bound years ago. These elementals live in the pool and come out only if someone other than Vilree tries to approach the statue, whereupon the pool suddenly surges onto the ground as the elementals take form and attack.

113. Storage  
This chamber is piled high with boxes, barrels, and crates. While most are partially empty, they do contain a wide variety of alchemical tools, reagents, and supplies that could be used to create a vast array of alchemical items. If the PCs could find a way to transport all of this, the reagents alone would allow for the creation of 50 gp worth of alchemical items.

I14. MAIN LABORATORY                              SEVERE 3

The doors open into a long chamber packed full of alchemical gear and experiments. Cauldrons stand next to tables where even now volatile mixtures are brewing and bubbling. A large furnace is opposite the door, just behind a long pool of water with a statue of a woman standing at its head. To the east, a passageway reveals a set of descending spiral stairs.

This is the laboratory where Vilree does most of the
work that funds her nefarious plans. It is here that
she makes all sorts of elixirs, tools, and bombs to be
sold in Andoran, Cheliax, Isger, and beyond. After
all, her ambitions far outpace those of an ordinary
practitioner of alchemy. Vilree plans to make a name
for herself, to create the legend that her mother never
had—and legends cost gold.

The tables to the north and south are covered in alchemical equipment. The creatures working here were in the middle of making flasks of acid when the

PCs arrive, but the flasks are still carefully filtering
reagents and are far from ready. The furnace is lit
and is being used to melt copper, burning away
impurities for a future experiment. Finally, the pool
is used as a fresh water supply and is drawn from
a well upstream from the spot where Vilree dumps
waste into the depths.
