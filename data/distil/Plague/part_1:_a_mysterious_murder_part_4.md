armed with a smoke can to pacify any
bees that remain. She invites the PCs to
her home, offering up remedies for any
stings they might have suffered. She
also serves delicious biscuits with
honey harvested from the beehive.

When talk turns to Bort's murder,
Amora says that she prepared the
dessert, Phinick plated it and Trin
served it. She doesn't think anyone else
was in the kitchen, even though she went
out more than once to empty the slop
bucket. Amora is terribly worried about her
image, and she seems to care more about
her reputation around town than
about the dead dwarf. If taken
back to the kitchen, she confirms
that nothing there seems out of the

B. THE OLD ORCHARD  
If the characters go looking for Amora, townsfolk can tell them she lives in the Old Orchard, an area just outside town that was once a productive apple orchard. These days, it is foul and rotten, the trees having taken on a sickness. After the trees went bad a few years back, the grove's tender moved with his family to Almas, and Amora lives in the small shack they left behind.

Creatures: Unless care is taken to travel around the outside of the orchard, the PCs are likely to pass near a tree containing a gigantic beehive. The bees do not take well to intruders, and if anyone comes within 30 feet, the bees swarm and attack. Although they can be defeated conventionally, any player who asks can use an action to attempt a DC 12 Nature check; if successful, the PC knows that bees are pacified by smoke. If anyone uses a smokestick or similar item against the bee swarm, the swarm dissipates.

Swarming Stings Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 1d4 piercing damage (DC 16 basic Reflex save). The first time each round a creature fails the save and takes piercing damage, it also suffers the effect of beestings. Whenever the bee swarm uses this ability, the swarm takes 1 damage.

Beestings (poison) The creature must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. Those who fail take 1d4 poison damage and are clumsy 1 for 1 minute.

**Amora Arrives:** Shortly after the bees are defeated, Amora arrives in a head-to-toe suit of padded

Questioning Delma  
As the owner of the Feedmill, Delma knows much about its operations and the staff that work there, but her knowledge of the evening of the poisoning is limited to what she saw in the taproom, which isn't much. She knows where every one of her staff lives, except for Phinick; she knows only that he sleeps in the barn sometimes. She is steadfast in her conviction that no one in her employ had any ill will toward Bort, and the thought of any of them randomly poisoning the dwarf is absurd.

The day after the murder, probably after they have
finished up a day investigating, Delma seeks out the
PCs to talk to them about their bill. She is happy
for them to stay at the Feedmill, but they will have to
pay for room and board. While this is not costly
(only about 5 sp per day), she offers them a greatly
reduced rate of only 2 sp per day if they assist her
with a few chores around the shop and town. In
particular, she would like some help with her aging
father Targen, the mayor of Etran's Folly.

Event 2. Tour of Etran's Folly  
For years now, octogenarian Targen Fulst has been unable to walk for more than a few feet under his own power. His eyesight failing, he spends most of his days in a wooden wheelchair made from a modified pushcart. Delma lives next door and does what she can to care for her father, but with all that's happening at the Feedmill, she would like the

characters to take him on a stroll around tow
give him some fresh air and keep him active.

Assuming the characters agree, Targe takes them to visit the following sites around town, talking to them all the while about the town's history and its people. The path starts at the Feedmill and visits the following locations in order. Targen knows a great deal of common information about these sites (as described on page 51) and any town history surrounding them.

The Feedmill: Targen is proud to talk about the Feedmill, the town's only major business. Targen opened the Feedmill more than 50 years ago, before the Goblinblood Wars. His brother died in that conflict, along with much of Targen's extended family. The town itself avoided the worst of the conflict, which occurred primarily to the west. If there are any goblins in the party, Targen gives them a wary glance.

**Plaguestone:** The path next leads to the plaguestone, which was used to give food and aid to those suffering from the plague. Targen can tell the PCs much about the plague that came to Etran's Folly. He recounts how everyone suspected a local witch named Silwyth of starting the plague (she was actually an alchemist, but Targen has no idea what that is), and after Silwyth caught it herself, she cursed the town's only priest before she died. Soon after, Father Bolgrist contracted the plague and died. Targen tells the PCs that the witch had a daughter named Vilree who stuck around her mother's home for a few years, then probably died or ran off. Targen does not bother to recount the fact that Silwyth tried to stop the plague, or that Father Bolgrist was the first to accuse Silwyth of spreading it.

**Dead Homes:** After visiting the plaguestone, Targen guides the PCs through the north side of town where most of the plague victims lived. Most of their homes are empty and in a terrible state of disrepair. Only the very poor or desperate call this part of town home. Targen notes that anyone with coin lives on the south side of town.

**Drunk Shepherd's Path:** Leaving the north side of town, Targen wants to be walked along this old shepherd's path that wanders through the turnip farms around town. He mentions that they were once sheep pastures, but the last large flock left town years ago.

**Old Shrine:** The path leads to an old shrine  
in the middle of an ancient copse of oak trees.

Targen Fulst

Targen notes as the group wanders through the old woods that while the shrine is currently dedicated to Gozreh, it has served other purposes. He claims that druids used to gather at the shrine long ago. Since Father Bolgrist's death, nobody worships here anymore. Unfortunately, the area is overrun by wilderness, and the shrine is home to a group of hungry bloodseekers (see Creatures in area C below).

Etran's Hill: On the way back home, the path leads past Etran's Hill. Looming to the town's southeast, this hill was the site of the first home built in the area. Targen notes that Etran spent his fortune founding the town, only to die in a fire that consumed him and his family because the house was too far away from the well and the river. This is how Etran's Folly got its name.

**Drunk Shepherd's Path:** Leaving the north side of town, Targen wants to be walked along this old shepherd's path that wanders through the turnip farms around town. He mentions that they were once sheep pastures, but the last large flock left town years ago.
**Old Shrine:** The path leads to an old shrine in the middle of an ancient copse of oak trees.

**Back Home:** The path leads back to the Feedmill. Targen nods off and naps for the last leg of the journey, and upon arriving home, he complains that it took too long and he is late for lunch. Delma thanks the PCs for their help before taking her father inside to get him some food.

XP Award: For escorting Targen safely and learning
more about the town, award the PCs 30 XP.

The old shrine sits along the Drunk Shepherd's Path.

**Creatures:** Four bloodseekers make their home here. The creatures attack as soon as they notice the PCs.

Questioning Edra  
Edra is easy to find, as she lives at the Feedmill and is always around, taking care of the animals and making sure the stables are in good condition. On the night of the poisoning, Edra was busy in the stables with Glunda, tending to Bort's horses; Glunda can confirm this. When the fight broke out, she saw Phinick flee right away, and she saw Trin leave through the stable doors soon after, clutching a wound on her cheek. She was nowhere near the food or the poisoning. Edra knows that Phinick sometimes

sleeps in the barn, but he has other places too that
