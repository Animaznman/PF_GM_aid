they arrive 2 hours before the drudge, but they must
stay alert because they don't know when to expect
the drudge to arrive. They do, however, have the
chance to put up barriers or set an ambush, at your
discretion. At the very least, they start at the stone
and the drudge is 120 feet away, giving them ample
time to stop it.

Once combat has begun, the drudge only fights
back if its path is blocked; otherwise, it moves
toward the stone with all its actions, heedless of
danger. Once adjacent to the stone, it must spend
one action to retrieve the ring and three more to
activate it. If it does, the plaguestone explodes,
killing the drudge instantly and dealing 6d6 slashing
damage to everyone within 30 feet (DC 22 basic
Reflex save). In addition, this explosion spreads the
viridian vapor all around town, infecting everyone
as noted in Hazard below.

**Hazard:** The real danger here is the release

clears the PCs and the members
of Bort's caravan of Bort's
murder. Even Sheriff Rolth is
impressed that the strangers
did so much to help the tiny community. Delma
lets them stay at the Feedmill, free of charge,
for as long as they like, and any tab they might
have acquired is wiped away. The PCs are free to
leave and continue their journey to Almas if they
like, but they will have to wait at least a day if
they want to continue traveling with what is now
Tamli's caravan, as the caravan members want to
give Bort a proper burial. If the PCs decide to train
for a few days with Noala, Tamli and crew are
happy to wait as well, enjoying a little rest before
getting back on the road.

**Rewards:** Tamli invites the PCs to the funeral and gives them all a chance to say a few words, a fond farewell to the caravan master that treated them all amicably. In spite of any shady deals he might have made over the years with questionable characters, he was genuinely kind and fair to his staff and those who rode with him. Tamli sheds more than a few tears as she says goodbye and attempts to make peace with the situation.

After the ceremony, she approaches the PCs to give them a gift. Bort was fond of rings, collecting a variety of them throughout his travels. She wishes to give one ring to each character, and states that many of them are magical. Describe the rings and their powers to the PCs (as noted in Rules and Rewards on pages 57â€“58) and allow them each to choose one.

XP Award: The PCs also get an 80 XP story award  
for saving the town and completing the adventure.
