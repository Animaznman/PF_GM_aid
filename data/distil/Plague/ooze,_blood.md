# Ooze, Blood

OOZE, BLOOD  
Swelling like a bubble about to burst, this oozing thing looks like it is made entirely from blood. Its slick, crimson skin is marred only by spots that look like clots formed on the surface.

Speed 10 feet, climb 10 feet
Melee ![inline icon: melee] pseudopod +15 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d12+8 bludgeoning plus 1d6 persistent bleed

**Siphon Vitality** ![inline micro-figure: two black diamond icons] The blood ooze draws forth blood from nearby creatures, causing their flesh to break open and blood to spill out which replenishes the blood ooze. Each living creature within 15 feet takes 3d6 slashing damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). The blood ooze regains an amount of Hit Points equal to half the damage Siphon Vitality dealt to the single creature that took the most damage.

VARIANTS
Blood oozes are sometimes made from creatures with very different types of blood that can occasional impart other powers and abilities to the resulting blood ooze. Blood oozes made from dragon blood often gain some small amount of energy resistance based on the dragon's type (fire resistance 5 for an ooze crafted from a red dragon, for example). Those made from trolls gain a limited form of regeneration. Finally, a blood ooze made from the blood of fiends might gain a cruel and vindictive intelligence drawn from the thoughts and minds of its parent creatures. Such an ooze might even work with others, tricking lesser creatures into thinking it is some sort of deity or engaging in whatever ruse it can contrive to secure a constant source of fresh blood.

Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws near, leaving the body a husk of its former self.

The process by which such an ooze is created involves draining the blood of at least four Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected blood to a fifth creature, along with deadly reagents designed to prevent the blood from coagulating. During this time, the host slowly dies while the blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6 hours later. Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who created them, but some creators have noted that newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming other members of the host creature's family.

It is not widely known that an existing
blood ooze can reproduce by splitting
itself in half. It undergoes this division
only if it has grown so large that
splitting in half would create a pair of
normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed above.
