# Part 2: The Ranger's Request

This part of the adventure can occur anytime after the PCs arrive in town, but preferably after a few days have passedâ€”perhaps during the investigation into Bort's death. It begins when Noala Kessir, an elven ranger, comes to Etran's Folly looking for the people who killed several wolves just outside of town. She had been tracking the beasts, including their mutated leader, and is relieved to see them put down. She hopes to find those responsible, as they might be hardy enough to help her root out the cause of these corrupted animals. She asks around town until she is directed to the PCs. Once this occurs, read or paraphrase the following.

A woman shrouded in a heavy brown cloak trimmed with leaves marches up to you, pulling a simple wooden sledge behind her. As she approaches, she brings the sledge to one side and uncovers her cargo, a pile of wolf carcasses. She turns to you, and despite having her cloak's hood pulled low, you can make out weathered lips and a slender chin. In a pointed tone, she asks, "Is this your work?"

Noala has been serving these woods for many years,
having retired here after fighting in the Goblinblood wars.

It was a conflict that left her broken, but not defeated.
Hoping to find purpose after all the violence, she found
these people in need and decided to stay. No one in
town has any particular reason to trust her, but she
does not need their trust to keep the folk and the wilds
from abusing one another. The only person who has
any regular dealings with Noala is Delma, who sells her
supplies and reassures her that the community values
her work. Delma has also made it clear that she hopes to
make the ranger's role one that is officially supported by
the town, once her father finally retires.

Noala is suspicious of others, but the aging ranger
recognizes that things have slowly been getting worse
and, as she's nursing an arm injury, the crisis is beyond
her ability to solve alone. She hopes that the PCs will
help her get to the bottom of the blight that has taken
hold of the wilderness around Etran's Folly.

# THE BLIGHT
For the past several years, there has been an ever-growing blight in the region. What started a few years ago with a single group of sickly trees has become a series of seemingly unconnected pockets of dead and dying plants. Worse still, some of the animals

living near these areas have strange mutations and
have turned hostile to travelers and locals alike.
There is no obvious cause. The only common
element is that in each afflicted area,
the blight seems to start in a
grove of very large, old trees.
What Noala does not realize is
that below the surface, the deep
taproots of these older trees
are absorbing groundwater
polluted by alchemical runoff
and discarded reagents from
Vilree's secret lair.

corpses to the flame. She avoids the use of
her right hand, which is entirely covered in an
oddly shaped leather gauntlet.

"These wolves aren't the first, and I am afraid they won't be the last. Worse still,"  
she grunts, as she begins to drag the body of the caustic wolf to the fire, "the forest itself is turning sour. Plants and trees are withering, bearing bitter fruit that sickens and kills those who eat it. If you've been out to the old orchard, you've seen it. The blight is growing, and I need your help to stop it."

Noala's proposition is simple. She  
explains what she knows about the  
blight and asks the PCs to accompany  
her to these dying parts of the woods  
and get to the bottom of it. While the

have a mundane explanation
for what's happening: it's just
a bad summer, or maybe a pig died
in the stream a few months back. Noala
knows it is something more, and while she
has done all she can to keep the people safe and put
down any blighted creatures, she simply cannot solve
this problem on her own. Several months ago, after
cataloging the locations of the largest blights, she went
to Sheriff Rolth with Delma's blessing, hoping that he
might request aid from the local baron. Unfortunately,
the lazy sheriff has no time for "tree problems," and he
pointedly refused to help her or even inform anyone
else of the danger.

Now things are worse than ever, and some of the
blights are showing signs that the plants themselves
are changing, becoming something else.

A SIMPLE TASK
Noala fears that if she does not get to the bottom of
this problem soon, it may spread to the farms and
fields, affecting the town and even spreading further
than this small community. In this desperate hour,
she sees the PCs as her best chance at success.

After introducing herself, she asks if they might
accompany her out into the woods where she can
burn the wolves' bodies and talk in private. If the
PCs would rather discuss things in town, the disposal
of the wolf corpses can wait. Assuming they find a
quiet place to talk, read or paraphrase the following.

The mysterious woman leads you to a clearing in the woods, not far from the town itself, where a small fire is already burning in a carefully kept fire pit. She tosses back her hood to reveal long, elven ears and deep, emerald eyes. With one hand, she begins to drag the wolf
