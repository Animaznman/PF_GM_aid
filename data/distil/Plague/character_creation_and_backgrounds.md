# Character Creation and Backgrounds

CHARACTER CREATION AND BACKGROUNDS
This adventure is designed for 1st-level characters, built using the rules found in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. In addition to the backgrounds presented in that book, the following are additional background options available to PCs at the start of the game to represent their ties to the world and the story that is unfolding in Isger and its neighboring countries. Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign.

Lesser Scion  
You are the youngest child in a noble house (in Cheliax, Isger, or Andoran) and stand to inherit nothing from your family. Although you have a minor title, it affords you no lands or wealth, but it has garnered you a small amount of respect and deference in your travels. When play begins, you are riding in a caravan bound for Almas, where a cousin has promised to allow you to stay with them for a month.

Heraldry Lore skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.

**LOST AND ALONE**  
You were training to become a knight in Lastwall when the Whispering Tyrant escaped his imprisonment and destroyed the nation. It was only by dumb luck that you are alive at all, but the memories of that fateful day haunt your dreams. When play begins, you have boarded a caravan heading toward a new town, having worn out your welcome at the taverns and inns of Elidir.

MISSIONARY  
You received training from clergy in a faraway temple, who sent you out into the world to spread the faith. Although you are relatively new at this, you are always on the lookout for new places in need of your deity's teachings and guidance. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan making your way

GM NOTES: BACKGROUNDS  
Although the characters can be of  
any background, you should encourage the  
players to consider the ones presented in  
this adventure, as characters with these  
backgrounds will find it easier to integrate  
themselves into the story. These backgrounds also  
help contextualize the characters in the events of  
the world around them.  
  GMs should take particular note if any  
of the PCs are interested in selecting the  
teamster background. The group should  
contain no more than one character with this  
background. The adventure assumes that any  
such character just joined the caravan and  
hence has no special knowledge about the  
other teamsters or the town of Etran's Folly.
