# Background Side Quests

BACKGROUND SIDE QUESTS  
Depending on the backgrounds of the player characters, one or more small side quests might occur during this adventure. While all are focused on backgrounds presented in this adventure, most are also suitable for characters with certain backgrounds from the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (noted where relevant in parentheses in the Background entry). These side quests can occur at any point during the adventure.

Finally, the refugee background doesn't have a
specific side quest presented here, but you are free to
add if you wish. Use the side quests presented here as
examples when building your own.

Dereliction and Redemption  
Background: lost and alone (Warrior)  
Sir Lawren Krent is running from far more than just the nightmares he saw during the fall of Lastwall: he is also hiding from a terrible shame. Unfortunately, the result of his cowardice followed him here to Etran's Folly, and it wants revenge. Just after sunset, Sir Lawren approaches the characters with a look of worry and panic on his face. Speaking directly to the character with the appropriate background, read or paraphrase the following.

Krent looks at you with his eyes wide and bloodshot.  
"Talmore, my old friend. You have to help me. I think *his* minions have followed us here. I seen 'em. They're coming!"

Krent is clearly deep into his drink, and in his
altered state, he sees one of the PCs as his former
comrade Talmore. Though he's clearly mistaken,
what is real is his apparent terror that minions of
the Whispering Tyrant have followed him to Etran's
Folly. In truth, Krent is partly correct. Talmore was
a fellow crusader in Lastwall and Krent's close
friend, but when Lastwall fell, Krent left Talmore's
side during a fight to hide from the undead horde.
When it was over, he searched the battlefield only
to find his friend's mangled body. Distraught, Krent
took Talmore's holy symbol and fled. The incident
weighs heavily on poor Krent, and he's been running
ever since. Now, the knight is seeing things, but while
most of his visions are simply manifestations of his
shame and guilt, one is not. The ghost of Talmore is
indeed haunting him.

From this point onward, Krent sees the PC as his
long-lost friend, recounting old tales, apologizing for
the time he left a scar on his face after accidentally
cutting him during sparring practice, and asking
how he managed to escape Lastwall. If the PC

acts confused, Krent merely plays it off  
as a joke and continues treating the PC  
as Talmore. Clever characters might easily  
get Krent to reveal parts of his history by  
pretending to be Talmore. Throughout, Krent  
insists that the enemy is here, begging his friend  
for help in defeating the vile undead agents. If the  
character agrees, Krent says that they are hiding in  
an old ruined farmhouse that Krent occupied when  
he first came to town.

Confronting the Ghost        Moderate 1
The creature that dwells here is the ghost of Talmore, bound to the holy symbol that Krent took from his dead body. If the PCs enter the dilapidated house, read or paraphrase the following.

A sagging straw roof barely protects this abandoned house from the elements. Piles of debris litter the common room, which shows signs of occupation, although not too recently. A backpack sits in one corner with a glint of silver inside its open flap, resting next to a shattered chair and a moldy old blanket. Quite suddenly the air seems to grow cold, and the sound of moaning fills the house.

The ghost of Talmore appears and attacks any who are inside the home (using the statistics of a ghost commoner with the weak adjustment), but he will not pursue them or attack downed foes. He looks like the gaunt form of a soldier whose raiment is quite similar to Sir Lawren's. The ghost appears to have a nasty-looking scar running down one side of his face. If the ghost is defeated, he rematerializes after only a few days to continue haunting the holy symbol of Iomedae. The only way to put him to rest is by giving the holy symbol a proper burial, something the PCs can learn if they know the holy symbol's origin and succeed at a DC 16 Religion check.

The characters can avoid fighting the ghost if they can convince Krent to enter the home and apologize to the ghost of his friend. If he does so, the ghost fades away for the evening, allowing the PCs to bury the holy symbol in peace.

WEAK GHOST COMMONER                CREATURE 3  
Pathfinder Bestiary 6, 167  
Initiative: Perception +8, darkvision

Upon putting the spirit to rest, Sir Lawren Krent
looks like he has been freed from a heavy burden. In
a moment of clarity he profusely thanks the heroes,
especially the PC who he confused for Talmore.

He also offers a few small tokens of his gratitude. To the group he offers two *minor healing potions* and a *potency crystal* talisman. To the PC who he thought was Talmore, he offers his blade, a *+1 longsword*.

Heir to Folly  
Background: Lesser Scion (Noble)  
Mayor Targen Fulst is a very old man, but despite his failing health and spotty memory, he has a knack for remembering bits of history, especially when they relate to his family. When he hears the last name of the character with the appropriate background, he

has a revelation. This PC is a distant relative of both
Targen and the town's founder, Etran Bolmere.
  When Targen hears the name of the PCs, read or
paraphrase the following.

"Well, isn't that peculiar." The aging mayor stares at you intently. "I thought something about you looked familiar. I think we might be kin. Distantly, but I remember my father telling tales of the family history, and your family was mentioned at least once." As he continues, he seems almost disappointed. "Such a shame that the family history went up in flames with the rest of the Bolmere estate."

Targen knows nothing else about the relationship,
stating that any proof would reside in the ruins of
the Bolmere estate, atop Etran's Hill. In any case,
after he lets Delma know that the PC is kin, that PC
receives free room and board at the Feedmill.

The ruins of the Bolmere estate are just south of town. The place is entirely overgrown, but much of the scorched and crumbling stonework can still be seen under a layer of moss and ivy. Thoroughly searching the ruins takes at least an hour. At the end of that time, roll a secret DC 18 Perception check for each character taking a look around. If anyone succeeds, they spot a loose piece of stone masonry in the crumbling chimney set into the estate's north wall.

Reward: Behind the stone is a copper lockbox covered in a green patina. Inside is an old, leather-bound book and a tarnished silver amulet. The book is a piece of the Bolmere family history, listing births and deaths going back several hundred years. Looking through these names does confirm a distant relationship between the PC, the Bolmere family, and Targen and his daughter. There might very well be other revelations in here, but those are left for you to decide based on the character's backstory.

The silver amulet is an old family treasure. While
it bears a faint aura of conjuration, it does not seem
to have any powers, but the word "Karvasalon"
is carved into the back. If someone wearing
the amulet casts a _planar ally_ ritual while
speaking that name, instead of what they
were intending to call, the amulet calls
a mysterious creature cloaked in
shadows. This thing has served
the family for centuries, and
although no one has called it
in many years, it still answers the summons. The
creature refuses to say why, but when asked about
the arrangement, it merely states that it owes "an
eternal debt." The exact statistics and abilities of
Karvasalon are up to you to decide, as is the creature's

true nature, but it should in some way speak to the
character's backstory and history.

Last Delivery  
Background: Teamster  
Bort's death has repercussions for the members of the caravan, including for any PC who works for the caravan, even if they are relatively new to the team. The most pressing challenges are being handled by Tamli and the others, but in going through Bort's ledgers, she discovers that he still has one last delivery to make here in town. This side quest can occur at any time after Bort's death, starting when Tamli comes to find them.

Emerging from the yard, you can see Tamli carrying something long and awkward wrapped in burlap. She catches your eye and makes her way straight to you. "I have a little chore that needs to be seen to. Bort's final delivery is here in town, and it needs to be done delicately."

Tamli unwraps the burlap bundle to reveal a pair of sparring swords that were ordered by Pari Hemsoth, a young woman who lives with her mother on a farm about a mile from town. Bort's records for the delivery included a rather cryptic note that reads, "Make sure the mother doesn't find out." While Tamli does not quite know what this means, she trusts that the PCs will deliver the goods discreetly.

In truth, Pari wants the swords so that she can advance her training. She hopes to leave this town sometime soon, hopefully as an adventurer. This has been her dream since she was little, when her older brother died in the Goblinblood Wars, but the loss of her brother has made her mother paranoid and extremely overprotective of her only remaining child.

Getting out to the Hemsoth farm is not difficult, but approaching it to make the delivery without being spotted by Pari's mother takes a bit of ingenuity. The PCs could simply use Stealth, but making it up to the farm without being seen requires succeeding at at least two consecutive DC 18 Stealth checks. Failure results in Elmora, the mother, storming out and demanding that the "vagrants" get off her farm at once. She does not want any adventurers talking to her daughter. Another option is for the PCs to try distracting the mother with a Bluff, Diplomacy, or even Thievery check, making it much easier for someone else to sneak up. Ultimately, any reasonable plan should have a good chance of success.

Once the PCs have found a way to deliver the
swords, Pari is very grateful. While she is happy
that she can continue her training regardless, she

asks if any of the PCs might be willing
to help her learn how to use a sword. If a
PC agrees, she will happily pay for the service.
This allows a character to spend downtime to
earn gold, using their attack bonus in place of
a Lore or Crafting skill modifier as long as they
are trained in martial weapons.

New Faith  
Background: Missionary (Acolyte)  
The town of Etran's Folly has not had a proper church since Father Bolgrist died of the plague nearly 20 years ago. When the plague hit and the fiery priest of Gozreh blamed Silwyth, calling her a witch, most in town believed him. When the priest himself succumbed to the plague, most considered the matter closed. Since then, the town has been without a priest and his shrine has fallen into ruin, being used as a barn on the edge of town.

If the characters poke around the old church, an
aging dwarven farmer ambles up and asks what they
want with his barn. Introducing himself as Metmon,
he explains that he has been using the old church as
a barn for almost 10 years now, but he doesn't have
too much use for it these days.

If the PC show signs of faith, Metmon says that
they can have the old building if they plan on
bringing "godly ways" back to the town. Metmon is
a worshipper of Abadar, but he will be just as happy
to see the church of any good or lawful neutral
deity established in town. He even offers the help of
his son, Edfur, in cleaning out the place. If the PCs
agree, this can become a downtime activity for one
or more characters.

Clearing out the church and repairing the roof
take at least 20 days to complete, but this can be
reduced to 15 with Edfur's help. During this time, if
one of the PCs helping Edfur is trained in Religion,
the young dwarf becomes very curious about that
PC's faith, asking all sorts of questions and showing
a genuine interest in the PC's beliefs. If the PC
engages with Edfur, he asks what he has to do to
become a priest of the faith. He explains that if he
can learn enough, he hopes to one day become the
town's priest, leading the people of Etran's Folly in
spiritual matters.

How this side quest comes to a conclusion is
really up to the PC. They can spend time with Edfur,
teaching him about the faith, or they can send him
to nearby Elidir for more formal training. The PC
might decide to stay in Etran's Folly for a time,
tending to the locals until Edfur is ready, or they
might even retire from adventuring to live here.
