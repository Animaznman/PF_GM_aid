# NPCs Around Town

town hasn't had "one of them chymist witches" for
almost 20 years.

Old Shrine: The town once offered prayers to a number of deities, with Gozreh chief among them. Most townspeople ventured out to this small shrine dedicated to Gozreh just outside of town, located in a dell brimming natural beauty. After the plague took the town's only priest, much of the community's faith has faded. While most residents still offer up prayers now and then, there are no organized services, and most holy days are observed only in small, personal gatherings.

Today, the old shrine is in the  
process of being reclaimed by the  
wilds. Its standing stones are covered  
with a tangled mass of moss and ivy.  
Worse still, the shrine is now home to a nest  
of four bloodseekers.

**Plaguestone:** At the height of the plague, the healthy kept their distance from the sick, hoping to stave off infection. As heartless as this might seem, the town did come up with a way to offer aid and succor to the quarantined ill. Just west of the Feedmill, a great stone was used to exchange food and remedies for coin, with the aid being placed on one side and the coins dropped into a depression on the other side that was filled with vinegar to decontaminate them. This plaguestone was the only contact that the ill had with others in town and their loved ones.

Today, the stone is covered in moss and ivy, a
silent witness to those grim months. The town
folk pay it no heed, which might prove to be their
downfall, as Vilree's plan to destroy the town uses
this very stone as the implement of her revenge.
Over the past few years, she has slowly hollowed
out the inside of the stone using acid and filled
it with a virulent plague. Anyone inspecting the
stone might notice a crack in the top, but there is
no way for observes to detect the deep reservoir
of alchemical soup that hides within, aside from
destroying the stone.

NPCS AROUND TOWN  
The following NPCs can be found in and around the town of Etran's Folly. Unless otherwise noted, they are 0-level characters with a +5 bonus to skills applicable to their profession. In most cases, they

flee or surrender if faced with violence unless their
lives or the lives of their loved ones are in danger.
Each entry contains a brief description of the
NPC and their general attitude.

Amora Kasillan (LN female human cook): Amora spends most of her days in the Feedmill's kitchen. She's loud and boisterous and can often be heard singing off-key while she works. She is very proud of her cooking, boasting that everything has to be just right, and that she makes the finest meals in Etran's Folly. She does not allow any substitutions.

Amora stands at just under 6 feet tall, with short brown hair kept tied tight behind her head. She is rarely seen without an apron on, even at home. Amora's voice and laughter are as big as she is, and while she is perfectly friendly to guests, she can fly into a fury if anyone criticizes her cooking.

**Delma Fulst (NG female human bartender):**
Daughter of mayor Targen Fulst, Delma rung the Feedmill, the town's only tavern, inn, and general store. Delma has a shrewd eye for business that she learned from her father, but unlike him, she has compassion and empathy for the folks around town. She knows that without the Feedmill, the town would probably fade away, so she does everything in her power to ensure that it is always well stocked and offers up fair prices.

Edra Wythe (NG female halfling stablehand):
Edra works in the stables and barn at the Feedmill. She takes her job seriously—when there actually work to be done. Otherwise she can be found napping in one of the stables, passed out from drinking too much turnip ale.

**Farmer Eallom (CN male human farmer):** Farmer Eallom is the town drunk, and lives in a run-down turnip farm on the edge of town. He spends most nights at the Feedmill getting drunk on turnip ale and a tarry rum-like drink that the locals just call "wagon grease" (also made from turnips).

Flonk the Bard (CG male half-elf musician):
Flonk is the town's only source of musical entertainment, not that he is any good, despite decades of practice. His lute is missing two strings, and the self-proclaimed "bard" knows only about a half-dozen songs. He can be found at the Feedmill every night, singing and strumming away—badly.

Hallod (LE male human bully): Hallod is a large, imposing man, bearing a number of scars
