# Deadly Flora

**TREASURE**
While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims' wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans.

LOCATIONS
These deadly organisms can be found
in any hot or temperate environment,
but like most plants, they need light
and moisture to thrive.

DEADLY FLORA  
What first appears to be a simple shrub suddenly stirs to life.

**Blood Siphon** ![inline micro-figure: two black diamond icons] The tendrils of the bush reach out to siphon the blood from a victim up to 20 feet away with persistent bleed damage, causing the victim to immediately take that amount of bleed damage (basic Reflex DC 17). The bush regains an amount of Hit Points equal to double the damage dealt.

**Spinning Strike** ![inline micro-figure: three black chevrons] The bush spins in a circle, lashing out in all directions at once. It makes one attack roll and compares the result to the AC of each creature within its melee reach, rolling damage only once and applying it to each creature hit.

Weeping Wounds A bloodlash bush's vines cause terrible lacerations that continue to bleed. A creature hit with a vine attack takes 1 persistent bleed damage (2 on a critical hit). Unlike other forms of persistent damage, this damage is cumulative, to a maximum of 5 persistent bleed damage but it can be stopped like any other persistent bleed damage.

**Light Hold** A creature grabbed by a vine lasher is not immobilized, but the grabbed creature's space and every adjacent square use the rules for difficult terrain. If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed creature within 10 feet of itself. If two or more vine lashers have a creature grabbed in this way, then the target's space and adjacent square instead use the rules for greater difficult terrain.

Often overlooked in light of more obvious threats, some plants can be just as deadly and dangerous as wild beasts.
    The bloodlash bush attempts to lacerate its foes, using its weeping wounds to irrigate the ground around itself. The seeds of a bloodlash bush can take root only in soil that has been soaked in blood.
    The vine lasher attacks in groups, attempting to immobilize prey and slowly tear a creature to pieces.
