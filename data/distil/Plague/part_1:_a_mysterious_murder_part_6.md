the next morning that Bort had died from his poisoned
dessert. Terrified, Phinick has been hiding ever since.
He realizes he's involved, but he begs the characters
for mercy, claiming honestly that he had no idea the
vial was filled with deadly poison. If the players bring
Rolth Garley into this, the sheriff takes the goblin into
custody, locking him up in the cellar of his house until
the circuit judge arrives. After hearing the goblin's story,
Rolth says that it would go much easier for Phinick if
Hallod were in custody as well. Rolth is afraid of the
massive man, and refuses to take on the bully himself,
asking the PCs to do it instead. Rolth is firm in his belief
that Phinick should not go unpunished for this crime,

but he also is willing to listen to reason, suggesting the
goblin could earn a lighter sentence if the PCs speak to
the judge on his behalf.

Both Phinick and Rolth know that  
Hallod lives at Dead Willow, one of  
the seemingly abandoned buildings  
on the north side of town. If  
the PCs end up exploring Dead  
Willow, go to the Hallod's Hideout  
section of this adventure.

**XP Award:** When the PCs discover Hallod's involvement in Bort's death, award the party 30 XP.

Questioning Sir Lawren Krent

Sir Lawren Krent can be found most days sleeping in an abandoned home or a drainage ditch. He smells quite bad by morning, but most days, he dumps a bucket of water or two over himself to preserve what shreds of dignity he has left.

Sir Lawren is not much help to the PCs'
investigation. He fled the moment the bar brawl
began, and he was very drunk before it had even
started. The former knight is terrified of conflict, and
he is constantly looking over his shoulder as if he is
being followed. See the side quest section on page 59
for more information on what is haunting Sir Lawren.

**QUESTIONING TRIN**  
Trin works four nights a week at the Feedmill while her brother Marny stays home to work the crops, despite the fact that the soil seems to have turned sour.

E. TRIN'S HOUSE                                    Low 1
Trin and Marny live on a small turnip farm on the southwest side of town. Although the farm has been struggling this year, the siblings get by on their combined income.

**Creature:** When the PCs arrive at the farm, a PC who succeeds at a DC 10 Perception check notices Marny running clockwise around the farmhouse. The PCs have enough time for a single action, such as drawing a weapon or moving. A moment later, a gigantic boar rounds the farmhouse, chasing the poor man. If the PCs jump into action, they can roll initiative as normal. If they stay back, the pig chases Marny for a minute, catches up to him, wounds him terribly, and flees into the woods.

Trin's Testimony: Marny thanks any PCs that fought the boar or tended his wounds. If the PCs defeated the angry beast, the farmer gratefully offers to dress and cook the animal for them. Trin recognizes the group from the Feedmill and invites them inside for tea. A bruise is visible on her face. Until they inform her, Trin has no idea that Bort is dead, having left the bar after being hit in the face with a mug. She is shocked by the news of the merchant's death and gladly helps by relating everything she can remember.

Trin spent the evening serving food while Kolnral served drinks. As a result, she spent most of her night going back and forth between the kitchen and tables. She recalls serving all of the food at the PCs' table, including the turnip porridge right before the fight began. During the struggle, she stood near the table, having just dropped off the desserts, and that's when she was hit with the mug. Her memory after that is a blur until she got home, when her brother took care of her. She does not recall seeing anyone near the food who should not have been; she confirms that Amora prepared it and Phinick plated it.

HALLOD'S HIDEOUT  
Eventually the characters should try to find Hallod at Dead Willow. Located on the north side of town, the building is easy to find—it earned its name from a large dying tree in the front yard—and it's in very poor condition. When the PCs approach, read or paraphrase the following.

A huge, dead willow stands in front of a house that appears to be in serious disrepair. It might have had a second story at one time, but that long ago collapsed into ruin, taking parts of the first floor with it. The windows are all boarded over, and the front door hangs open about a foot, kept from swinging wider by a frayed rope.

The yard is a complete mess of overgrown weeds. The house itself is constructed from thick wooden posts, slats, and plaster. It's barely standing, with the entire second floor having collapsed, filling much of the first floor with debris and dense thatch mats originally

1 SQUARE = 5 FEET

from the roof. There is danger here: Hallod has placed
more than one trap to harm uninvited guests.

Deep beneath the crumbling house is a small
basement area connected to a series of caves that
eventually emerge under the roots of a giant old
tree in the forest outside town. Hallod discovered
this secret exit years ago when he first explored
the house, and he now uses it as a hideout to serve
Vilree's interests in Etran's Folly. He has also used
it to smuggle alchemical reagents out of town, and
to move more sinister cargo in. It is the existence of
these caves that has made Hallod such a valuable
minion to Vilree, and no one but Hallod and a few of
Vilree's other subordinates know about them.

Hallod is here, laying low until the events
surrounding Bort's death blow over.

F1. The Yard  
The yard around the house is choked with weeds and debris from the collapsed house. The area around the willow tree is all but impassible, as the dead branches and leaves have made a large heap around its trunk. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check reveals that someone frequents the property; their trail leads up to the front door, circles the house, and leads down to the stream. A critical success on this check uncovers that the trail never actually goes in through the poorly latched front door.

F2. FRONT DOOR  
The front door to the house no longer sits properly in its frame and is kept from swinging wide open by a simple rope attached to the inside latch. Even with this, it still hangs open about a foot. All of this is a ruse, as this entrance is trapped. (Hallod never goes in using the front door, instead using a window in the back.)

Hazard: The taut rope holding the door disappears into a pile of debris clogging the foyer beyond. Hidden inside the heaps of straw, broken wood, and chunks of plaster is an old heavy crossbow that Hallod has rigged to fire a spear through the doorway if the rope is cut or otherwise released from the door.
