Coiled Opportunity ![inline micro-figure: reaction icon] As Attack of Opportunity, but the serpent can use this reaction only if it's coiled.  
Speed 20 feet, climb 20 feet, swim 20 feet  
Melee ![inline micro-figure: melee icon] fangs +11 (finesse), Damage 1d8+2 piercing plus 1d4 electricity  
Coil ![inline micro-figure: action icon] The serpent uses an action to coil itself; increasing its reach with its fangs from 5 feet to 10 feet. After the serpent strikes with its fangs, it becomes uncoiled.

Lightning Rattle  ◆◆ The serpent rattles its strange metal tail and unleashes a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot line. The bolt deals 2d10 electricity damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save).

Once the giant lightning serpent uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again.

Reward: At the bottom of the shallow pool is the body of an explorer who died here many years ago. Nothing more than bones now, the body has slowly been consumed by limestone that has calcified around its skeleton. A successful DC 15 Perception check spots the body. Anyone who investigates finds the pommel of a weapon sticking out of the stone. Breaking it out will take a hammer and at least 20 minutes of work, but doing so recovers a low-grade silver rapier.

F8. HALLOD'S AMBUSH        SEVERE 1
The tunnel beyond the snake's lair twists and turns for a great distance; it takes the PCs 10 minutes to traverse it before they can detect a faint natural light up ahead, and the air becomes notably cleaner, smelling vaguely of grass. After another 5 minutes of travel, the tunnel opens up into a cave mouth. Read or paraphrase the following to the players.

The tunnel you have been traversing opens into a cave, and you can see a forest beyond the cave's mouth. The roots of a large tree block the middle of this entrance, as if the tree had grown into a hillside that has since eroded away. Beyond the tree is a large pond; a path around the water begins to one side beneath a curtain of moss hanging from the tree. The cave itself is piled high with two rows of neatly stacked crates and boxes.

This cave is where Hallod stored the reagents before delivering them to Vilree at the prearranged drop spot. The thug waits here for the players to arrive, and he has a few traps prepared for them.

**Creature:** Hallod is a rough-looking man. He is bald and has a prominent scar running down his face from an axe wound he took years ago. He is wearing filthy leather armor and wields a nasty kukri with deadly efficiency. When the PCs enter the room, he hops up on a berm formed by the tree roots, aims his crossbow at them, and taunts them by saying, "I wondered when Bort's lackeys would arrive. Let's do this!"

Years ago, Hallod began making use of mutagens
supplied to him by Vilree, but unbeknownst to him,
they were laced with a drug that made them addictive.
Today, Hallod is totally hooked on mutagen and will
do whatever the alchemist demands so long as he can
get his fix. At the start of the fight, he drinks his lesser
juggernaut mutagen, then fires his crossbow and
waits for the PCs to come to him. This also forces
them to deal with his traps.

Hallod,
The final shipment of corpse blood is due in just over a week, and it is the last thing I need from that greedy bastard, Bort. I've enclosed a parting gift for him that should ensure he never tells anyone of our dealings. Be sure that he gets it, my darling.

Drop off the reagents as soon as they arrive. My work is almost done. You will find your usual reward in the stump.

Attack of Opportunity ↷  
Dirty Trick ◇ Trigger Hallod scores a critical hit with a melee attack. Effect Hallod can attempt an Athletics check to Shove or Trip the target of his attack. This uses the same multiple attack penalty as the attack, but it does not count as an additional attack for that penalty.

One-Two Move  Hallod makes two Strikes, one with each hand; he usually attacks first with his kukri. If this first attack hits, the target is flat-footed to the second attack (which for Hallod is usually a fist Strike). The multiple attack penalty applies to these attacks as normal.

**Sneak Attack** Hallod deals 1d6 extra precision damage to flat-footed creatures.

**Hazards:** Hallod has set up a pair of spear launcher traps in this room, with rather obvious trip lines stretching from wall to wall between the rows of barrels and crates (these ropes are marked on the map with dotted lines). Due to this obvious nature, anyone about to enter a space occupied by a trip line can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to notice the trigger. Those that fail trigger the trap. Once seen, the ropes are obviously avoided, but characters cannot end their move in a space occupied by a rope without setting off the trap. Even if the PCs do not trigger the traps, Hallod

uses his Dirty Trick to push characters into them,  
making them trigger the traps.

In addition, if a character is pushed into a crate or box, the container collapses into a pile of broken wood and debris. The character must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d4 piercing damage.

Rewards: Hallod has the key that opens the strongbox in area F6, and the crates here are not all empty. They contain 50 gp worth of alchemical reagents that can be used in Crafting alchemical items, a runestone containing the shadow rune, and 2 everburning torches.

**XP Award:** Bringing Hallod to justice is a significant milestone, worth an 80 XP story award (in addition to the normal XP for defeating the brute).

**Last Missive:** Folded up in Hallod's pocket is a note written on a scrap of parchment. It is in Vilree's handwriting, which is distinctly unlike any of the other writing the PCs have encountered in the adventure to this point. The style is plain and very severe, as if self-taught. See the handout above for details of Vilree's last missive to Hallod.

The Drop Point  
Located about 3 miles outside Etran's Folly, the drop point on Hallod's map is little more than a large hollow tree stump in a small clearing. Inside are a few empty crates, but nothing of value. Knowing this location, however, it vital to learning the location of Vilree's true lair.

UNSOLVED MURDER  
In tracking down Hallod and exploring his hideout, the players have made significant progress in determining who caused the untimely demise of Bort the dwarf merchant. Unfortunately, the villain who ordered the murder is still at large. Even worse, there's no way to learn where this mysterious "V" might be found.

Taking this information to Rolth only adds to the
inept sheriff's worry. Worse than a simple murder,
the PC's investigation has uncovered a nefarious plot
involving secret agents and clandestine deliveries,
with roots stretching back many years. These events
do clear the name of the PCs and of the members
of the caravan, but the sheriff pleads with the PCs
to help him uncover the true culprit. There are two
other factors at play here: Tamli's desire for closure,
and the appearance of a mysterious ranger.

Tamli is keen to hear what happened in the caves underneath Hallod's home. She listens with rapt attention, the knuckles on her clenched hands white with tension, as the story unfolds. Although she is relieved that the man directly responsible for Bort's death has been caught, she grows quiet at the revelation that there was someone else involved. After a moment of silence, she asks how the PCs plan to find the mastermind behind all this, expecting the group to continue the search. Should they balk, a pained look crosses her face, and she retrieves her coin purse to offer them 43 gp in assorted coins to continue the investigation. It is her entire savings, but finding the killer means that much to her and the others.

Around this time (or perhaps just before the heroes go to Hallod's home), a mysterious ranger comes to town dragging a sledge and burdened by the carcasses of several wolves. The body of the caustic wolf from the beginning of this adventure is among the corpses (if the PCs did not bury it). The ranger is looking for whoever is responsible (see the Ranger's Request on page 24 for more information).

Hallod Lives?
It is possible that the PCs took Hallod alive, subduing him rather than killing him. If so, Sheriff Rolth has the thug bound to a post in a locked barn just outside town. Hallod is under constant watch, being held until the circuit judge arrives to mete out justice. The PCs are free to question him, but he refuses to say much of anything until the withdrawal from his mutagen addiction begins to take hold, which takes 3 or 4 days. At that point, Hallod will say just about anything to get another dose. Alternatively, the PCs might be able to coerce information out of Hallod or

THE SECRET OF VILREE  
Vilree's identity and history are not meant  
to be a great secret, but the PCs should have to  
invest some effort in uncovering her backstory.  
There are many people around town who are  
old enough to remember the plague and the dark  
years that followed it, most notably Edra Wythe,
