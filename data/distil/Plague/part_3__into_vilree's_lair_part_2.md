been raised, Nar will be seated here on his throne.
He sleeps on it in the mornings and into the early
afternoon, but he is awake all night, venturing
outside only for food or to relieve himself.

Lord Nar was made the ruler of the orcs shortly
after Vilree took command of the war band. The
ceremony is still talked about in hushed whispers by
the surviving orcs. The previous chief was asked if he
would submit and, when he refused, Vilree burned
him alive using her powerful alchemy. When the
question was posed again, this time to Nar, he readily
agreed. In the years since, Vilree has addicted all of
the orcs to a mild sedative that makes them easier to
manipulate; if the PCs drink from any of the water
sources here or in the caves, they will taste something
odd, but it takes weeks of constant exposure for this
sedative to have any lasting effect.

**Creature:** Nar is a corpulent orc, having grown fat off the luxury of being Vilree's chosen. While the other orcs resent him, they are too afraid of Vilree's power to test her decisions. Nar, for his part, plays up the importance of his role in the war band. He visits Vilree once a week to update her, and while these meetings are usually dull except for the occasional order, Nar likes

to pretend that she is taking his counsel. If threatened
by the heroes, Nar explains that harming him will
incur the lady's wrath and that the PCs had best just
surrender to him if they know what is good for them.

In any event, Nar is not above attacking the
PCs and calling on all his orcs to do the same. The
memory of his predecessor's screams spurs him to
take almost any risk to avoid failure.

Rage ◆ Lord Nar flies into a rage that lasts 1 minute and grants him 8 temporary Hit Points, 4 additional damage with his listed attacks, and a –1 penalty to AC. He cannot use actions that have the concentrate trait while raging, unless they also have the rage trait. Once his rage ends, Nar cannot Rage again for 1 minute.

Rewards: A bronze key hangs from a leather cord around Nar's neck; this unlocks the doors to Spite's Cradle in area I5. Set into the seat of Nar's throne is a hidden compartment containing the war band's riches. It can be opened by simultaneously pressing a pair of buttons disguised as orc eyes in the throne's decorative carving. Inside the compartment is a bag containing 28 gp in silver and copper pieces, a flawed sapphire worth 20 gp, a scroll of heal (2nd level), a scroll of sound burst, and a scroll of restoration. The scrolls belonged to the war band's shaman, who tried to leave soon after Vilree arrived but, unbeknownst to Nar, Vilree captured her and used her to create the Amalgam (see area I16). Finally, the compartment contains a tiny straw doll made to look like Vilree that Nar keeps here to practice talking to his mistress. It even has hairs collected from her comb that he has lovingly placed on its head.

14. SLEEPING CAVES                LOW/MODERATE 3

The cave opening reveals a connected pair of cramped chambers that stink of sweat and campfire smoke. The floor is covered in debris and piles of filth. Almost a dozen sleeping mats are nestled in nooks and built into the walls throughout this space.

The orcs use these two caves as their home; unless the alarm has been raised, this chamber usually has a few orcs in it at all times.

**Creatures:** A total of eight orcs sleep in these chambers, although there is space for almost a dozen. Most of the bedrolls on the map actually indicate two nooks, one above and one below, both with sleeping mats and personal effects. During the day, there are usually five orcs here, with two in the yard and one more up in the tower with Graytusk. At night the number drops to just three, with four in the yard and a different orc up in the tower with Graytusk. If a fight breaks out in area 14, the orcs here will come to investigate during the second round of combat, using the first round to gather their weapons, entering the throne room singly or in pairs.

**Rewards:** The orcs do not have much of value, but there are a few things of interest to be found here. Scattered among the nooks is 37 sp, 52 cp, and a lot of damaged or shoddy common items (such as ropes, whetstones, backpacks, and candles). If the PCs are looking for something in particular, there is a 50% chance they can find it so long as the item is not magical and has a value of 5 sp or less. Anyone searching the caves can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to find a small cache located under a rock beneath a bedroll. This cache contains an *invisibility potion* and a silver key (worth 1 gp) that unlocks the door to area **I8**.

15. Reception Hall                        Moderate 3
The large double door leading into Spite's Cradle are made from heavy wooden planks reinforced with iron bands. They are locked from the inside with an average quality lock, but can be opened with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks or by using the bronze key that Lord Nar wears around his neck. The doors are emblazoned with the image of a small village in flames. This is clearly based on the image on the doors leading to the Sculptor's chambers in the Pen, but it is more refined and was made by a more practiced hand.

Once the PCs find a way inside, read or paraphrase the following.

The doors swing wide to reveal a small reception hall. A worn carpet stretches from the doors to another double door across the way. To the right is a curved wall with a map of the nearby area painted on it. Spite's Cradle is in the center, with lines drawn to all of the nearby major settlements and noting travel times by horse. Where Etran's Folly should be, there is only a simple legend that reads "Ruins of Plaguestone."

The map gives only the broadest
implication of Vilree's plans. After
destroying Etran's Folly, she plans to slowly
build a web of domination over the region using
alchemical drugs and coercion to establish a
hidden empire.

**Creatures:** Two years ago, when Vilree was first experimenting with energy mutagens, she paid a hedge mage to bind a pair of minor air elementals to her service so that she could learn more about the elemental forces. After her research took her elsewhere, she placed the elementals here to serve as guardians, ordering them to attack anyone who enters the room who does not belong. Once the PCs enter, the wind suddenly picks up as the elemental takes shape and attacks.

16. GUARD TOWER                                    LOW 3  
This tower actually consists of two locations: the  
tower's interior and its covered rooftop. The area  
shown on the map is the interior. The rooftop area's  
only noteworthy features are a hatch granting access  
to the tower interior via a ladder and a bucket with  
100 arrows.

**Creatures:** There are always two orcs in this location. One is an ordinary guard, from among those who dwell with Lord Nar. The other is Graytusk, the only capable hunter and tracker among the orcs. Unless she is out on the hunt, Graytusk spends all her time in the tower, either watching from the rooftop or getting a few hours of sleep in the interior room.

As noted in area 11, the primary job of the orcs here
