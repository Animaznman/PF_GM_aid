Beyond the door, the foyer empties into a clearly
abandoned living space. The hearth is choked with
branches and debris from above, the furniture is
smashed and soiled, and a thick layer of dirt and
grime covers every surface. It is obvious that no
one has used this room in years. The only other exit
leads to a room thoroughly filled with debris from
the collapsed roof above. Digging through the debris
would take several hours at least and would likely
cause a further collapse of the ruined second story
above. If the PCs do find a way through, they enter
area F4 without needing to use the hidden window
entrance (F3).

F3. HIDDEN WINDOW ENTRANCE  
The footpath that leads around the house passes under a boarded-over window at the back of the house, then down to the stream where Hallod gets water. The boarded-over window is fake; Hallod nailed the boards onto a hinged shutter, allowing it to be opened with ease. This ruse is not simple to detect, but careful inspection and a successful DC 16 Perception check uncovers it.

The shutter is latched from the inside, and there  
does not appear to be a keyhole of any sort, but due  
to its roughly constructed nature, the shutter can  
be opened with a successful DC 16 Thievery check  
(trained) or Forced Open with a successful DC 18  
Athletics check.

F4. CRAWLWAY AND HATCH  
The shuttered entrance leads to a room filled with debris from the collapsed roof. There's just enough room for two Medium creatures to stand in this space, and a cursory inspection from this spot uncovers a crawlway under the debris. Unlike everything else, this crawlway is mostly free from grime and dust. Characters can move through the crawlway only in single file. Medium creatures can crawl 5 feet per action; Small and smaller creatures can move at normal speed.

Hazard: After 15 feet, the crawlway takes a left turn. There is a trap located in the floor at this spot. Anyone putting pressure on the floor where the crawlway turns sets off the trap: debris rains down

from the ceiling, trapping the victim and making the  
passageway impossible to navigate.

FALLING DEBRIS                        HAZARD 1

MECHANICAL   TRAP

Stealth DC 17 (trained)
Description A pressure-sensitive floorboard connects to a beam holding up debris in the crawlway's ceiling.

Disable Thievery DC 15 (trained) on the floorboard before the debris falls
AC 16; Fort +8, Ref +2
Hardness 5; HP 20 (BT 10); Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Falling Debris Trigger Pressure is placed on the floorboard. Effect The ceiling in the crawlway collapses in the square where the passage turns, and also in the two adjacent squares. Anyone in these three squares takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage. For the creature in the center square, where the trap is triggered, this is a basic save. Creatures in the two adjacent squares take no damage on a success or critical success as they avoid the falling debris entirely, but take full damage on a failed save, and take double damage on a critical failure. Creatures that take damage from the debris are immobilized, trapped under the crushing weight.

Clearing out a square of debris requires a successful DC 17 Athletics skill check, with the following effects.
  Critical Success The square is cleared in 1 minute.
  Success The square is cleared in 5 minutes.
  Failure The square is cleared in 10 minutes.
  Critical Failure The ceiling above the square collapses further, dealing an additional 2d6 to the character digging out the square and any character trapped in that square. This takes 1 minute and no progress is made.

Beyond the turn, the crawlway continues for
another 10 feet before opening up into a small
chamber that appears to have once been a closet.
The door leaving the space is barred by debris on the
other side and cannot be opened, but there is a hatch
built into the floor. It is very old, but free from debris
and dust. The hatch is not locked, but the hinge is
terribly rusted. Opening it without making any noise
requires a successful DC 18 Thievery check, although
applying oil to the hinge reduces this to DC 12. If the
PCs make noise lifting the hatch, Hallod has even
more time to prepare for the PCs arrival, as noted
in F5, below.

Under the hatch is a stone-lined chute that descends  
almost 30 feet. Handholds have been carved into the

stone wall, but they are uneven and treacherous.
There is no light in the chute. Unless the PCs have
a way to bring light with them, climbing down the
chute requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check.
With light, the going is slow, but no check is required.
The chute ends in area F5, down in the basement.
  XP Award: For dealing with both of Hallod's
hazards, award the party 30 XP.

F5. BASEMENT KENNEL                MODERATE 1
The chute deposits the PCs into a short hallway that leads to a wooden door. The door is not locked, and it leads into the deep basement of the house above. When the PCs open the door, read or paraphrase the following.

The old wooden door swings open on rusted hinges, revealing a room lit by a single, flickering torch. Through the gloom you see piles of small crates and more than a few barrels stacked up haphazardly on the south side of the room. Opposite you is a stout wooden door with iron bands, while the north side of the room is bare save for an iron gate set into the middle of the wall. The stench of smoke and damp dog hangs heavy in the air.

If the PCs made a great deal of noise in opening the hatch, Hallod had plenty of time to set up an additional danger for them by spilling a few pints of alchemical grease on the area in front of the door. The oil covers the square directly in front of the door and the squares adjacent to that one. Anyone attempting to move through these spaces by means other than a Step must attempt a DC 13 Acrobatics check or Reflex saving throw or fall prone.

The door leading out of this room into area **F6** is locked, but it can be opened with two successful DC 15 Thievery skill checks. It can also be Forced Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or by dealing 40 points of damage to the door (Hardness 10).

**Creatures:** Even if the PCs did not make noise while opening the hatch, they cannot possibly make it down the chute without alerting Hallod, who then stations himself beyond the wooden door to area **F6.** Watching through a slit in the door, he begins turning a wheel that raises the iron gate as soon as the PCs enter the room. This releases four angry and starving guard dogs into the room. Their barks and growls flood the room the moment the grate begins to move.
