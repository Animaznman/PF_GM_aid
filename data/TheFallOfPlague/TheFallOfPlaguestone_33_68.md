H2. The Yard                                   Severe 2

On the other side of the wall of brambles is a yard dominated by three large, wooden cages and a pool of bubbling sludge. A wretched-looking horse stands in one <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.259,r=0.526,b=0.345), with ID 00801e81-6b71-4e12-bbf4-5dc88000a55e -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a horse composed entirely of stone, labeled "Stone Horse," depicted in a dynamic pose on a rocky surface.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a horse whose body, head, and limbs are made of textured, cracked stone.
  • The horse is rearing with one front leg raised, standing on a rocky ground.
  • The eyes glow with a yellowish light, adding a supernatural effect.
  • The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and muted earth tones, with some yellow in the eyes.
  • The composition is side-on, showing the full body of the horse, with the head turned slightly toward the viewer.

Technical Details :
  • There is a visible label at the bottom reading "Stone Horse."
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  • The illustration is detailed, with emphasis on the stone texture and cracks throughout the horse's body.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The horse occupies the central and right portion of the image, with its raised leg and head creating a sense of movement.
  • The rocky ground is in the foreground, with the horse's hooves interacting with it.
  • The background is mostly white, with some foliage visible at the left edge.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a fantastical or mythical creature, blending the form of a horse with the material properties of stone.
  • The glowing eyes and dynamic pose suggest power and animation, despite the stone composition.
  • The label "Stone Horse" clearly identifies the subject for viewers. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.350,r=0.552,b=0.911), with ID 4efae1ef-b456-4b36-b455-5af917962106 -->

of the cages, while another cage is filled with a swarm
of gigantic rats covered in white blisters. The third pen
looks empty, but it appears to be built around a small cave
located in the hillside. There is another cave entrance on
the north side, near one of the pens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.125,r=0.891,b=0.205), with ID 7b913363-28c6-4c07-929b-e2ba469ac59e -->

This yard is used by the orcs to house some of their more successful experiments, and while these creatures are not exactly loyal, they are quite dangerous when allowed to run free. This is especially true if the PCs gave the orcs here ample warning of their approach by destroying the thorn iris instead of finding a way to open it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.218,r=0.891,b=0.325), with ID 819f60c9-f5e4-48d9-a26d-01252bfd458d -->

**Creatures:** There are two orcs in this area as well as the caged experiments. If the PCs catch the orcs unaware, one of them is dumping a bucket of sludge into the pool when the PCs open the iris, while the other is in front of the horse’s cage (the northernmost cage on the map). When combat starts, the first orc flings his bucket at the nearest PC, a ranged attack with a +4 bonus that deals 1d6 acid damage plus 1 persistent acid damage. He then charges up to attack. Meanwhile, the second orc opens the horse’s cage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.479), with ID e3709d39-fabb-4319-840f-442fbf65278e -->

If the PCs alert the orcs to their approach, both are positioned at a cage door—one at the door with the horse, the other perched atop the cage with the rats. The moment the door is breached, the orcs open their respective cages, making this an especially deadly battle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.480,r=0.891,b=0.571), with ID bf0b5a7f-020c-4772-a5ce-0c7d08855ca8 -->

Opening a cage requires 2 actions (one to unlock the cage, and a second to open the door). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.565,t=0.571,r=0.890,b=0.602), with ID f7ea4222-e378-4631-93f5-d33deefbc4cd -->

North Cage: This cage contains a warhorse that the orcs have been experimenting on for some time now. Despite their ministrations and the creature’s half-starved condition, the beast is loyal to them. Its flesh has a stony appearance and its hooves appear to be made of metal. The moment the horse’s cage is open, it dashes forward to attack. If for some reason the door is not opened, the horse grows very agitated as the orcs are slain. When the last of them falls, it rears up to shatter the door of its pen and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.679,r=0.892,b=0.861), with ID a8699066-919d-4880-af31-b08c97f822d5 -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar from a fantasy adventure book, listing the main sections or chapters of the adventure in a stylized, alchemical-themed frame.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical, ornate frame resembling purple, viscous liquid or magical ooze, with embedded glass vials and a glowing, mystical motif at the top.
  • The frame encloses a parchment-like panel listing four adventure sections: "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder", "Part 2: The Ranger's Request", "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair", and "Adventure Toolbox".
  • The illustration uses a palette of purples, greens, and golds, with sparkles and magical highlights.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is clear and legible, with a fantasy-style font.
  • The illustration is vertically oriented, with the list of parts running from top to bottom.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The decorative frame surrounds the text, with vials and magical motifs at the top and bottom.
  • The text is centered within the frame, with each part listed in sequence.

Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for a fantasy adventure, using alchemical and magical motifs to reinforce the genre and mood. The sequential listing of parts provides a clear overview of the adventure's structure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.787,t=0.084,r=1.003,b=0.737), with ID 88f6f167-e843-46b5-86e2-71eaf59a1e05 -->

Shattering Hooves The hooves of the stone horse are as hard as iron; if the horse makes a Hoof Strike and gets a critical hit, the target’s armor is damaged as well, the attack dealing as much damage to the armor as it dealt to the target (Hardness applies as normal). If the target uses shield block against the stone horse’s critical hit with a hoof attack, treat the shield’s Hardness as 5 points lower (minimum 0). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.125,r=0.453,b=0.326), with ID db65400f-2a94-4609-8925-72a4365b9820 -->

**Icy Death** When an icy rat is slain, its body explodes in a burst of frozen fur and bone, dealing 2d4 cold damage to all adjacent creatures (DC 14 basic Reflex save). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.587,r=0.445,b=0.649), with ID bcd81da1-8984-4816-81e6-226c166d7c40 -->

**South Cage:** This cage appears to be empty, but the floor is littered with the bones of previous inhabitants and scraps from the meals that fed them. There is an opening in the back wall of the cage that leads to area **H3**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.663,r=0.452,b=0.740), with ID 113627b0-4ea9-41de-b2bf-4edb7beb6fc8 -->

Hazard: The large pool of toxic sludge in the center of this area is a hazard to any who draw near. Randomly determine the direction of the wind at the start of the fight by rolling 1d8; a result of 1 indicates the wind is blowing north, a 2 is northeast, and so on, moving clockwise to an 8, which indicates the wind is blowing northwest. The fumes are especially strong in the direction indicated, creating a draft that stretches 20 feet from the pool. Any creature that starts its turn in this draft takes 1d4 acid damage and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (falling into or entering the pool deals an extra 1d4 acid damage in addition to the normal effect). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.740,r=0.452,b=0.940), with ID 094538bb-d81d-4156-87df-f9c4dc66156e -->

Each round, check to see if the wind shifts
slightly by rolling 1d8; on a result of 1–2,
the wind shifts one direction clockwise (from
south to southwest, for example), on a result of
3–6 it stays the same, and on a result of 7–8 it
shifts one direction counterclockwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.126,r=0.790,b=0.218), with ID a1ec259e-ce3a-4433-a8ac-c4d173b56ad2 -->

Regardless of the wind direction and the acid  
fumes, anyone adjacent to the toxic pool at the start  
of their turn takes 1d4 acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.219,r=0.817,b=0.264), with ID d1c98f4a-afda-4693-a421-ecad8badd4a4 -->

### H3. The Black Cave
This cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.276,r=0.818,b=0.372), with ID 01206a8a-5c74-42a2-9e81-579bf27dda4e -->

Opening the cage door does not anger the leopard or cause it to attack. Instead, it waits inside the cave, in agony from experiments performed upon it by the orcs. When the PCs enter the cave, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.373,r=0.819,b=0.450), with ID 44ad1501-04b3-40ca-b314-6538fab00814 -->

Stepping inside the cave, a cloud of smoke hovering around the ceiling becomes visible. Curled up in the back of the cave is a cat that looks to be on fire. It glares at the sight of another creature entering, letting out a weak snarl that fades into a plaintive yowl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.462,r=0.818,b=0.543), with ID 8e912aa0-bfba-4e4e-97ef-5e350bcad823 -->

**Creature:** The fiery leopard is in far too much pain to fight the PCs unless they provoke it. Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation. A character trained in Nature can approach the leopard and calm it with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy skill check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check. A critical failure on this check causes it to attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.819,b=0.678), with ID 76f1744c-a39c-4260-9764-49d7e58b09fc -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar from a fantasy adventure book, listing the main sections of an adventure module in a stylized, magical frame.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image features a vertical, ornate frame resembling purple, organic, magical ooze with glowing orange sparkles and fantasy plant elements at the top.
  • At the top, a potion flask and green tendrils are visible, enhancing the magical theme.
  • The interior of the frame contains a parchment-like background with a list of adventure sections in black text.
  • At the bottom, a small vial and more sparkles are present, reinforcing the alchemical motif.
  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and golds, with a mystical, whimsical style.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation.
  • The text within the frame reads:
    - "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder"
    - "Part 2: The Ranger's Request"
    - "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair"
    - "Adventure Toolbox"
  • The text is centered and uses a serif font.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The frame is vertically elongated, with decorative elements concentrated at the top and bottom.
  • The text is evenly spaced down the center of the parchment area.
  • The potion flask and plant are at the top, while the vial is at the bottom, creating a visual balance.

Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for a fantasy adventure, using magical and alchemical motifs to set the tone.
  • The design draws the reader’s eye from top to bottom, guiding them through the adventure’s structure in a visually engaging way. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.807,t=0.083,r=1.000,b=0.760), with ID dfe29f7a-0f12-4b1e-85f1-9e0bdb594348 -->

Although the fiery leopard will not allow itself
to be handled, and anyone attempting to touch it
takes 1 point of fire damage, the PCs can alleviate
the animal’s suffering if they can first calm it. Most
obviously, the poor creature is in need of water,
but any it tries to drink is quickly boiled off by the
leopard’s intense heat. Chilling the water first with
a ray of frost or similar effect allows the leopard
to hydrate before its fire evaporates the water. A
successful DC 15 Medicine check reveals that the
leopard has also been wounded, probably by the orcs
when they were handling it. Healing the fiery leopard
for 3 Hit Points restores it to full health. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.325), with ID f038f888-1453-4760-a383-aed5abb24043 -->

If the PCs hydrate the leopard and heal its wounds, it perks up noticeably. At this point, it just wants to escape this place; if the PCs allow it, the leopard bolts out of the cage, into the yard, up a wall, and out of the Pen. Alternatively, the PCs might try to transfer the leopard to a new cage and move it, but that is difficult even after it has been healed. It does not fully trust the characters, and touching it still results in fire damage. The chance of success here is up to you to decide, but it should at least involve a few skill checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.326,r=0.525,b=0.493), with ID 9a96a9a0-16b0-4175-8a45-f7492b4f3478 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a leopard with flames emanating from its body, accompanied by a label reading "Fiery Leopard".

photo:  
Scene Overview :  
  • The main subject is a snarling leopard, depicted in a dynamic, aggressive pose with its mouth open and teeth bared.  
  • Flames are illustrated as emerging from various parts of the leopard's body, including its back, head, legs, and tail, giving the impression that the animal is on fire.  
  • The leopard stands on a dark, flat rock or platform, which is shaded to suggest depth.  
  • The background is plain white, isolating the subject and emphasizing the dramatic effect of the flames.  
  • The color palette includes naturalistic leopard colors (yellows, browns, and black spots) contrasted with bright orange and yellow flames.

Technical Details :  
  • There is a rectangular label at the bottom right of the image with the text "Fiery Leopard" in white on a dark green background.  
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.  
  • The illustration style is semi-realistic, with detailed fur and flame effects.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The leopard is positioned diagonally, facing forward and slightly to the left, with its front left paw extended toward the viewer.  
  • Flames are distributed across the body, with larger flames on the back and head, and smaller flames on the limbs and tail.  
  • The label "Fiery Leopard" is placed in the foreground, partially overlapping the rock.

Analysis :  
  • The image conveys a sense of power, aggression, and supernatural energy, likely intended to represent a mythical or magical creature.  
  • The flames are integrated into the leopard's form, suggesting that the fire is a natural part of the animal rather than an external effect.  
  • The plain background and dramatic pose focus attention on the subject, enhancing its visual impact. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.066,t=0.497,r=0.533,b=0.945), with ID f2725226-6cd6-407c-b492-495eaa0615cb -->

If the characters help and release the leopard, they might see it again; if a character has the right feats, they might acquire the unique creature as an animal companion (see the Rules and Rewards section on page 57 for details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.891,b=0.203), with ID d0c4d579-8b68-4a26-81c2-21308cbe731e -->

H4. FOREST LABORATORY                MODERATE 2

The bright light from outside is replaced by flickering torchlight in a narrow passageway cut deeply into the hillside. Suddenly, the passage opens into a broad natural cavern containing a series of large tables on the far side of the room. A series of alchemical experiments, most bubbling and frothing as they cook, are arranged atop the work spaces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.245,r=0.891,b=0.388), with ID be979bbb-4555-4d9d-92dd-6e48d596508f -->

This chamber is the primary alchemical workshop
for the Pen, and it is where the orcs administer the
concoctions sent to them by Vilree. The Sculptor has
recently begun using the tools and reagents here to
work on experiments of his own; Vilree is unaware
of this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.402,r=0.890,b=0.493), with ID 521b9d93-bfd0-4996-887c-7bab725b4fbd -->

**Creatures:** There are a pair of orcs here, brothers who assist the Sculptor, watching over the cauldrons and reactions as they slowly simmer and bubble. They are near the workbenches when the PCs enter, but they promptly howl in rage and attack. In addition to using the alchemical weapons they have on them, the orcs favor grabbing random vials off the tables and throwing them at the PCs (see Hazards below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.496,r=0.890,b=0.617), with ID 4da2c0fc-c6d1-4bc3-af57-14dd5087af5f -->

**Hazards:** The tables are covered with actively cooking reagents, half-finished alchemical items, and other dangerous equipment. If left unattended for ten minutes, the cooking reagents can start a fire in the laboratory; the orc alchemists also know how to intentionally use this equipment for dangerous ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.171,r=0.452,b=0.264), with ID 345ecbe7-9c9e-4242-94d2-d304a5a9af37 -->

A creature adjacent to a table can grab an item from it as an action and use a second action to throw or otherwise use it. Roll on the Random Alchemy table to determine what was grabbed. If a character first takes the Seek action and succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check, they can roughly identify the items before grabbing one, allowing them to roll twice on the Random Alchemy table and choose the preferred result. The orc alchemists always roll twice, taking whatever result you prefer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.265,r=0.452,b=0.418), with ID 525be022-b7e2-42b1-9dd1-3b73febce94f -->

A character can Shove over a table or cauldron, requiring a successful DC 15 Athletics check. This causes everything on the table or in that cauldron to be ruined, posing a risk to anyone who might be hit by an explosive concoction. If a table is pushed over toward a creature, all creatures adjacent to that edge of the table are hit by a number of alchemical experiments, with a DC 18 Reflex saving throw determining the number: a critical success avoids them all, a success indicates the character is hit by one experiment, a failure indicates the character is hit by two, and a character who gets a critical failure is hit by three. Roll each experiment on the Random Alchemy table. Once a table has been knocked over, no one can grab a random experiment from it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.586,r=0.452,b=0.830), with ID d7ddf953-bf1e-48e2-9229-aea6ffc2c3dd -->

If a cauldron is overturned, roll on the Random
Alchemy table to determine what was in the cauldron,
and any creature in the square the cauldron was
emptied into takes triple the effects of the alchemical
item that was rolled (the effect can’t be tripled in the
case of a tanglefoot bag). The character may attempt
a DC 18 basic Reflex save, but this save should be <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.833,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID e3434979-efb5-4cf3-add4-698db64ba9df -->

rolled before the contents of the cauldron  
are revealed and, if the cauldron contained  
elixir of life, the Hit Points it heals are reduced  
by the saving throw. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.126,r=0.784,b=0.188), with ID 1202a4dc-c346-4b1d-93e5-cc065e6c389d -->

Rewards: In addition to any gear the PCs might salvage from the alchemists, there are a few other things here they might recover. For each table that was not knocked over, roll twice on the Random Alchemy table. Those items can be taken as long as someone succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check to finish them (roll for each item). There is also 20 gp worth of alchemical reagents here that an alchemist can use to craft additional items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.189,r=0.818,b=0.326), with ID cd23c362-37e5-4fb2-bcfe-429f5f87eed5 -->

### H5. STORAGE CAVE
This area is used primarily for storage of alchemical gear and reagents. Anyone can tell that most of the barrels and crates are quite old, but the gear and equipment in the laboratory is of the same style and make and looks as if it may have once been stored here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.338,r=0.818,b=0.447), with ID 96ce8530-15c7-4215-9cea-e4e9a10bac59 -->

In fact, Vilree left all this behind when she
moved to Spite’s Cradle years ago. The Sculptor
and his assistants began to experiment with the
gear six months ago and set up the laboratory to
make elixirs, bombs, and other alchemical tools. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.449,r=0.817,b=0.525), with ID 5ccafcae-1f62-47bf-95f6-444180b6b287 -->

The equipment here is old but quite valuable to
the right buyer. If the PCs returned with a wagon,
they could load it all up and sell it. The ultimate
value is up to you, but it should be no more than
about 100 gp, and the PCs would have to travel to
Almas or another large city to find such a wealthy
buyer. Alternatively, they could sell it all to Delma or
Tamli for one quarter its value. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.526,r=0.817,b=0.648), with ID 8c41d263-4d62-4d6c-a08f-3ba3be92dd49 -->

## H6. REFUSE PIT
The door from the laboratory into this area is secured with a simple wooden bar on the laboratory side. There is also a secret door leading into the chamber from the lair of the Sculptor (area H7). That door is hidden from both sides and can be found only by searching that square and succeeding at a DC 22 Perception check. The cavern is strewn with refuse such as bones and broken equipment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.660,r=0.818,b=0.800), with ID ee42683c-2815-45d4-9207-d30e9553fa66 -->

**Rewards:** Scattered among the bones are a few trinkets, including a low-grade cold iron dagger, a _wolf fang_ talisman, and 8 gp in miscellaneous coins. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.802,r=0.818,b=0.847), with ID 2791b47d-358e-434a-b258-aab0539c1c73 -->

H7. LAIR OF THE SCULPTOR                HIGH 2
The northernmost passageway that exits the laboratory ends in a set of stairs that leads up to a massive double door to the west.

crudely decorated with a carving of a small rural
village that has been set ablaze. Anyone examining
the carving can tell it must have been made many
years ago and, despite its poor overall artistry, the
village bears an unmistakable resemblance to Etran’s
Folly. The doors are not locked. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.218), with ID cda18d52-a2c6-4211-8826-b5dd781755f5 -->

This chamber is the lair of the Sculptor, the orc who runs the Pen. When he and the other orcs were asked to hold this place by Vilree several years ago, they initially resented the duty and preferred to stay with the war band. Over time, however, the orcs have come to appreciate their freedom here and enjoy the experiments they are asked to perform. The leader, in particular, became interested in alchemy and took on the nickname “the Sculptor” in the hope he might one day impress Vilree with his talents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.219,r=0.526,b=0.372), with ID 56559d8f-4b7c-4935-ad91-f5d6ee446515 -->

Creature: There is a very good chance the Sculptor heard the fight through the door and knows the PCs are coming. If this is the case, he is standing by the door to area H8 when the PCs enter, prepared to open it the moment they arrive and flee to the blood ooze, hoping to use his final experiment to stop them. In any case, he tries not to fight in this room, using alchemy and whatever minions he has available to slow the PCs down while he escapes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.372,r=0.484,b=0.618), with ID 895160db-77de-4efb-ad26-6ced8ab3b7b5 -->

The Sculptor is a canny foe who will stay in the fight so long as it goes his way, but he will attempt to flee when he thinks he’s losing. If he unleashes the blood ooze (area H8) against the PCs, he stays in the fight as long as his minions take the brunt of the PCs’ damage; harrying the PCs with bombs whenever he can. When out of options, he attempts to flee the Pen, leaving through the refuse pit, through the laboratory, past the cages, and out into the wilderness. If he is reduced to half Hit Points or fewer, he does not escape; Noala spots him as he flees and hunts him down. If the Sculptor has more than half his Hit Points remaining, he wounds Noala with alchemist’s fire and traps her with a tanglefoot bag to allow his escape. Should this happen, he flees to Vilree and can be found somewhere in Spite’s Cradle later on (likely in a laboratory). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.280,r=0.895,b=0.601), with ID 02d0b131-2c81-4715-bd69-34d513499f9d -->

**Rewards:** In addition to the gear and items carried by the Sculptor, there are a few other critical things to be discovered in this room. A small stash of coins worth 18 gp and a fine set of silver scales worth 30 gp sit atop the desk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.618,t=0.602,r=0.893,b=0.693), with ID 9f92cf7d-98e9-46b3-b0f3-606bfbfd8f20 -->

This room also contains a trove
of valuable information about what
Vilree was hoping to accomplish here.
Most of the texts are written in Orc,
as they are the Sculptor’s notes on
the various experiments he has been
asked to perform over the past few
months. Almost all of these involve
evolving permanent mutations in
creatures by exposing them to energy
mutagens (see Rules and Rewards on
page 56 for more information). While
many of these experiments were
ultimately successful, they had an
unintended side effect: the creatures
became far too bestial and unreliable <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.631,t=0.694,r=0.894,b=0.941), with ID 16c99198-c3c5-4785-83d9-1878301c2cf8 -->

*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.304,t=0.001,r=0.695,b=0.016), with ID 0a3f7723-7fb2-4683-bc09-a61f5ab95dab -->

to use as minions. About 2 months ago, something
changed, and Vilree stopped asking him to perform
experiments without offering an explanation. The
Sculptor took it upon himself to continue the work,
with varied and unpredictable results, and a number
of creatures escaped. One of the most recent notes
says, “The coagulant thing is finally taking shape. It
might not be what she asked for, but she is sure to be
impressed! When it is ready, I will take it to Spite’s
Cradle and show it to the mistress myself.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.126,r=0.456,b=0.279), with ID a3c845cc-b5bb-48be-8716-ae414e994083 -->

All of this can be uncovered by spending a few
hours going through the Sculptor’s notes, although
a broad outline of it can be uncovered in an hour
or so with a successful DC 15 Crafting check. Any
character that examines the notes should be allowed
a DC 18 Perception check to notice an unusual
entry: about 3 years ago, Vilree commanded the orcs
to capture a human. This person was placed in a
covered pit in the woods and exposed to something
that the Sculptor refers to as the viridian vapor. The
last note on this experiment reads, “The human died
in agony in less than a day. We burned his body and
filled in the pit as instructed.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.280,r=0.456,b=0.479), with ID 58a42cf6-3e42-4b8d-9aa0-63ed316211f2 -->

**XP Award:** After the PCs defeating the Sculptor and examine his notes, award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.480,r=0.454,b=0.512), with ID a0e14a1a-7c5d-4be6-a31f-d490186fa469 -->

H8. THE TRUE EXPERIMENT        MODERATE 2
From the moment the door to this area is opened, whimpering moans can be heard from the center of the chamber, where a human man is strapped to a large rack. His flesh is missing in places, replaced with large glass and metal cauldrons that seem to be extracting blood from him, mixing that blood with reagents to transform it, then pumping the blood back into the poor man. Around the room, the PCs can see shackles mounted to the wall where previous prisoners must have spent their final moments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.520,r=0.456,b=0.693), with ID dbaddb26-defb-4915-ace4-4f91237b532a -->

**Creature:** The danger here is a newly created blood ooze that the Sculptor made by extracting the blood from several humanoids and mixing it with a soup of alchemical reagents. The ooze is currently inside the human prisoner, where it is being fed by blood that is drained from the human’s body, transformed, then pumped back in. While the Sculptor knows how to keep the ooze docile using a spray of caustic agents he keeps on a table just inside the room, anyone else that approaches the body causes the ooze to burst from its human enclosure and attack, desperately hungry for more blood. If the Sculptor has fled here, he unleashes the blood ooze, using a powdered blood coagulant in his pouch to drive the ooze toward the PCs (he can try three times before running out). To herd <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.694,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID 5dd8a7d7-9a8d-4ea0-84e2-4b2003271886 -->

the ooze in this way, the Sculptor must
succeed at a DC 19 Crafting check, with
results analogous to the Command an Animal
task of the Nature skill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.125,r=0.784,b=0.191), with ID 2743a079-b317-4eb2-958b-37e9c7c2e061 -->

The victim in this chamber is far too gone to be saved, especially since the blood ooze takes the last of his blood as it departs his body. He was a farmer named Pindro from the outskirts of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.263,r=0.820,b=0.325), with ID cac3ee58-99fd-4323-860f-c17137c35a20 -->

There is little to be learned in this chamber, with
one vital exception: an old set of delivery instructions
is pinned to the north wall of the room, placed there to
help the orcs find their way back to Vilree’s lair in the
hills to the west. They have not needed it in some time,
but to the PCs it is invaluable, as it includes directions
to Spite’s Cradle from “Hallod’s drop-off stump.”
Combined with the map to the stump from Hallod’s
hideout, the PCs now have enough information to
track down Vilree, the villain behind everything. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.326,r=0.820,b=0.479), with ID 3182a99e-d094-4048-954d-b3c18ecbcda7 -->

**XP Award:** Completing the Pen is a major accomplishment, and the PCs should be awarded an 80 XP story award for bringing the terrible experiments here to an end. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.480,r=0.820,b=0.542), with ID 138a518a-ac60-46b9-9fe5-b9a7496e85df -->

NOALA'S REQUEST  
After dealing with the creatures in the Pen, the PCs can meet up with Noala outside. She prevented a few corrupted animals from escaping, but she says they were nothing too serious (unless the Sculptor escaped, as noted in area H7). In any event, she is far more interested in learning what happened to the PCs inside the blight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.549,r=0.813,b=0.678), with ID a058d799-a6e0-4dea-a641-270649a7a728 -->

The PCs’ tale greatly disturbs Noala, but she is
relieved to hear the orcs will be conducting no more
experiments in her woods. Unfortunately, Noala
does not believe that this one laboratory could
possibly be responsible for all of the blights she has
located. She suspects that Vilree must be ultimately
responsible, and she implores the PCs to bring the
alchemist to justice “for Bort’s sake, if not for the
sake of the woods.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.678,r=0.819,b=0.816), with ID 1a1f016d-cce8-4b90-b297-7af79ef3fafb -->

If the PCs ask Noala to accompany them to Spite’s Cradle, she is humbled but ultimately declines, citing that her place is in the woods. Until this threat has been removed, keeping the forest safe is a full-time job. She wishes the PCs well and promises to share some of the secrets of the forest with them through training upon their return (see Noala’s Training in the Rules and Rewards section on page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.816,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID 22adb52c-25c7-4e7c-ab1f-c76daa497512 -->

Once the PCs have learned the information from the Pen, they likely know that Vilree is the person responsible for not only ordering Bort’s poisoning, but also for the blights near Etran’s Folly and the mutated monsters that have spawned there. The PCs must find Vilree’s lair in the wilderness and bring her to justice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.176,t=0.570,r=0.526,b=0.680), with ID 9327fa1c-f577-4fc6-bca4-839ef350e96b -->

# SPITE’S CRADLE
Some twenty miles west of Etran’s Folly are the
foothills at the edge of the Five Kings Mountains. A
few years ago, it was here that Vilree found a small
war band of orcs living in a complex cave system
situated in a narrow limestone valley left behind
when a creek dried up long ago. In the depths of
these caves, Vilree found crystals and other reagents
that would prove invaluable to her research. She
used her alchemy to enslave the orcs, killing their
chief and installing a more suitable replacement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.688,r=0.526,b=0.862), with ID 92d3746b-8e1c-47f0-a2fa-91322fa32230 -->

In the years that followed, she turned the caves
into a small fortress where she could practice her
alchemy and plan the ruin of Etran’s Folly. She
named the fortress Spite’s Cradle, as it was here
that she would nurture her hatred for the people <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.862,r=0.526,b=0.940), with ID 98530bb3-8dd5-4acb-a5ea-c54bd974e925 -->

who caused the death of her mother, treated her as
an outcast, and left her to die.
   Now, on the eve of her revenge, the PCs have
discovered her lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.572,r=0.893,b=0.632), with ID d54dd8e6-a6f6-4557-9c38-6df49a1eacf1 -->

The inside of Vilree’s fortress (areas **15–117**) is lit
by sputtering torches. The walls are stone and the
ceilings are about 9 feet high. The orc lair (areas **13**
and **14**) is not lit, and neither are the natural caves
down in the depths (areas **118** and **119**). Vilree’s
innermost sanctum (area **120**) is lit by the glowing
crystal formations that line the cave walls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.633,r=0.893,b=0.740), with ID 0148e723-4b45-4159-a517-114989d3a6d9 -->

11. The Gate  
Using the map to the drop point from Hallod’s Hideout and the directions from the Pen, the PCs can easily find Spite’s Cradle. On foot, it takes 7 or 8 hours to reach the place, although if the PCs manage to borrow or buy some horses, they can reduce that time to about 5 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.752,r=0.891,b=0.848), with ID ab598a85-82e4-417e-8217-7513f9292fe0 -->

The directions from the orc laboratory lead to the foothills far west of Etran’s Folly. Here, nestled in the shadow of the Five Kings Mountains, there are countless small valleys and crevasses, but the directions lead to one particular valley: a place called “Spite’s Cradle.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.862,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID a1697942-d586-41dd-b26c-8cede2d97013 -->

Up ahead, a wooden palisade spans the valley; a gigantic double door set into its center. Beyond this wall, a guard tower is barely visible, although it's difficult to tell whether it is occupied. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.124,r=0.454,b=0.191), with ID 9ca5947e-86f1-4d51-a1ac-3f431b112aa6 -->

The PCs can get past the palisade walls in a variety
of ways, but if the orcs spot them and sound an alarm,
things will get much more difficult inside. The wooden
palisade walls are 15 feet high, and the tops are carved
to points. It’s easy to get a grappling hook onto these
walls, but the guards will quickly spot that. The gate
is barred from the inside using three heavy wooden
beams, each of which can be moved with a successful
DC 15 Athletics check. The cliffs that make up the
sides of the valley are steep and 30 feet high, but
not impossible to scale. Climbing the limestone face
requires at least two successful DC 18 Athletics checks
(one to climb up and another to climb down) and a
successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to move across the
crumbling stone without causing a cascade of debris
the guards are likely to notice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.202,r=0.454,b=0.449), with ID b1cded79-5407-4c63-8085-1e7004889f44 -->

The guards in the tower do not have a particularly
good view outside the wall, giving the player characters
an easy approach, but their view of the ground between
the wooden palisades is favorable. The guards generally
look around once every few minutes, and they only
attempt Perception checks against disturbances in the
yard (like a grappling hook or the sudden appearance of
falling rocks). They know they are in a remote location
and don’t expect invasion. PCs that approach from
above have to beat Graytusk’s Perception DC 19 to
approach unnoticed. See area I6 for more information
on what happens if the guards raise the alarm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.449,r=0.454,b=0.633), with ID f73f2ac0-17c2-4455-90da-5bdb5710ad69 -->

12. GUARDED YARD                        TRIVIAL/LOW 3
Beyond the palisade is a well-trodden yard. A small wooden hut is built against the southern rock wall, facing a squat stone fortress. A guard tower stands at the north end of the edifice while a two-story dome anchors the south. The fortress has a brooding look about it, with narrow windows set between heavy pillars of rock. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.642,r=0.454,b=0.788), with ID fb2dd2fe-41f2-45c8-8967-79dfc342975b -->

This area is home to the orcs that serve Vilree.
   Creatures: During the day there are usually two orcs out in the yard relaxing or preparing a meal. This number rises to four at night, when the orcs are most active. In any case, they are not expecting a fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.800,r=0.453,b=0.877), with ID 76407e09-117b-4ae7-864f-da46868daea6 -->

If the alarm has been raised, nine of the 10
orcs are here, including Lord Nar but excluding
Graytusk, who remains in the guard tower. All nine

13. LORD NAR’S THRONE                        LOW 3
A crude leather tarp covers the entrance to this simple wooden hut built against the side of the valley. When the PCs enter, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.245,r=0.819,b=0.313), with ID 66389177-537d-4d4e-b22b-1d4384238915 -->

In the center of this wooden hut is a massive stone throne. Crudely carved with howling orc faces, the chair is clearly intended to intimidate. Flanking it on the walls of the hut are two massive leather canvases featuring simplistic paintings. On the left is an image of a mountain peak with an orc head howling up at it from a great cavern at the mountain’s heart. On the right is the image of a tall, slender woman with black hair. Her ears suggest she is elven or half-elven. In one hand, she holds a large beaker overflowing with green liquid; in the other, she holds naked fire. At the back wall, you can make out a curtain partly concealing an opening into the cliff face. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.323,r=0.819,b=0.512), with ID 770bbd1c-38a2-4566-a4c9-484c8a089128 -->

This hut and the caves behind it are the lair of the
orcs serving under Vilree’s command; their leader is
Lord Nar, a large, brutish orc. If the alarm has not
been raised, Nar will be seated here on his throne.
He sleeps on it in the mornings and into the early
afternoon, but he is awake all night, venturing
outside only for food or to relieve himself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.523,r=0.819,b=0.632), with ID 6b232642-be15-4765-bce9-07701eb16b84 -->

Lord Nar was made the ruler of the orcs shortly
after Vilree took command of the war band. The
ceremony is still talked about in hushed whispers by
the surviving orcs. The previous chief was asked if he
would submit and, when he refused, Vilree burned
him alive using her powerful alchemy. When the
question was posed again, this time to Nar, he readily
agreed. In the years since, Vilree has addicted all of
the orcs to a mild sedative that makes them easier to
manipulate; if the PCs drink from any of the water
sources here or in the caves, they will taste something
odd, but it takes weeks of constant exposure for this
sedative to have any lasting effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.632,r=0.819,b=0.832), with ID 8071aab1-4b93-416e-b925-c12d60e141f9 -->

**Creature:** Nar is a corpulent orc, having grown fat off the luxury of being Vilree’s chosen. While the other orcs resent him, they are too afraid of Vilree’s power to test her decisions. Nar, for his part, plays up the importance of his role in the war band. He visits Vilree once a week to update her, and while these meetings are usually dull except for the occasional order, Nar likes <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.832,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID fccc47ae-f6e0-4994-9e97-94d7b75c05a8 -->

to pretend that she is taking his counsel. If threatened
by the heroes, Nar explains that harming him will
incur the lady’s wrath and that the PCs had best just
surrender to him if they know what is good for them.
    In any event, Nar is not above attacking the
PCs and calling on all his orcs to do the same. The
memory of his predecessor’s screams spurs him to
take almost any risk to avoid failure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.124,r=0.526,b=0.250), with ID 33b713b9-8f59-4f2f-bf27-99be21d01db3 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a large, green-skinned humanoid creature named "Lord Nar," depicted in a primitive, fur-lined outfit and wielding a large wooden club.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a large, green-skinned humanoid with pointed ears and a robust build.
  • The figure is dressed in a patchwork tunic and pants made of rough, stitched-together animal hides and fur.
  • The subject holds a massive wooden club with carved details and carries a stone axe at the waist.
  • The name "Lord Nar" is displayed on a label at the figure’s feet.
  • The background is plain white, focusing attention on the character.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses earthy tones: greens for skin, browns and yellows for clothing, and wood.
  • The style is detailed and painterly, typical of fantasy role-playing game art.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The figure is centered, occupying most of the frame.
  • The club is held diagonally across the body, with the left hand gripping it near the top and the right hand near the bottom.
  • The feet are planted firmly, suggesting a grounded, imposing stance.

Analysis :
  • The visual message conveys strength, primal authority, and a connection to nature, fitting the archetype of a fantasy giant or ogre chieftain.
  • The name "Lord Nar" and the character’s attire suggest a leadership role within a tribal or wilderness setting. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.378,r=0.546,b=0.952), with ID be6d7163-979f-43a6-b89d-f74d7a333b85 -->

Rage ◆ Lord Nar flies into a rage that lasts 1 minute and grants him 8 temporary Hit Points, 4 additional damage with his listed attacks, and a –1 penalty to AC. He cannot use actions that have the concentrate trait while raging, unless they also have the rage trait. Once his rage ends, Nar cannot Rage again for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.341,r=0.887,b=0.434), with ID 7ca129d0-d7ae-4f9c-961f-274acc59af15 -->

Rewards: A bronze key hangs from a leather cord around Nar’s neck; this unlocks the doors to Spite’s Cradle in area I5. Set into the seat of Nar’s throne is a hidden compartment containing the war band’s riches. It can be opened by simultaneously pressing a pair of buttons disguised as orc eyes in the throne’s decorative carving. Inside the compartment is a bag containing 28 gp in silver and copper pieces, a flawed sapphire worth 20 gp, a scroll of heal (2nd level), a scroll of sound burst, and a scroll of restoration. The scrolls belonged to the war band’s shaman, who tried to leave soon after Vilree arrived but, unbeknownst to Nar, Vilree captured her and used her to create the Amalgam (see area I16). Finally, the compartment contains a tiny straw doll made to look like Vilree that Nar keeps here to practice talking to his mistress. It even has hairs collected from her comb that he has lovingly placed on its head. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.449,r=0.892,b=0.755), with ID e4de262d-37f1-47b2-9afd-ddfa1f3e39ae -->

14. SLEEPING CAVES                LOW/MODERATE 3

The cave opening reveals a connected pair of cramped chambers that stink of sweat and campfire smoke. The floor is covered in debris and piles of filth. Almost a dozen sleeping mats are nestled in nooks and built into the walls throughout this space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.766,r=0.891,b=0.879), with ID 35eb04aa-eef2-4831-a776-c17ed2ab6cea -->

The orcs use these two caves as their home; unless  
the alarm has been raised, this chamber usually has  
a few orcs in it at all times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.892,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID 8f78157b-db1e-4c4b-8acb-d90b6b3fe81d -->

**Creatures:** A total of eight orcs sleep in these chambers, although there is space for almost a dozen. Most of the bedrolls on the map actually indicate two nooks, one above and one below, both with sleeping mats and personal effects. During the day, there are usually five orcs here, with two in the yard and one more up in the tower with Graytusk. At night the number drops to just three, with four in the yard and a different orc up in the tower with Graytusk. If a fight breaks out in area 14, the orcs here will come to investigate during the second round of combat, using the first round to gather their weapons, entering the throne room singly or in pairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.327), with ID fe00d298-1889-4c9f-bf36-e19af22a884a -->

**Rewards:** The orcs do not have much of value, but there are a few things of interest to be found here. Scattered among the nooks is 37 sp, 52 cp, and a lot of damaged or shoddy common items (such as ropes, whetstones, backpacks, and candles). If the PCs are looking for something in particular, there is a 50% chance they can find it so long as the item is not magical and has a value of 5 sp or less. Anyone searching the caves can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to find a small cache located under a rock beneath a bedroll. This cache contains an *invisibility potion* and a silver key (worth 1 gp) that unlocks the door to area **I8**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.402,r=0.454,b=0.588), with ID 9fafe4d5-f0e6-4821-a007-7f241ca662a6 -->

15. Reception Hall                        Moderate 3
The large double door leading into Spite’s Cradle are made from heavy wooden planks reinforced with iron bands. They are locked from the inside with an average quality lock, but can be opened with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks or by using the bronze key that Lord Nar wears around his neck. The doors are emblazoned with the image of a small village in flames. This is clearly based on the image on the doors leading to the Sculptor’s chambers in the Pen, but it is more refined and was made by a more practiced hand.
     Once the PCs find a way inside, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.598,r=0.454,b=0.802), with ID 2ac1dd1c-7152-496d-8df8-1f0867dfcc04 -->

The doors swing wide to reveal a small reception hall. A worn carpet stretches from the doors to another double door across the way. To the right is a curved wall with a map of the nearby area painted on it. Spite’s Cradle is in the center, with lines drawn to all of the nearby major settlements and noting travel times by horse. Where Etran’s Folly should be, there is only a simple legend that reads “Ruins of Plaguestone.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.814,r=0.454,b=0.943), with ID 91b2e8c1-ebd6-46a1-91d2-5afb92bb2174 -->

The map gives only the broadest
implication of Vilree’s plans. After
destroying Etran’s Folly, she plans to slowly
build a web of domination over the region using
alchemical drugs and coercion to establish a
hidden empire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.125,r=0.784,b=0.218), with ID bbdefc33-1ed7-4aba-96a7-753972fcc5ff -->

**Creatures:** Two years ago, when Vilree was first experimenting with energy mutagens, she paid a hedge mage to bind a pair of minor air elementals to her service so that she could learn more about the elemental forces. After her research took her elsewhere, she placed the elementals here to serve as guardians, ordering them to attack anyone who enters the room who does not belong. Once the PCs enter, the wind suddenly picks up as the elemental takes shape and attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.220,r=0.820,b=0.374), with ID 0b026340-2d3c-4d23-9254-9b6d9d23a5ed -->

16. GUARD TOWER                                    LOW 3  
This tower actually consists of two locations: the tower’s interior and its covered rooftop. The area shown on the map is the interior. The rooftop area’s only noteworthy features are a hatch granting access to the tower interior via a ladder and a bucket with 100 arrows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.443,r=0.822,b=0.555), with ID 23b47470-b460-40c6-80dc-4ffbebbdf478 -->

**Creatures:** There are always two orcs in this location. One is an ordinary guard, from among those who dwell with Lord Nar. The other is Graytusk, the only capable hunter and tracker among the orcs. Unless she is out on the hunt, Graytusk spends all her time in the tower, either watching from the rooftop or getting a few hours of sleep in the interior room. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.821,b=0.678), with ID c3ab699a-ad0c-4f38-839a-b886f30f8410 -->

As noted in area 11, the primary job of the orcs here
is to watch the yard. The orcs attempt Perception
checks against anyone in the yard every few minutes,
increasing to every round if there is a disturbance
(such as falling rocks or a grappling hook thrown
over the wall). If the orcs spot anything, their first
action is to sound an alarm, alerting Nar and the
other orcs that there’s trouble. Within a few rounds,
all of the orcs are roused and in the yard. They
remain this way for at least 30 minutes while they
try to figure out what’s going on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.678,r=0.820,b=0.847), with ID 77a57550-022d-44f7-9042-920408db8585 -->

In combat, the orc brute descends to area 12 using the stairs on the side of the tower. Graytusk stays here on the rooftop area, raining down arrows upon any intruder she sees. With 40 arrows in her quiver and 100 arrows in the bucket, she’ll be able to sustain that routine for quite a while. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.848,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID 51965a96-08ac-46a2-8da5-18c8a98f152f -->

17. The Study  
This chamber is a small study. To the north, a staircase ascends to a double door; to the south, a stone door is set into the curved wall of the fortresses’ structure.

Opposite the entrance is a bookshelf filled with alchemical lore. Over the years, Vilree has acquired quite the library of esoteric alchemical knowledge.

that includes all of Vilree’s business dealings over
the years, including all of the deals with Bort. While
most of these dealings were ordinary in nature,
she did place orders for large amounts of certain
reagents. In the past year in particular, her orders
got larger and larger, including a number of vile-
sounding reagents such as corpse blood, essence
of bile, and fester root. Anyone who succeeds at a
DC 18 Crafting check can identify these as reagents
used in poisons and diseases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.279), with ID a1c430c1-c3d4-45ed-a2e2-42ba855f19a0 -->

that was one of Vilree’s first experimental
servants. While successful, the experiment
proved too costly and time consuming to be

to instead focus on subjugating the orcs and
mutating other creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.128,r=0.783,b=0.218), with ID df592c4f-52ac-4504-ac8b-0113ef72ca96 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a small, bat-like creature named Pergy, holding a wooden spoon, accompanied by descriptive text about its behavior in a role-playing game scenario.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a small, bloated, bat-winged creature (Pergy) holding a large wooden spoon.
  • The creature is depicted in a cartoonish, whimsical style, with exaggerated features and a friendly demeanor.

  • The image is accompanied by a block of text describing Pergy's actions and reactions when player characters (PCs) enter the room.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement references are present.
  • The illustration is integrated with the text, which provides context for the creature's role in the game.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Pergy is positioned on the left side of the image, facing right, with its wings partially extended.
  • The wooden spoon is held in the foreground, emphasizing its role in the described cooking activity.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually reinforces the descriptive text, helping players or readers imagine the encounter with Pergy.
  • The whimsical style and exaggerated features suggest a lighthearted or comedic tone for the encounter. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.219,r=0.821,b=0.449), with ID 1c02b97e-e0e9-4811-b434-88be99a68c15 -->

There are a
handful of diaries
here from when Vilree
was young; they detail
the years after her mother,
Silwyth’s, death, when she tried
to survive in a town that shunned
her. The diaries end on the five-year
anniversary of Silwyth’s death,
when Vilree decided to leave
the town. She mentions that she found
a new place to live and learn about her
mother’s work: a series of caves
deep in the forest north of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.282,r=0.376,b=0.493), with ID ff1e55fd-19ad-43fb-9eba-f86c352b66c3 -->

If the characters spend  
any time going through the  
personal belongings, they  
undoubtedly hear a racket  
coming from the kitchen (area  
19); the noise is made by Vilree’s  
homunculus as it attempts to cook.

Rewards: Among the curios and mementos on the shelves is a silver locket that contains a small painting of young Vilree. The locket is worth 5 gp. In addition, there is a hand of the mage on one of the shelves, grasping a vial of lesser bravo’s brew. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.603,r=0.453,b=0.678), with ID 40b75cc4-5369-4c02-8eb8-ce0aa5790ae4 -->

19. KITCHEN

Dirty pots and pans are piled high on the table in the center of this room, obscuring the view of the fireplace that sits beyond. Something in this kitchen is making a terrible racket; it sounds like a wooden spoon clattering against an iron pot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.691,r=0.451,b=0.802), with ID 42bc01a1-192a-4bc8-8192-9b37a4c8dbea -->

This kitchen is where Vilree prepares meals, but when she is busy, she allows her homunculus servant to attempt to cook. Unfortunately, the homunculus is a terrible cook, rarely making anything remotely edible. There is not much of value, but the PCs can get food and a wide variety of exotic spices worth a total of 2 gp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.817,r=0.451,b=0.922), with ID c8617217-7689-4db2-952a-d3f3e5588b2a -->

110. THE LADY’S HALL  
The stairs ascend to a small hall that leads to Vilree’s personal chambers. The curved wall of the fortress here is covered in paintings of Vilree’s mother, Silwyth, painted by Vilree to remind herself of all that she has lost. The paintings depict an elven woman of unnatural beauty, with raven hair, fully green eyes, and a mischievous smile dancing across her lips. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.522,r=0.818,b=0.662), with ID d30142b7-a87d-44c3-b531-2c4f234bfa8a -->

The door leading into Vilree’s chambers is both
trapped and locked. It can be opened with the key
Vilree keeps on her person or with three successful DC
20 Thievery skill checks. Opening the door without
using the key triggers the trap (see Hazard below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.664,r=0.818,b=0.739), with ID 309d0f6f-06a2-486f-aa35-5de9d5ca7582 -->

**Hazard:** Vilree has created a dangerous trap in this area to punish anyone foolish enough to violate her private sanctum. If anyone tries to open the door without first using the key, small compartments open in the ceiling, drenching the room with a freezing alchemical solution. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.741,r=0.818,b=0.831), with ID f7cb7857-d5e0-4714-9c6f-35d40989e2f7 -->

### 11. Vilree’s Chambers

The doors open to reveal a bedchamber with a large bed opposite the door, flanked by a desk and a dresser. The heady scent of lilac hangs heavy in the air, emanating from a cone of incense that is still smoking faintly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.275,r=0.525,b=0.375), with ID a211bebc-2645-44a4-836a-a1a7f0e4d5ac -->

Vilree uses this chamber as her sleeping quarters,
but she hasn’t used it much over the past few weeks.
It contains her bed, a dresser filled with robes and
work aprons, a desk filled with personal effects and
correspondence, and a chest (detailed in Rewards
below). A door in the corner leads to the privy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.386,r=0.525,b=0.479), with ID 8597795a-cb3b-46a7-97c2-bafc1a7df8b8 -->

If the PCs spend at least 10 minutes looking
through the correspondence, they find Hallod’s
letters confirming the delivery of various shipments
of alchemical reagents. Another piece of parchment
contains a timeline of dates and notable occurrences;
near the bottom, it shows the date that Bort’s caravan
arrived in town with the note “Tied up loose end:
merchant.” There are two entries beneath that line:
one is dated yesterday, and reads, “The last reaction is
in place.” The final entry does not have a date listed—
that spot is blank—but it reads, “Mother avenged.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.479,r=0.524,b=0.647), with ID 9b13d7fb-fd2f-49a9-a570-323351b8b773 -->

**Rewards:** While the clothes in the dresser are of good make, they are not particularly valuable. One of the drawers contains a mistform elixir and two lesser elixirs of life. The chest in the corner is closed but not locked. Inside are three sacks containing a large amount of coin (53 gp, 86 sp, 416 cp) Vilree earned selling alchemical elixirs to merchants over the years. There are also four moderate alchemist’s fire, two lesser tanglefoot bags, and a moderate fire energy mutagen (page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.648,r=0.525,b=0.802), with ID adae8a99-1bbe-4b4f-bfc0-ea089e35d4a6 -->

112. SILWYTH’S SHRINE                MODERATE 3

Standing at one end of this long chamber is a marble statue of an elven woman holding a flask. She is dressed in a flowing gown, and liquid tears streak down her cheeks into a small pool surrounding the statue’s base. Other than the faint burbling of water, this chamber is peaceful and still. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.812,r=0.525,b=0.942), with ID 6a44d62a-ebd5-4e1b-b68b-d60490a6cdb6 -->

Years after building a home here, Vilree hired an
artisan in Almas to sculpt a statue of her mother.
She had it shipped in secret and installed in this
room so Vilree would have a place where she could
go and remember the woman who tried to save the
folk of Etran’s Folly, was branded a witch, and cast
out. The statue serves as both a reminder and a
warning: never count on others for aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.891,b=0.248), with ID a579964e-8ab7-45a1-99e5-08e7cefc59d6 -->

At the bottom of the pool is a sealed stone box that bears the alchemical symbol for life alongside Silwyth’s name. The box contains her remains, which Vilree brought here shortly after the shrine was completed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.249,r=0.891,b=0.310), with ID 8bed07b1-2092-4cd3-a01b-e56babb970f4 -->

**Creatures:** The pool and fountain in this room are powered by a pair of brine sharks that Vilree bound years ago. These elementals live in the pool and come out only if someone other than Vilree tries to approach the statue, whereupon the pool suddenly surges onto the ground as the elementals take form and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.312,r=0.891,b=0.402), with ID a17f093d-d62c-497d-996e-74ac97ff6ae8 -->

113. Storage  
This chamber is piled high with boxes, barrels, and crates. While most are partially empty, they do contain a wide variety of alchemical tools, reagents, and supplies that could be used to create a vast array of alchemical items. If the PCs could find a way to transport all of this, the reagents alone would allow for the creation of 50 gp worth of alchemical items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.476,r=0.890,b=0.602), with ID 4e033906-8c0b-4ab9-8a4c-07a6cd5f05ed -->

I14. MAIN LABORATORY                        SEVERE 3

The doors open into a long chamber packed full of alchemical gear and experiments. Cauldrons stand next to tables where even now volatile mixtures are brewing and bubbling. A large furnace is opposite the door, just behind a long pool of water with a statue of a woman standing at its head. To the east, a passageway reveals a set of descending spiral stairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.614,r=0.890,b=0.754), with ID 8a1733ab-d53f-4d3e-9db4-59794df21043 -->

This is the laboratory where Vilree does most of the
work that funds her nefarious plans. It is here that
she makes all sorts of elixirs, tools, and bombs to be
sold in Andoran, Cheliax, Isger, and beyond. After
all, her ambitions far outpace those of an ordinary
practitioner of alchemy. Vilree plans to make a name

PCs arrive, but the flasks are still carefully filtering
reagents and are far from ready. The furnace is lit
and is being used to melt copper, burning away
impurities for a future experiment. Finally, the pool
is used as a fresh water supply and is drawn from
a well upstream from the spot where Vilree dumps
waste into the depths. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.234), with ID 288d7392-0558-451a-b4b9-7682e3735715 -->

The statue standing over the pool is of Vilree; she
stands in the same pose as her mother in area 112,
only she does not have tears streaming down her
cheeks. Instead, her expression is hard, cold, and
calculating. The stairs to the east descend to area 115. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.235,r=0.452,b=0.310), with ID 4c814133-1322-4fb3-ae2a-b8a0398ef535 -->

**Creatures:** Vilree long ago realized that she couldn’t trust anyone with her most delicate work. Orcs might be good for testing mutagens and holding prisoners, but they lack the common sense and caution necessary to work in a laboratory. To this end, she experimented to create larger, smarter, and more capable alchemical servants. After a year of research, the first alchemical drudge was created. Appearing like large, wingless homonculi, four such creatures occupy this laboratory, overseeing basic tasks like tending an ongoing experiment or keeping the place tidy. They have strict orders to attack anyone who enters unaccompanied by Vilree. Each is loaded with a different bomb type for its alchemical strike, dealing acid, cold, fire, and electricity respectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.311,r=0.452,b=0.540), with ID 192dcf68-95c2-4dda-b16c-ea39b28d3145 -->

Str +2, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +2, Wis +0, Cha –2
Empathy Link (arcane, divination, mental) An alchemical drudge can’t speak, but its mind is linked to its creator. It can share basic emotional information with its creator, such as fear, happiness, or anger. If the drudge is destroyed, its master automatically knows this. The range of this link is 1,500 feet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.552,r=0.452,b=0.738), with ID 722b7c86-5920-4df0-809f-9ef3a91f2121 -->

**Alchemical Strike** An alchemical drudge contains a special reservoir that can be loaded with the contents of one alchemical bomb that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, allowing the drudge to imbue its fist attacks with this damage. Each hit deals <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.863,r=0.450,b=0.940), with ID d0c3abc8-36d4-4d6e-a482-a244cc20677c -->

1d6 points of damage of the same type as
that of the bomb loaded into it. Each bomb
has enough fluid in it for 10 successful strikes.
Vomit Alchemy  An alchemical drudge can
vomit forth a pool of caustic alchemical
reagents, filling the ground in one square
adjacent to the drudge. Creatures in that square when
the pool is created take 2d6 acid damage (DC 17 basic
Reflex save). Any creature that ends its turn in a
square containing a pool takes 2d6 acid damage. The
pool remains for 1 minute before becoming inert. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.125,r=0.814,b=0.297), with ID da8b4037-0df0-4238-a1e9-de039e271560 -->

**Rewards:** The central table contains common alchemical items ready to be shipped. Chief among them is a small crate containing 6 vials of lesser alchemist’s fire and another with 4 lesser acid flasks. There is also a small, velvet-lined box containing a single dose of lesser stone body mutagen (page 56). A note on the table indicates these items are intended for an address in the Chelish capital of Egorian. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.311,r=0.819,b=0.434), with ID fddb9cd4-1f3f-4705-baf7-6fd5ccd82857 -->

15. Gallery

The spiral stairs from the laboratory descend fifty feet before ending in a narrow hallway. To one side, more stairs descend further to an iron door, while the hallway continues south to a simple wooden door. Along the wall is a carving of a small farming village surrounded by an immense graveyard. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.445,r=0.819,b=0.573), with ID b35b1eba-711d-441d-b9a2-2aa5357393e7 -->

The stairs descend to Vilree’s holding pen (area 116), where she brings prisoners and test subjects for delicate experiments. The door to the pen is barred from this side. The door to the south leads to Vilree’s primary laboratory (area 117), where all of her new formulas were invented. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.586,r=0.817,b=0.678), with ID 900d373c-c754-42f8-9992-c2ffd6c94d27 -->

Screeching open on rusted hinges, the door opens to a room that is quite large, with a ceiling twenty feet above. The north side of the room is divided into three cells by iron bars. To the south is a high platform overlooking the cells. Two of the cells are empty, while the third contains a pitiful mass, huddled in the corner even though its cell door is open. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.690,r=0.819,b=0.831), with ID badd4a57-d7aa-481b-bb85-8c989487fc3d -->

This chamber is used by Vilree to hold subjects for her experiments. The platform is for observing prisoners from above, and it connects to area 117 via a passageway. The cells contain piles of sweat-soaked straw, scraps of fur, a few scales, and other signs that creatures have been held here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.847,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 390ab938-51a7-49fc-a309-06f77ffbacf6 -->

**Creature:** Successful experiments are sent out to be used by other minions, but failures are fused into a horrible, pitiful thing known only as the Amalgam and which functions as the jailor here. Vilree captured the orc war band's shaman as she tried to escape, and then used a powerful mutagenic extract to fuse the poor orc with a hobgoblin. Today, the Amalgam is made up of over a dozen creatures and is recognizable only as a mass of flesh and limbs. In nightmarish pain, the Amalgam's only release is to obey Vilree, who occasionally gives the thing a painkilling elixir. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.127,r=0.526,b=0.296), with ID 31261fbb-4ee1-4637-9713-cdba74b7e570 -->

The Amalgam does not notice the PCs until they

Vilree left the room while creating two doses of energy mutagen (page 56). Her formula book is open on the central table next to the bubbling concoction (see Rewards below). This project takes up only a small corner of the large table, which is otherwise empty. The alchemy tools here are all tainted with an oily green residue. By consulting the formula book and inspecting the available ingredients, a PC can attempt a DC 22 Crafting check to identify this residue as a side effect of the viridian vapor. The book describes an absolutely lethal disease contracted by inhaling the vapor. The disease causes a horrific fungus to grow in the lungs within hours, leading to death. The books do not describe a cure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.125,r=0.455,b=0.341), with ID 77df3fca-aed7-463b-be8d-f3f2848b34c1 -->

Clever PCs might compare the ingredients and
reagents that Bort supplied with the formulas in the
book. It takes 10 minutes to find the right information,
but one thing becomes abundantly clear: Vilree had
enough ingredients to create 500 batches of viridian
vapor. Worse, none of those ingredients can be found
here in the laboratory in any quantity, although there
are a number of empty containers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.342,r=0.454,b=0.464), with ID 1b4a1df5-fb20-49b5-9d75-58070e36545c -->

A parchment tucked inside the formula book bears a simple diagram of a round, flat-topped rock with a depression on top. The diagram depicts a procedure for using acid to create a reservoir inside the stone. There is only one note on the illustration, reading “Mother’s ring will be the key.” The PCs may not realize it at first, but this diagram depicts the plaguestone in the center of Etran’s Folly. Over the past few months, Vilree has hollowed out the stone and secretly filled it with viridian vapor. Her plan is to destroy the stone using her mother’s ring, which she has had enchanted to explosively shatter the stone when it comes into contact with the ring. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.465,r=0.453,b=0.678), with ID 44bbaca8-763f-4143-b6a6-5486c619b44c -->

The tall glass cylinder at the west end of the room contains the remains of a dwarf, Vilree’s most recent test subject. To ensure the viridian vapor was suitably lethal, she had her orcs venture deep into the mountains and capture the first humanoid they encountered. The unfortunate dwarf was on his way home from visiting relatives when the orcs set upon him. He died in this chamber a few days later, and his skin split open as the fungus inside him consumed his flesh. Worse still, the vapor is still swirling around his body and his rotting flesh can now transmit the disease. A successful DC 20 Medicine check by a PC who has read Vilree’s formula book confirms that these are effects of the viridian vapor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.679,r=0.452,b=0.892), with ID 0112663b-75e7-442b-825f-606b5051a5ce -->

anything from the table. Two alchemical

**Rewards:** There are a number of valuable alchemical items in this room. Vilree’s gear could easily be plundered to create a set of alchemist’s tools, and the reagents present are enough to craft 80 gp worth of alchemical items. There are also a number of finished items here: 3 minor elixirs of life, 2 lesser elixirs of life, 2 lesser alchemist’s fire, 4 lesser acid flasks, 2 lesser tanglefoot bags, 2 lesser frost vials, a lesser cognitive mutagen, a lesser stone body mutagen, and a moderate electricity energy mutagen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.372,r=0.818,b=0.525), with ID a8961dd0-44f5-47ee-afb2-118e3f704af1 -->

But the real treasure here is the formula book on the table. It contains a wide variety of formulas, including all of the items found in this adventure (acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bomber’s eye elixir, bottled lightning, bravo’s brew, cat’s eye elixir, elixirs of life, liquid ice, mistform elixir, tanglefoot bags, and of course, the viridian vapor). It also includes formulas for energy and stone body mutagens (page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.526,r=0.818,b=0.648), with ID 749de41c-29c0-4ac0-b0ac-f4e6598899dc -->

118. The Descent

The stairs descend into a rough-hewn chamber, the far side of which looks like a natural cave. In the southeast corner, a passageway winds off into darkness. A sputtering torch is mounted next to the door. In the distance, you can hear the sound of rushing water. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.659,r=0.819,b=0.772), with ID 5e0359b6-4de2-4113-8ae0-27c2f10c9f70 -->

These caves are the reason Vilree moved her laboratory here. As the PCs get closer to the cave walls, the character with the highest Perception notices veins of green in the rock. This ore is a key ingredient in the creation of the viridian vapor, and part of the reason it is so deadly. When ground up, the green rock deals serious damage to the lungs, allowing an infection to take hold and grow within hours. If the characters have studied Vilree’s formula book, they know this green rock is called flaystone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.659,r=0.819,b=0.940), with ID 33a9b656-f894-4ce3-9dab-61376fb7de1e -->

The twisting corridor opens into a large cavern filled with large, glistening stalactites and stalagmites. Puddles of brackish water dot the floor, and while the sound of rushing water seems to be close by, the source is not in this room. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.121,r=0.525,b=0.237), with ID da872db2-6bc6-4704-b1ac-377205d367ea -->

This cavern was too cramped for Vilree’s use, but a number of paths have been opened through the chamber, allowing characters to easily move through it.

**Creatures:** Vilree is careful not to make too much noise when passing through this chamber, but the PCs have no idea that the room is inhabited by a large number of bats that swarm at the slightest provocation. The swarm tends to move, use Blood Feast, and then move again, while the giant bat picks a target and attacks until slain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.248,r=0.525,b=0.403), with ID 0dfdeeff-e161-4d75-9180-3ec48bc06624 -->

  • The main subject is a large, humanoid monster with exaggerated, deformed features.
  • The creature has oversized hands and feet, a distended belly, and a head with a single large eye and a gaping mouth full of sharp teeth.
  • Its skin appears stitched together in multiple places, suggesting it is a patchwork or constructed being.
  • The monster has small, bat-like wings protruding from its back.
  • The color palette is dominated by fleshy tones, with reddish highlights on the wings and mouth.
  • The label "The Behemoth" is placed near its feet, on a green plaque.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is rendered with detailed shading and texture to emphasize the creature's grotesque anatomy.
  • The number "46" appears in green in the lower left corner, possibly a page or figure number.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature is centrally positioned, facing slightly to the right.
  • Its large hands and feet are in the foreground, with the wings and head forming the upper background.
  • The label "The Behemoth" is placed in the lower center, partially overlapping the creature's left foot.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the monstrous and unnatural qualities of "The Behemoth" through exaggerated anatomy, stitched skin, and a menacing facial expression.
  • The presence of wings and patchwork body parts suggests a creature assembled from various sources, fitting a fantasy or horror context.
  • The label and numbering indicate this is likely part of a larger collection or compendium of monsters. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.052,t=0.559,r=0.548,b=0.953), with ID f68b3aab-3308-446f-bab7-bb99febd878f -->

120. THE EMERALD DEPTHS                SEVERE 3

The winding passage ends in a large cavernous chamber. Running through the middle is an underground river rushing from east to west. A narrow bridge crosses the water; it looks slick with moisture and mold. On the far side of the chamber are immense formations of cloudy, green rock, and in front of them is a large black cauldron with a fire burning at its base. Light filters into this chamber from above through a twisting crevasse in the ceiling; the far side of the cavern is lit by glowing green orbs suspended by chains from stalactites. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.122,r=0.891,b=0.311), with ID d90e016f-0ebb-47a5-8510-02731c2065ce -->

It was here that Vilree did much of the work to make the viridian vapor, starting with a thick solution of powdered flaystone. And it is here that Vilree waits for intruders. She likely received warning from the alchemical drudges that the PCs were drawing closer, and she is ready for them. When the PCs are all in the room, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.326,r=0.891,b=0.449), with ID a4c447ea-a110-4e66-b4d7-2b2f756bbbf7 -->

Stepping out from behind the massive cauldron is a thin woman, gently pointed ears rising up from her oily, raven-black hair. She is wearing stitched leathers bearing countless pouches and pockets filled with glass vials. She looks at you with a sneer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.463,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 0f6160b4-1ff2-47b9-be4f-f1177472fe65 -->

“So, you must be the fools that arrived with Bort. Sorry about your *friend*,” she says, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “I couldn’t let anyone piece together what had happened here, and he knew too much. I am sure you think you can stop me and save the town. You shouldn’t have bothered. They are a wicked, worthless lot and don’t deserve compassion. How could they, when they let their own suffer and die in agony? Scorning a child out of spite?” As she says the words, she looks at each of you in turn. “Leave now and never look back. No one need ever know you were here.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.541,r=0.890,b=0.710), with ID 4b2e0dc3-9042-48e4-a847-a7a803a81ae1 -->

It’s unlikely the characters will take Vilree up on her offer, but if they leave, she lets them. Assuming they don’t, she says only “Pity,” which is the command word for her greatest alchemical servant, the Behemoth, to rise up out of the water and hold the bridge between Vilree and the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.724,r=0.890,b=0.815), with ID 6086ee41-9278-4dff-9dcf-e6476dd23219 -->

**Creatures:** Vilree and the Behemoth should make for a very dangerous encounter. The Behemoth’s sole job is to prevent anyone from getting across the bridge, while Vilree remains on the far side, lobbing bombs and firing her alchemical crossbow at the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.555,t=0.817,r=0.890,b=0.892), with ID 20b548fe-333e-4ba7-b918-d7c6ab3ca232 -->

Depending on how the fight goes with the
Behemoth, someone could get knocked into the
water. This water flows quickly from east to west <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.893,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID 58ecd0d6-2ba8-40db-90ae-0b5e11ecd39a -->

and, should anyone be swept out of the room, they
have almost no chance of surviving (the river enters
another underground cave about a half a mile from
here, and finding a way back to surface is another
adventure entirely). Swimming against the current
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check, but
the DC drops to 16 if the character swims with the
current or swims directly to the nearest edge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.127,r=0.453,b=0.248), with ID b68d097b-b309-4d8b-a8aa-818d672ddcc2 -->

If the PCs take down the Behemoth and engage her in melee, Vilree drinks her moderate acid energy mutagen and draws her blade. She otherwise fights cautiously, using her crossbow and bombs, as well as elixirs of life to heal serious wounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.249,r=0.454,b=0.327), with ID 8636e2d6-1cd7-4eb6-bd69-4ae1c5f1535f -->

**Alchemical Crossbow** Vilree’s crossbow can deliver bolts that are alchemically infused. As an action, she can slot an alchemical bomb into the crossbow, and the next 3 attacks she makes with it deal 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the bomb. These attacks never deal splash damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.125,r=0.513,b=0.219), with ID 3588fa1b-44e1-40a8-80ef-85fec40531ba -->

Alchemy Vilree has used her alchemy ability to create 4 moderate acid flasks, 6 moderate alchemist’s fire, 2 moderate bottled lightnings, 3 lesser elixirs of life, and 2 lesser tanglefoot bags. These are infusions. She can spend an action to create an additional vial of any one of these items, or any of the items listed as formulas in her book. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.219,r=0.518,b=0.325), with ID ee6badde-3ac9-46f4-bf06-4812e5c806a1 -->

**Far Lob** Vilree's bombs have a range increment of 30 feet.  
**Quick Bomber** ![inline figure: black diamond icon] Vilree can interact to draw a bomb and then make a Strike with it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.326,r=0.523,b=0.372), with ID 23f34ea4-294c-4b2b-997c-0870e2908de5 -->

Last Threat: Vilree is confident of victory, but if things turn against her she has one final ploy. When she’s reduced to fewer than half her total Hit Points, on her next turn, read or paraphrase the following. (This might also be adapted as she lies dying.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.387,r=0.524,b=0.463), with ID 5ebc7f35-1f02-432b-945b-504f428eeb2a -->

**Reward:** The key she carries opens any lock in Spite’s Cradle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.464,r=0.524,b=0.494), with ID e2651de5-2e11-4f62-af75-4c97a4cfd9a8 -->

XP Award: Defeating Vilree is a major milestone
for the characters. Reward them 80 XP for
completing this critical part of the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.495,r=0.523,b=0.540), with ID f870fabf-2406-40ac-965a-7d7fbdd3a22d -->

Vilree looks at you with contempt. “It doesn’t matter, you know. I’ve already won. I dispatched my minion to destroy the town just before you arrived here. Everyone in Plaguestone will be dead long before you ever get there!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.554,r=0.523,b=0.633), with ID 551b6cb4-52ca-407a-8193-e5dc661b4f93 -->

Vilree sent an alchemical drudge to the town
shortly after the PCs arrived at her laboratory (or
about an hour ago, if the PCs took their time). The
drudge exited the chamber by climbing up and out
through the crevasse in the ceiling that provides light
to this chamber. The drudge is carrying Silwyth’s ring,
which has been enchanted so that, if it touches the
plaguestone, rock and ring will both explode, covering
the town in a growing cloud of viridian vapor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.648,r=0.524,b=0.785), with ID 76ad271f-b456-4b5f-af3a-9da965fe7aa1 -->

# RACE TO SAVE ETRAN'S FOLLY
By the time the PCs defeat Vilree, her alchemical drudge has a significant head start in the race back to Etran’s Folly. The PCs have a choice if they want to save the town: they can attempt to track the drudge, or they can race back to town and wait for it at the plaguestone. If the PCs have horses, they won’t have to stop and rest and won’t be fatigued for the final confrontation. If the PCs race back to Etran’s Folly <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.796,r=0.524,b=0.939), with ID 8d83bb87-543f-4fd4-b769-6bf4b9e8967a -->

on horseback, they will beat the drudge by several  
hours, giving them time to prepare an ambush. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.890,b=0.158), with ID bcd7b7a7-2074-4f92-bcb9-ad0853a0e738 -->

Track the Drudge  
If the PCs decide to track the drudge, they must first attempt a DC 20 Survival check to find its trail. This DC is reduced to 15 if they first locate the spot where the crevasse leading out of area I20 reaches the surface, as this is where the drudge first began its journey. Once the trail is discovered, it is relatively easy to follow. The drudge is relentless in completing its task, and it is not subtle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.170,r=0.891,b=0.309), with ID ff0d7e70-3711-482b-8576-abbca7a06310 -->

During the chase, ask the PCs if they are taking any
breaks to rest or if they are simply pushing on despite
growing fatigue. Note this, as it will matter when it
comes to the final confrontation with the drudge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.311,r=0.890,b=0.371), with ID 6290c798-0132-499f-8fda-d2c6cfc16f63 -->

Read or paraphrase the following once the PCs are on the drudge’s trail. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.373,r=0.890,b=0.401), with ID 93e8c7e3-0f27-4bf9-a5a3-28460eb70973 -->

After finding the trail, it is a simple matter to follow the plodding footsteps of Vilree’s minion as it makes its way toward Etran’s Folly. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and the unsuspecting town grows ever closer. Vilree’s alchemical servant never seems to tire, and there is no sign that it ever stops for food or rest, but it does seem the distance is closing. The trail looks more and more recent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.417,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 142cae6a-d4e3-4d09-b358-628c835a6219 -->

Just as Etran's Folly comes into view, so does Vilree's drudge. It is close to the town but with haste it is still possible to catch it before it can complete its grim task! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.541,r=0.890,b=0.587), with ID 090363aa-d0b7-4af4-b210-bce362728786 -->

RACE TO TOWN  
If the PCs race the drudge back to town, they have no idea how fast their competition is traveling to the plaguestone. Although the journey is to the same place, the two divergent paths make it hard to guess who might be in the lead. Ask the PCs if they are taking breaks to rest or are simply pushing on despite growing fatigue. Note this for the confrontation with the drudge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.599,r=0.891,b=0.738), with ID 9b8f4f75-1c97-414f-a46f-2f409266b61c -->

Once the PCs have made their choices, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.741,r=0.890,b=0.770), with ID 2f9483dd-ba32-4c84-9c9a-23c758e9835b -->

There is still a grim possibility that the town of Etran’s Folly is now a town filled with the dead and dying. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and finally the unsuspecting village grows ever closer. There is no sign of Vilree’s minion, but that only adds to a growing sense of dread. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.785,r=0.890,b=0.876), with ID 3574b0a8-3592-4378-902e-aa8b386ebb87 -->

Etran’s Folly comes into view at the crest of a hill.  
The alchemical drudge is now approaching its final destination—the plaguestone—where it will carry out its final gruesome command from Vilree! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.878,r=0.890,b=0.940), with ID 6a431031-8fa3-41e7-a048-3d87f9c0062d -->

Summary : This is a decorative sidebar illustration from a fantasy roleplaying game adventure module, listing the main parts of the adventure and a toolbox section, all framed by a magical, purple, organic border with fantasy alchemical motifs.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a parchment-like vertical panel bordered by twisting, purple, root-like tendrils with glowing orange and yellow highlights.
  • At the top, there is a glass flask containing a yellow liquid, integrated into the border, suggesting an alchemical or magical theme.
  • The parchment lists the following sections: "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder", "Part 2: The Ranger's Request", "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair", and "Adventure Toolbox".
  • At the bottom, a small green vial and a white book or scroll are depicted, further emphasizing the alchemical/fantasy motif.
Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is in a serif font, centered on the parchment.
  • The illustration uses a palette of purples, greens, yellows, and muted browns.
Spatial Relationships :
  • The parchment is vertically oriented, with the border elements wrapping around it.
  • The flask is at the top right, while the vial and book/scroll are at the bottom center.
  • The text is evenly spaced down the center of the parchment.
Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for the adventure, visually reinforcing the magical and alchemical setting. The ornate border and fantasy objects draw attention to the structure of the adventure and set the tone for the content that follows. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.779,t=0.077,r=0.999,b=0.765), with ID 9ae61964-98bf-40a3-b2de-a0a667e83350 -->

STOPPING THE DRUDGE                MODERATE 3
Once the scene is set, all that remains is to defeat the drudge before it can touch the ring to the plaguestone. If the PCs succeed, they will be hailed as heroes, but should they fail, a miasma will spread over the town, spelling the end of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.120,r=0.459,b=0.250), with ID bb5e06c7-9841-4e89-9718-fe7fd0c77ecc -->

Creature: The alchemical drudge relentlessly carries out its final command. Its starting position and distance to the stone depends upon choices the PCs made. If they didn’t stop for breaks, the PCs are all fatigued (unless they have horses, in which case the horses are fatigued instead), but they can square off against the drudge while it is still at the edge of town, 120 feet away from the stone. If the PCs rested, the drudge starts only 60 feet from the stone, near the middle of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.248,r=0.459,b=0.494), with ID f6d70ecb-bbc1-486b-9a7e-1d3ee126192d -->

If the PCs chased the drudge, they are just 30
feet behind it. If they raced to town on foot, they
start at the stone, but the drudge is 30 feet closer

Finally, if the PCs raced back to town on horses,
they arrive 2 hours before the drudge, but they must
stay alert because they don’t know when to expect
the drudge to arrive. They do, however, have the
chance to put up barriers or set an ambush, at your
discretion. At the very least, they start at the stone
and the drudge is 120 feet away, giving them ample
time to stop it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.556,r=0.455,b=0.678), with ID dfa78121-f224-4973-8730-00655d18889d -->

Once combat has begun, the drudge only fights
back if its path is blocked; otherwise, it moves
toward the stone with all its actions, heedless of
danger. Once adjacent to the stone, it must spend
one action to retrieve the ring and three more to
activate it. If it does, the plaguestone explodes,
killing the drudge instantly and dealing 6d6 slashing
damage to everyone within 30 feet (DC 22 basic
Reflex save). In addition, this explosion spreads the
viridian vapor all around town, infecting everyone
as noted in Hazard below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.678,r=0.455,b=0.849), with ID 6bf77a15-80e3-4822-ae1d-f06e5b3d56ca -->

clears the PCs and the members
of Bort’s caravan of Bort’s
murder. Even Sheriff Rolth is
impressed that the strangers
did so much to help the tiny community. Delma
lets them stay at the Feedmill, free of charge,
for as long as they like, and any tab they might
have acquired is wiped away. The PCs are free to
leave and continue their journey to Almas if they
like, but they will have to wait at least a day if
they want to continue traveling with what is now
Tamli’s caravan, as the caravan members want to
give Bort a proper burial. If the PCs decide to train
for a few days with Noala, Tamli and crew are
happy to wait as well, enjoying a little rest before
getting back on the road. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.397,r=0.819,b=0.647), with ID 350b869e-2980-4587-ab10-f62f97696eeb -->

**Rewards:** Tamli invites the PCs to the funeral and gives them all a chance to say a few words, a fond farewell to the caravan master that treated them all amicably. In spite of any shady deals he might have made over the years with questionable characters, he was genuinely kind and fair to his staff and those who rode with him. Tamli sheds more than a few tears as she says goodbye and attempts to make peace with the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.648,r=0.820,b=0.786), with ID 4131cee0-7363-4151-89d6-4a592450d5df -->

After the ceremony, she approaches the PCs to give them a gift. Bort was fond of rings, collecting a variety of them throughout his travels. She wishes to give one ring to each character, and states that many of them are magical.

Summary : This is a digitally illustrated scene of a medieval or fantasy village square, used as a decorative title page for an "Adventure Toolbox" resource.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a quiet, empty village square with cobblestone ground, surrounded by timber-framed buildings with steep roofs and chimneys.
  • The perspective is from street level, looking toward a cluster of buildings; a stone well with a bowl on top is prominent in the foreground.
  • The lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, with warm, soft tones and long shadows.
  • The colour palette is dominated by earthy browns, muted blues, and soft oranges, with green decorative elements framing the image.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.
  • Decorative green vines, leaves, and a large turnip frame the left and bottom edges.
  • The text "ADVENTURE TOOLBOX" is centered at the bottom in a stylized font on a parchment-like banner.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The stone well is in the immediate foreground, slightly right of center.
  • The largest building is on the right, with smaller houses receding into the background on the left.

Not even mentioned on most maps, the town of Etran’s Folly has seen better days. The town’s population has never fully recovered from a plague that struck almost 20 years ago, and many of the homes on the north side of town stand empty and abandoned. In spite of such hardships, the townsfolk carry on and are friendly to outsiders and travelers. Those who approach are sure to marvel at huge turnip fields surrounding the village, but should be wary of the turnip ale favored by the locals—it’s quite strong and it’s definitely an acquired taste. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.651,r=0.900,b=0.929), with ID 04fc220e-ded2-4078-a55e-95c7f05c44a0 -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar or callout box from a fantasy-themed book, listing the main parts of an adventure module and an "Adventure Toolbox" section, all framed by a magical, alchemical motif.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical, ornate frame resembling melted purple wax or magical energy, with embedded stars and a potion flask at the top.
  • The frame encloses a parchment-like area listing adventure parts: "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder", "Part 2: The Ranger's Request", "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair", and "Adventure Toolbox".
  • At the bottom, a small vial with green liquid and sparkles is depicted.
  • The colour palette is dominated by purples, greens, and golds, with a fantasy/magical aesthetic.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is centered within the parchment area, using a serif font.
  • No UI elements or digital overlays are visible.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The illustration is vertically oriented, with the potion flask at the top and the vial at the bottom.
  • The text is stacked in a single column, evenly spaced.

Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for an adventure, using fantasy motifs to enhance immersion and visual appeal. The magical elements and potion imagery reinforce the genre and likely content of the module. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.794,t=0.093,r=1.000,b=0.763), with ID 124f16fa-ed57-4b09-bb3a-45441a38d30a -->

used to be sheep pastures. The path
leads from the north side of town, out
through the fields, to the old shrine,
and back around to the south side
of town, passing by Etran’s Hill.
**Etran’s Hill:** To the southeast
of town is a small hill covered in
old stones and bits of burned debris.
This site was once the home of the
town’s founder, Etran Bolmere, and
his family. They moved to this area
from Taldor, hoping to found a small
community as a stopover for the
overland travel through the region.
Rumor has it he built up on the hill
so that all would see it, despite it
being far away from the nearest
source of fresh water. Just 5
years after founding the town,
the house burned down, killing
Etran and his family, while also giving
the town its current name (it was originally
called Etranton). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.461,t=0.120,r=0.820,b=0.478), with ID 116d0b5c-5de7-48df-87ab-8df79c049f89 -->

This section of this book includes useful tools for running “The Fall of Plaguestone.” In the following pages you’ll find a gazetteer of the town, including brief descriptions of the town’s significant inhabitants. There is also a quick review of the NPC caravan members, new character backgrounds tied to this adventure, rules and rewards found only here, a selection of side quests that link with the new backgrounds, and a few new monsters.

ETRAN’S FOLLY GAZETTEER  
Etran’s Folly is a tiny community of about 300 people, but many of them live on farms or in small homes on the outskirts. It once sported a population nearly double that number, but a plague wiped out a number of families 20 years ago and the community has never fully recovered. Aside from the Feedmill and the ruins up on Etran’s Hill, the buildings in town are of typical wattle-and-daub construction, with thick thatch roofs.

**LOCATIONS AROUND ETRAN'S FOLLY**  
What follows are some of the major sites in the small town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.567,r=0.453,b=0.617), with ID a1221d1a-05c6-4c56-8524-ff45f03e85f5 -->

**Dead Homes:** The homes on the north side of Etran’s Folly are mostly empty these days, and most are in a state of severe disrepair. When the plague hit the town a little less than 20 years ago, this neighborhood saw many casualties and as a result, almost no one lives here today. Those who do call this part of town home are either desperate or are squatters with no official claim to the property. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.618,r=0.453,b=0.740), with ID 2fcd9981-464d-40b8-8e4c-b984e1f35598 -->

**Dead Willow:** On the northwest edge of town, near the river, stands an old dead willow tree in front of a dilapidated home. Though not unlike other nearby homes with overgrown plants and poorly maintained structures, this one is significant because it is the home of Hallod, the town bully and servant of Vilree. This home and the dungeon beneath it are both fully described in the Hallod’s Hideout portion of the adventure, starting on page 15. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.741,r=0.453,b=0.878), with ID b66f4a68-7e9b-497b-a4b5-3920001a4617 -->

**Drunk Shepherd’s Path:** Wandering through the outskirts of town, the Drunk Shepherd’s Path is little more than a meandering foot trail that leads through the nearby turnip farms, many of which <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.878,r=0.453,b=0.941), with ID 48cf0c79-27fe-4acf-ad71-1f6b6e122802 -->

Feedmill: Located in the center of town, the Feedmill is the town’s only inn, tavern, and general store, all crammed into one overcrowded business. Since it happens to be the only place in town with rooms to rent (albeit in the loft above the stables), it is the place where Bort and his caravan stay every time they visit. While the accommodations are far from great, the old straw mattresses are still better than sleeping on the hard earth outside. The food here is passing at best, with much of it focused on the town’s primary crop: turnips. A typical meal here consists of roasted wild game, turnip stew, a slice of dry seedcake, and a sweet turnip porridge for desert. Few desire seconds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.471,r=0.820,b=0.694), with ID ad0569ac-16cf-48ae-8fce-db469e2624d4 -->

The Feedmill is owned by Targen Fulst, the aging
mayor of the town who opened the business over
50 years ago. Targen is far too old and senile to take
part in the day-to-day activities, instead leaving
those to his daughter, Delma Fulst, who also tends
the bar and the till for the general store. The other
employees are Amora Kasillan (cook), Edra Wythe
(stablehand), Kolnral Brannak (server), Phinick
Padley (helper), and Trin Sathern (server). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.694,r=0.820,b=0.833), with ID 3c1cb9a6-50e8-4334-a5de-9211c4a1d7bd -->

Most common items (level 1) can be found in the
general store, but unless they’re items that might be
useful to a farming community, the store has only
one or two in stock. The only magic items they
have on hand are three *minor healing potions* and
a *potency crystal*. No alchemical items are in stock,
and if anyone asks Delma, she simply replies that the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.832,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID 4a347072-e342-4968-8d7a-13f14fd31bf9 -->

Summary : This is a stylized illustrated sidebar or menu listing the three parts of an adventure and an "Adventure Toolbox" section, bordered by a purple, waxy or magical frame, with a potion bottle at the bottom.

Scene Overview :  
  • The main subject is a vertical, scroll-like menu or sidebar with a wooden or parchment texture, bordered by a thick, irregular, purple wax or magical substance.  
  • The sidebar lists:  
    – Part 1: A Mysterious Murder  
    – Part 2: The Ranger's Request  
    – Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair  
    – Adventure Toolbox  
  • At the bottom, there is a small illustrated potion bottle with a greenish liquid, and two small orange sparkles or lights.

Old Shrine: The town once offered
prayers to a number of deities, with
Gozreh chief among them. Most
townspeople ventured out to this
small shrine dedicated to Gozreh
just outside of town, located in a
dell brimming natural beauty. After
the plague took the town’s only
priest, much of the community’s
faith has faded. While most residents
still offer up prayers now and then,
there are no organized services,
and most holy days are
observed only in small,
personal gatherings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.158,r=0.458,b=0.387), with ID 2fba6213-74d4-4861-a225-bcd0864230d6 -->

Today, the old shrine is in the  
process of being reclaimed by the  
wilds. Its standing stones are covered  
with a tangled mass of moss and ivy.  
Worse still, the shrine is now home to a nest  
of four bloodseekers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.388,r=0.476,b=0.479), with ID 6015945c-2bc9-4acb-a124-36da72b36f3a -->

**Plaguestone:** At the height of the plague, the healthy kept their distance from the sick, hoping to stave off infection. As heartless as this might seem, the town did come up with a way to offer aid and succor to the quarantined ill. Just west of the Feedmill, a great stone was used to exchange food and remedies for coin, with the aid being placed on one side and the coins dropped into a depression on the other side that was filled with vinegar to decontaminate them. This plaguestone was the only contact that the ill had with others in town and their loved ones. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.479,r=0.524,b=0.662), with ID a52e8a28-0887-4730-9d63-dccbd4566098 -->

Today, the stone is covered in moss and ivy, a
silent witness to those grim months. The town
folk pay it no heed, which might prove to be their
downfall, as Vilree’s plan to destroy the town uses
this very stone as the implement of her revenge.
Over the past few years, she has slowly hollowed
out the inside of the stone using acid and filled
it with a virulent plague. Anyone inspecting the
stone might notice a crack in the top, but there is
no way for observes to detect the deep reservoir
of alchemical soup that hides within, aside from
destroying the stone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.664,r=0.524,b=0.847), with ID 493af18d-326e-47d0-8af1-3cf95590beec -->

NPCS AROUND TOWN  
The following NPCs can be found in and around  
the town of Etran’s Folly. Unless otherwise noted,  
they are 0-level characters with a +5 bonus to skills  
applicable to their profession. In most cases, they <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.856,r=0.524,b=0.941), with ID ef786d8d-5a45-4f7e-948e-7b6b8c393603 -->

flee or surrender if faced with violence unless their
lives or the lives of their loved ones are in danger.
Each entry contains a brief description of the
NPC and their general attitude. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.126,r=0.890,b=0.187), with ID 7895cde0-0925-4176-89b6-5b2b8657e804 -->

Amora Kasillan (LN female human cook): Amora spends most of her days in the Feedmill’s kitchen. She’s loud and boisterous and can often be heard singing off-key while she works. She is very proud of her cooking, boasting that everything has to be just right, and that she makes the finest meals in Etran’s Folly. She does not allow any substitutions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.599,t=0.188,r=0.892,b=0.325), with ID 350852eb-5af1-4045-826c-4161fdbb1bcd -->

Amora stands at just under 6 feet tall, with short brown hair kept tied tight behind her head. She is rarely seen without an apron on, even at home. Amora’s voice and laughter are as big as she is, and while she is perfectly friendly to guests, she can fly into a fury if anyone criticizes her cooking. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.598,t=0.326,r=0.892,b=0.463), with ID 480b0e75-eeaf-4d21-ad6a-d6993324dce6 -->

**Delma Fulst (NG female human bartender):**
Daughter of mayor Targen Fulst, Delma rung the Feedmill, the town’s only tavern, inn, and general store. Delma has a shrewd eye for business that she learned from her father, but unlike him, she has compassion and empathy for the folks around town. She knows that without the Feedmill, the town would probably fade away, so she does everything in her power to ensure that it is always well stocked and offers up fair prices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.465,r=0.891,b=0.616), with ID 74147713-74da-4607-a086-9c2531b21764 -->

Edra Wythe (NG female halfling stablehand):
Edra works in the stables and barn at the Feedmill. She takes her job seriously—when there actually work to be done. Otherwise she can be found napping in one of the stables, passed out from drinking too much turnip ale. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.618,r=0.890,b=0.708), with ID 52b59295-9177-4365-bc2b-e7cad6d8e91d -->

**Farmer Eallom (CN male human farmer):** Farmer Eallom is the town drunk, and lives in a run-down turnip farm on the edge of town. He spends most nights at the Feedmill getting drunk on turnip ale and a tarry rum-like drink that the locals just call “wagon grease” (also made from turnips). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.710,r=0.889,b=0.800), with ID b70f259c-ef3f-43ed-8b9a-d0f02b4d2f6c -->

Flonk the Bard (CG male half-elf musician):
Flonk is the town’s only source of musical entertainment, not that he is any good, despite decades of practice. His lute is missing two strings, and the self-proclaimed “bard” knows only about a half-dozen songs. He can be found at the Feedmill every night, singing and strumming away—badly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.802,r=0.889,b=0.907), with ID 0773b62e-a138-4e45-8c25-847ed19c101a -->

crisscrossing his face from years of bar fights. He is
one of Vilree’s servants in town, and he is the one
who accepts the shipment from Bort when
the caravan first arrives. Hallod is
also the one who bullies Phinick
into poisoning the merchant. PCs
can find Hallod in the Feedmill
at night or in his shack at the
northern edge of town. Hallod
appears in area F of the adventure,
which starts on page 15. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.454,b=0.295), with ID 2b354722-1b8c-41ce-bf60-ebe960a47a35 -->

little, as most justice in Etran’s Folly is
metered out with crude blades or farm
tools long before he arrives. Rolth’s
only real job is to handle disputes
between farmers over crops
and livestock. Rolth is lazy and
not too bright, and he is so out of
shape that most who want to avoid
his justice need only to run away.
When Bort is murdered, Rolth’s only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.466,t=0.120,r=0.823,b=0.374), with ID 1ba437df-8600-4205-8e95-c5d3468c4622 -->

Kolnral Brannak (NG male human server): Kolnral is one of two servers at the Feedmill, along with Trin Sathern, and is quite skilled at his job. His wife and child also tend to a small plot on the eastern side of town to bolster the family’s income. Kolnral is friendly but not too interested in talking to strangers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.295,r=0.398,b=0.449), with ID 3f4f271c-b218-4836-9389-36cfc91b7282 -->

Noala Kesrir (NG Female Elf Ranger):
Noala came to the region of Etran’s Folly about 10 years ago, settling here after serving as a mercenary in the Goblinblood Wars. Toward the end of that struggle, she was caught inside a burning building during a raid. Her right arm was terribly burned in the fire, making that hand all but useless. As a result, she wears a custom leather gauntlet over her right hand that allows her to fire her bow, but it reduces her accuracy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.449,r=0.455,b=0.602), with ID f70f7da1-93bb-4ce6-9fd7-57eb34921ca9 -->

Noala thinks of herself as a steward of these lands, even though no one else seems to recognize her as such. She is rarely found in town unless needed, instead preferring to work in the wild, preserving the delicate balance in the woodlands around the community. Only Delma seems to recognize and appreciate Noala for all she does for the town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.602,r=0.454,b=0.724), with ID c3c82736-8461-434a-b2fe-751c21b3a150 -->

Phinick Padley (CN male goblin helper):  
Performing all sorts of odd jobs around the Feedmill, Phinick can most often be found helping with inventory in the morning, then transitioning over to help Amora in the kitchen in the afternoon. Phinick is tolerated by the townsfolk, but only barely—a fact that keeps him on edge. The twitchy goblin is rather timid and shy around big folk, trying too hard to fit in. Phinick is bullied into adding a special “spice” to Bort’s food in Part 1 of the adventure, and he quickly goes into hiding after the merchant’s death. For more on Phinick, see Chasing Phinick on page 14. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.724,r=0.454,b=0.907), with ID 31b58a2b-3d62-4b24-97b2-1247b35bb4e4 -->

**Roth Garley (LN male human sheriff):** Roth
is the only law in town, but he does relatively <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.908,r=0.455,b=0.940), with ID f609c1ca-5959-472e-9852-150467b3018d -->

when Bort is murdered, Roth's only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.273,r=0.821,b=0.376), with ID fda0023f-b690-48b6-8e06-687d91ffff2e -->

Sir Lawren Krent (LG male human ex-paladin): Poor Sir Lawren arrived here a few months ago when the caravan he was traveling with left without him. Disgraced and drunken, Sir Lawren saw things during the fall of Lastwall that he cannot unsee without the aid of strong drink. He can most often be found drinking in the tavern of the Feedmill or passed out in a lean-to shelter nearby. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.371,r=0.821,b=0.526), with ID 3ef013a6-f6f9-4fe1-a97f-78a095efb9bf -->

Targen Fulst (CG male human mayor): Targen was known around town as being a bit forgetful 20 years ago, but at age 80, he is mostly infirm, with poor eyesight and trouble walking more than a few steps at a time. His memory is now badly failing him, and he has trouble remembering the name of his daughter Delma, sometimes referring to her as Reganna, his long-passed wife. The entire Fulst family is related to Etran Bolmere, who founded the town a few hundred years ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.526,r=0.820,b=0.678), with ID 6b7bc0ed-82d9-4f67-9bbd-e0284f369339 -->

Although Targen has long abdicated any mayoral
responsibilities, the town has yet to name a new
mayor, seeing no need with so few inhabitants.
Targen lost most of his family to goblins in the
Goblinblood war, and as a result, he is very
distrusting of any goblin characters he might meet,
keeping an eye on them and clutching at valuables.
However, he has grown to tolerate Phinick. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.678,r=0.821,b=0.801), with ID ec041fa9-b7b4-4835-87fc-e374bedc2277 -->

Trin Sathern (NG female human server): Working every night at the Feedmill, Trin dreams of escaping Etran’s Folly. She desperately wants to leave this place and make a new life for herself in Almas or some other city. If the players show any sign of helping her leave town, she becomes especially friendly, as the thought of getting out of the place is almost intoxicating to her. She is excited to hear any tale about faraway lands or unfamiliar places. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.801,r=0.822,b=0.940), with ID 7b9f7382-4de8-4fa4-9b7a-3aa452fd7680 -->

BORT'S TALES  
The following are just a sample of the outlandish stories told by the traveling merchant Bort Bargith. These tales are so practiced that Bort receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Perform checks to impress when he uses one of them and to any Deception check he attempts to defend the tales' more outlandish claims. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.194,t=0.120,r=0.506,b=0.249), with ID 061bdf24-2256-4530-85f6-b465ef689a6e -->

**Bort and the Chilled Giant:** In this tale, Bort was traveling through one of the high mountain roads in the Five Kings Mountains when his caravan was captured by a fire giant. As Bort was being lowered into a kettle, he managed to trick the giant into using a rare plant called “frostbloom” in his soup, claiming it was quite spicy. When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.

**Pharasma’s Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort’s boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.193,t=0.249,r=0.511,b=0.632), with ID 141024bb-35e7-4d9f-9abc-18078363c3e8 -->

BORT'S CARAVAN AND CREW
Traveling all around the Five King's Mountains and into the lands beyond, Bort's Merchant Caravan is well known and regarded as a fair and honest purveyor of goods, raw materials, and supplies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.657,r=0.524,b=0.740), with ID ba99902c-60c6-44c5-b28e-7567302436f1 -->

**Bort Bargith (NG male dwarf merchant):** Bort keeps his prodigious beard immaculately trimmed and well maintained. Bort is a friendly, honest merchant, who prides himself on having whatever a small community might need. He’s warm and caring toward the members of his crew and polite and courteous to his paying passengers. He can often be found with a mug of ale in one hand and savory food in the other, telling some outlandish story about his travels, which generally involves him getting out of danger in the most ridiculous of ways (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar). He is slow to anger, quick to laugh, and more than capable of verbally dancing out of any danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.741,r=0.524,b=0.940), with ID 1c99740d-ff29-4ea1-89ef-2fe01a849ea1 -->

Cooky (LN old male elf cook): Aged even for an elf, Cooky’s real name is Talair Starlight, although only Bort knows that. To everyone else he is Cooky, the merchant caravan’s resident cook—although some call him “cocky” behind his back, owing to the fact that he only has one ear and is constantly tilting his head to one side to compensate. Attached to the back of Cooky’s wagon is a large iron pan that can hold hot coals and even burning logs, allowing him to slow cook stew in a pot above the flames, even while travelling. Cooky has a hard time hearing most folk, although many of the others in the caravan think he can hear just fine and chooses to ignore others when they irritate him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.127,r=0.892,b=0.325), with ID 1ec32208-71ea-4af4-91dd-f5964680596c -->

**Glunda Grapeleaf (N female gnome teamster):**
Born in heart of the Fangwood, Glunda has always had a strong tie to the beasts and plants of the world. When she was taken in by the druids in Crystalhurst, she developed her skills, even learning to speak with animals. Her time with the druids was not to last, for soon after the desire to wander called to her, and she left Nirmathas, joining up with Bort’s caravan to travel and see the world. Glunda regularly uses her rudimentary skills to speak to the pack animals and tend to their needs. She almost never talks to anyone other than Tamli and Bort unless absolutely necessary, preferring to sleep near the animals rather than gather round the fire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 4bd9a11a-ff3b-4e0a-8a1d-dadf52bfb9b8 -->

Olf and Ulf Redfren (CG male human teamsters):
Hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twin Ulfen brothers used to be part of a merchant vessel that plied the waters of Lake Encarthan, but when war came the region, the boat was sunk and the two barely made it to shore alive. They signed up with Bort soon after. These gregarious brothers like to play pranks on the other members of the caravan and their traveling companions and frequently dress alike and try to confuse people as to who is Olf and who is Ulf. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.541,r=0.891,b=0.693), with ID 5e585438-a6d0-42ca-812f-680dc94c0631 -->

Tamli Grent (LN female half-orc chief): If Bort is the smiling face behind the caravan, Tamli is its overseer. As Bort’s second in command, Tamli oversees the other staff and wagons in the train, making sure that all are in good spirits and good working order respectively. She is skilled at handling beasts of burden, but stern with the other members of the caravan. Her personal manner with outsiders and passengers are a bit brusque and awkward. She carries a lock of hair on a leather cord around her neck that’s from her son, who she lost years ago when she fled from Belkzen. She doesn’t like to talk about it with those she doesn’t trust. The only person she regularly confides in is Bort, although she can often be heard barking orders at the other members of the caravan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.695,r=0.891,b=0.938), with ID 47e2429b-70e4-4d0c-83c2-d29461592648 -->

CHARACTER CREATION AND BACKGROUNDS
This adventure is designed for 1st-level characters, built using the rules found in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. In addition to the backgrounds presented in that book, the following are additional background options available to PCs at the start of the game to represent their ties to the world and the story that is unfolding in Isger and its neighboring countries. Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.118,r=0.455,b=0.390), with ID 8c16c9b0-b562-4d96-8d0a-79853cb8b10d -->

Lesser Scion  
You are the youngest child in a noble house (in Cheliax, Isger, or Andoran) and stand to inherit nothing from your family. Although you have a minor title, it affords you no lands or wealth, but it has garnered you a small amount of respect and deference in your travels. When play begins, you are riding in a caravan bound for Almas, where a cousin has promised to allow you to stay with them for a month. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.399,r=0.454,b=0.540), with ID 246b09e5-57a7-4c72-9bca-d76b7b5095a3 -->

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity
or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
  You are trained in the Diplomacy skill and the
Heraldry Lore skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.541,r=0.454,b=0.604), with ID 0cced0c8-0bfc-4845-916f-1fc3dfd8b80f -->

**LOST AND ALONE**  
You were training to become a knight in Lastwall when the Whispering Tyrant escaped his imprisonment and destroyed the nation. It was only by dumb luck that you are alive at all, but the memories of that fateful day haunt your dreams. When play begins, you have boarded a caravan heading toward a new town, having worn out your welcome at the taverns and inns of Elidir. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.613,r=0.453,b=0.755), with ID db7e593b-a6e1-4d35-b887-d11ffca800f0 -->

Missionary  
You received training from clergy in a faraway temple, who sent you out into the world to spread the faith. Although you are relatively new at this, you are always on the lookout for new places in need of your deity’s teachings and guidance. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan making your way <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.828,r=0.454,b=0.942), with ID 738b1f8f-fd95-4642-bae6-ad6cb140284a -->

GM NOTES: BACKGROUNDS  
Although the characters can be of  
any background, you should encourage the  
players to consider the ones presented in  
this adventure, as characters with these  
backgrounds will find it easier to integrate  
themselves into the story. These backgrounds also  
help contextualize the characters in the events of  
the world around them.  
  GMs should take particular note if any  
of the PCs are interested in selecting the  
teamster background. The group should  
contain no more than one character with this  
background. The adventure assumes that any  
such character just joined the caravan and  
hence has no special knowledge about the  
other teamsters or the town of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.112,r=0.818,b=0.397), with ID f7b8d3e4-d3ff-49af-a4b3-1ef74b764d38 -->

REFUGEE  
The fighting around the Lake Encarthan region has forced many of the people residing there to flee from the violence. Although your home is gone, you have managed to survive and are making your way south in search of a better life. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan taking you to what might be either a new home in Andoran or simply another waypoint in your journey. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.523,r=0.819,b=0.662), with ID 01b313d7-8ede-4b50-95bf-49d67c2ad819 -->

Teamster  
You left your home a few months back for a life on the road, working for one caravan company and then another, always on the lookout for a new job and a better life. Last week, you were hired by the Bort Bargith’s company in Elidir. You don’t know anyone from the company just yet, but most of its members seem to be honest merchants and traders. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.752,r=0.819,b=0.877), with ID 676e756b-c0bc-4ed4-956b-9ce25c78ac2c -->

# ALCHEMICAL CROSSBOW

UNCOMMON  ALCHEMICAL

This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an _acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bottled lightning, frost vial_, or _thunderstone_). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.336,r=0.526,b=0.681), with ID 814e3cad-7f06-4db2-8c88-bda5de9672f4 -->

Noala’s Training  
After the PCs assist Noala in finding the source of the blight and investigating the Pen, she agrees to teach them some of her special woodland survival techniques. Her knowledge can be disseminated in several of the following ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.844,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID e455d4ac-2e08-47f6-89c5-a7dd2dce7c69 -->

**Ranger Archetype:** Noala can assist any character that is looking into selecting the ranger multiclass archetype. Furthermore, if a character has the ranger archetype, Noala’s Wilderness Spotter feat counts as a ranger archetype feat for that character (if the character selects the feat multiple times, it is a ranger archetype feat only the first time). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.234), with ID 507e9fe5-0662-4b3f-865f-6ef30b8d6abb -->

**Retraining:** Noala can serve as a teacher who can retrain ranger feats and skill feats as long as the new skill feat is linked to Nature or Survival. As long as the feat being trained is level 5 or lower, Noala reduces the training time to the minimum allowed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.235,r=0.454,b=0.326), with ID d38c3460-dd63-4680-94dc-337514c1d07c -->

**Special Feats:** Noala can teach the characters a special ranger feat as well as a special skill feat that can be taken by anyone trained in Survival. Note that Noala’s training does not grant characters these feats, but merely unlocks them for later selection. This training takes about 2 days per feat but can take place at the same time as any retraining performed with Noala. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.327,r=0.455,b=0.435), with ID 7d4e662c-e66d-4625-a5a6-6179da299280 -->

UNCOMMON        MOVE        RANGER

Trigger An adjacent creature you are hunting attempts to move away from you using an action that has the move trait.
Your hunted prey cannot escape your relentless pursuit. Stride up to your Speed in tandem with the triggering creature, remaining adjacent to the foe throughout its movement until it stops moving or you run out of movement. You can ignore difficult terrain during this movement unless the difficult terrain is caused by a magical effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.443,r=0.455,b=0.633), with ID 750bde85-1fc2-448f-be36-93608b878fc6 -->

WILDERNESS SPOTTER FEAT 2
UNCOMMON   GENERAL   SKILL
Prerequisite Expert in Survival
Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren’t tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.643,r=0.454,b=0.846), with ID efc30646-6448-4b56-96da-5473f52cec36 -->

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.847,r=0.454,b=0.880), with ID 1b2c3833-d68c-461f-baee-fce353d2c320 -->

Fiery Leopard  
Through their actions at the Pen, the PCs might have befriended the fiery leopard found in area H3. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.888,r=0.455,b=0.942), with ID 8cb92e77-3ede-43ba-ac2d-e4158a10ccc4 -->

Once released, the leopard bolts from the Pen, but, at the GM’s discretion, it might appear again to help with the fight against the alchemical dredge at the very end of this adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.125,r=0.785,b=0.203), with ID 6e9d7947-df94-4220-aced-c23c535de866 -->

After this point, the leopard continues to shadow the group and anyone with Nature can slowly attempt to befriend the wild beast. This process should take at least 10 downtime days, during which time the character attempting to befriend the leopard must succeed on at least three DC 18 Nature checks. No more than one check may be attempted per day. If the character fails to succeed at three Nature checks within this time, the leopard loses interest and wanders off. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.204,r=0.820,b=0.357), with ID a9806b65-d9c8-4a62-b83f-8587397482ed -->

If successful, and if the character has the ability to take on an animal companion, then that character gains the fiery leopard as an animal companion at the end of the 10 days. Treat the fiery leopard as a cat (see page 215 of the Core Rulebook) with the following modifications. If no one takes the fiery leopard as an animal companion, it will never truly be part of the group, but it may still follow them on adventures and help out at random times, subject to the GM’s discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.356,r=0.821,b=0.510), with ID ef302beb-9541-468a-8446-1535f55d498d -->

**Burning Glow** The fiery leopard sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius which gives it a –2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks made at night or in a dark environment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.725,r=0.821,b=0.773), with ID 582a286d-a57d-4c85-b9ee-16b244aefedd -->

### BORT’S INHERITANCE
Being a well-groomed merchant with a penchant for finery, Bort is fond of jewelry, particularly rings. He has a number of fine magical rings in his collection that he keeps among the rest of his possessions in his wagon when he’s not wearing them. Bort has collected these rings from his travels, and aside from being valuable magic items in their own right, Bort has an associated story and memory from each of them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.782,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID 7de19b97-3708-4282-a47b-6d1c8f295fb0 -->

BACKGROUND SIDE QUESTS  
Depending on the backgrounds of the player characters, one or more small side quests might occur during this adventure. While all are focused on backgrounds presented in this adventure, most are also suitable for characters with certain backgrounds from the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook* (noted where relevant in parentheses in the Background entry). These side quests can occur at any point during the adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.119,r=0.456,b=0.280), with ID 8a70f502-5497-4439-8e11-2de184a5a6b0 -->

Finally, the refugee background doesn’t have a
specific side quest presented here, but you are free to
add if you wish. Use the side quests presented here as
examples when building your own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.281,r=0.454,b=0.343), with ID b7806ce9-59de-4de5-90c7-283cb6617d85 -->

Dereliction and Redemption  
Background: lost and alone (Warrior)  
Sir Lawren Krent is running from far more than just the nightmares he saw during the fall of Lastwall: he is also hiding from a terrible shame. Unfortunately, the result of his cowardice followed him here to Etran’s Folly, and it wants revenge. Just after sunset, Sir Lawren approaches the characters with a look of worry and panic on his face. Speaking directly to the character with the appropriate background, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.353,r=0.454,b=0.528), with ID 57a52152-802e-4e7d-b32b-f122b866ba8c -->

Krent looks at you with his eyes wide and bloodshot.  
“Talmore, my old friend. You have to help me. I think *his* minions have followed us here. I seen ’em. They’re coming!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.538,r=0.453,b=0.591), with ID 4c263f04-7405-4005-8d16-3a20d07181c4 -->

Krent is clearly deep into his drink, and in his
altered state, he sees one of the PCs as his former
comrade Talmore. Though he’s clearly mistaken,
what is real is his apparent terror that minions of
the Whispering Tyrant have followed him to Etran’s
Folly. In truth, Krent is partly correct. Talmore was
a fellow crusader in Lastwall and Krent’s close
friend, but when Lastwall fell, Krent left Talmore’s
side during a fight to hide from the undead horde.
When it was over, he searched the battlefield only
to find his friend’s mangled body. Distraught, Krent
took Talmore’s holy symbol and fled. The incident
weighs heavily on poor Krent, and he’s been running
ever since. Now, the knight is seeing things, but while
most of his visions are simply manifestations of his
shame and guilt, one is not. The ghost of Talmore is
indeed haunting him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.601,r=0.453,b=0.862), with ID 843fa210-cfa3-482f-8a8a-692a4fbb66be -->

From this point onward, Krent sees the PC as his long-lost friend, recounting old tales, apologizing for the time he left a scar on his face after accidentally cutting him during sparring practice, and asking how he managed to escape Lastwall. If the PC <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.863,r=0.453,b=0.941), with ID 984eb440-dcfe-42a4-81ed-3ff8a9f91dfa -->

acts confused, Krent merely plays it off  
as a joke and continues treating the PC  
as Talmore. Clever characters might easily  
get Krent to reveal parts of his history by  
pretending to be Talmore. Throughout, Krent  
insists that the enemy is here, begging his friend  
for help in defeating the vile undead agents. If the  
character agrees, Krent says that they are hiding in  
an old ruined farmhouse that Krent occupied when  
he first came to town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.122,r=0.813,b=0.281), with ID e65423ee-bee9-4106-8b9f-8b9abf0cab1f -->

Confronting the Ghost        Moderate 1
The creature that dwells here is the ghost of Talmore, bound to the holy symbol that Krent took from his dead body. If the PCs enter the dilapidated house, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.291,r=0.820,b=0.373), with ID 1ac3820c-2553-46dd-8e10-167f45928b43 -->

A sagging straw roof barely protects this abandoned house from the elements. Piles of debris litter the common room, which shows signs of occupation, although not too recently. A backpack sits in one corner with a glint of silver inside its open flap, resting next to a shattered chair and a moldy old blanket. Quite suddenly the air seems to grow cold, and the sound of moaning fills the house. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.384,r=0.819,b=0.512), with ID 32d9f36d-118d-42f8-8624-d689d87845ec -->

The ghost of Talmore appears and attacks any who are inside the home (using the statistics of a ghost commoner with the weak adjustment), but he will not pursue them or attack downed foes. He looks like the gaunt form of a soldier whose raiment is quite similar to Sir Lawren’s. The ghost appears to have a nasty-looking scar running down one side of his face. If the ghost is defeated, he rematerializes after only a few days to continue haunting the holy symbol of Iomedae. The only way to put him to rest is by giving the holy symbol a proper burial, something the PCs can learn if they know the holy symbol’s origin and succeed at a DC 16 Religion check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.524,r=0.819,b=0.724), with ID 2c4897f7-ef8c-40ce-9e75-33fc559e6a96 -->

The characters can avoid fighting the ghost if they
can convince Krent to enter the home and apologize
to the ghost of his friend. If he does so, the ghost
fades away for the evening, allowing the PCs to bury
the holy symbol in peace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.725,r=0.820,b=0.802), with ID b723e90a-7c93-4001-bb25-b1df132c7d09 -->

Upon putting the spirit to rest, Sir Lawren Krent
looks like he has been freed from a heavy burden. In

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a spectral armored knight holding a glowing sword and shield, labeled "Ghost of Talmore".

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a ghostly knight clad in full plate armor, rendered in shades of blue and white to convey a spectral, ethereal appearance.
  • The knight holds a large, ornate shield with a radiant sunburst or star-like symbol glowing on its surface.
  • The sword and shield both emit a blue, misty glow, enhancing the supernatural effect.
  • The figure stands in a heroic pose, with one foot forward and the sword angled downward.
  • The label "Ghost of Talmore" appears at the bottom of the image in a stylized font on a dark background.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses a high-contrast, luminous color palette dominated by blues and whites.
  • The armor is detailed with layered plates, a skirt, and a belt, with flowing, wispy elements suggesting incorporeality.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The knight is centrally positioned, occupying most of the frame.
  • The shield is held forward and to the left, while the sword is held to the right.
  • Some plant-like elements are visible at the upper left edge, partially framing the figure.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of power, protection, and otherworldliness, likely representing a fantasy or mythological character.
  • The glowing effects and spectral color scheme emphasize the ghostly, supernatural nature of the "Ghost of Talmore".
  • The composition draws attention to the shield's symbol, possibly indicating its significance to the character's identity or abilities. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.034,t=0.320,r=0.530,b=0.947), with ID 4d7704c7-b0bd-4682-b187-3fc0c394e16b -->

has a revelation. This PC is a distant relative of both
Targen and the town’s founder, Etran Bolmere.
  When Targen hears the name of the PCs, read or
paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.126,r=0.892,b=0.189), with ID c47a537d-02b9-462e-9a3c-ab31be70a757 -->

“Well, isn’t that peculiar.” The aging mayor stares at you intently. “I thought something about you looked familiar. I think we might be kin. Distantly, but I remember my father telling tales of the family history, and your family was mentioned at least once.” As he continues, he seems almost disappointed. “Such a shame that the family history went up in flames with the rest of the Bolmere estate.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.201,r=0.891,b=0.312), with ID 76e16636-0387-4357-b331-c3c56c9b9e5e -->

Targen knows nothing else about the relationship, stating that any proof would reside in the ruins of the Bolmere estate, atop Etran’s Hill. In any case, after he lets Delma know that the PC is kin, that PC receives free room and board at the Feedmill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.325,r=0.891,b=0.402), with ID 82e29cb1-f37a-4977-8021-40a58f770a33 -->

The ruins of the Bolmere estate are just south of
town. The place is entirely overgrown, but much
of the scorched and crumbling stonework can still
be seen under a layer of moss and ivy. Thoroughly
searching the ruins takes at least an hour. At the end
of that time, roll a secret DC 18 Perception check
for each character taking a look around. If anyone
succeeds, they spot a loose piece of stone masonry in
the crumbling chimney set into the estate’s north wall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.404,r=0.890,b=0.539), with ID a5831250-ec95-44ec-a5ac-7788e03186bf -->

Reward: Behind the stone is a copper lockbox covered in a green patina. Inside is an old, leather-bound book and a tarnished silver amulet. The book is a piece of the Bolmere family history, listing births and deaths going back several hundred years. Looking through these names does confirm a distant relationship between the PC, the Bolmere family, and Targen and his daughter. There might very well be other revelations in here, but those are left for you to decide based on the character’s backstory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.541,r=0.891,b=0.693), with ID 4500c418-b223-4f9f-80e4-584bc0f2711e -->

The silver amulet is an old family treasure. While
it bears a faint aura of conjuration, it does not seem
to have any powers, but the word “Karvasalon”
is carved into the back. If someone wearing
the amulet casts a _planar ally_ ritual while
speaking that name, instead of what they
were intending to call, the amulet calls
a mysterious creature cloaked in
shadows. This thing has served
the family for centuries, and
although no one has called it
in many years, it still answers the summons. The
creature refuses to say why, but when asked about
the arrangement, it merely states that it owes “an
eternal debt.” The exact statistics and abilities of
Karvasalon are up to you to decide, as is the creature’s

true nature, but it should in some way speak to the
character’s backstory and history. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.159), with ID cad0f900-c32c-4b0f-8def-d7fd2f2eeab1 -->

Last Delivery  
Background: Teamster  
Bort’s death has repercussions for the members of the caravan, including for any PC who works for the caravan, even if they are relatively new to the team. The most pressing challenges are being handled by Tamli and the others, but in going through Bort’s ledgers, she discovers that he still has one last delivery to make here in town. This side quest can occur at any time after Bort’s death, starting when Tamli comes to find them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.169,r=0.453,b=0.342), with ID eeef313a-f153-4b4a-932c-c2324c4e3e42 -->

Emerging from the yard, you can see Tamli carrying something long and awkward wrapped in burlap. She catches your eye and makes her way straight to you. “I have a little chore that needs to be seen to. Bort’s final delivery is here in town, and it needs to be done delicately.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.353,r=0.452,b=0.436), with ID 20b123d4-70f4-41d5-89be-8a508d328b04 -->

Tamli unwraps the burlap bundle to reveal a pair of sparring swords that were ordered by Pari Hemsoth, a young woman who lives with her mother on a farm about a mile from town. Bort’s records for the delivery included a rather cryptic note that reads, “Make sure the mother doesn’t find out.” While Tamli does not quite know what this means, she trusts that the PCs will deliver the goods discreetly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.447,r=0.452,b=0.571), with ID a57791f9-2f6c-45c8-b331-92cc6d23c0fe -->

In truth, Pari wants the swords so that she can
advance her training. She hopes to leave this town
sometime soon, hopefully as an adventurer. This has
been her dream since she was little, when her older
brother died in the Goblinblood Wars, but the loss
of her brother has made her mother paranoid and
extremely overprotective of her only remaining child.
  Getting out to the Hemsoth farm is not difficult,
but approaching it to make the delivery without
being spotted by Pari’s mother takes a bit of ingenuity.
The PCs could simply use Stealth, but making it up
to the farm without being seen requires succeeding
at at least two consecutive DC 18 Stealth checks.
Failure results in Elmora, the mother, storming out
and demanding that the “vagrants” get off her farm
at once. She does not want any adventurers talking
to her daughter. Another option is for the PCs to
try distracting the mother with a Bluff, Diplomacy,
or even Thievery check, making it much easier for
someone else to sneak up. Ultimately, any reasonable
plan should have a good chance of success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.573,r=0.452,b=0.888), with ID b2884804-0b78-4cb5-b158-68d30bcd7df9 -->

Once the PCs have found a way to deliver the
swords, Pari is very grateful. While she is happy
that she can continue her training regardless, she <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.894,r=0.453,b=0.939), with ID 9375856d-e532-4495-b4b5-352357cd5714 -->

asks if any of the PCs might be willing  
to help her learn how to use a sword. If a  
PC agrees, she will happily pay for the service.  
This allows a character to spend downtime to  
earn gold, using their attack bonus in place of  
a Lore or Crafting skill modifier as long as they  
are trained in martial weapons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.126,r=0.787,b=0.235), with ID 76968835-c199-4f46-a2cc-157f7cb37a3a -->

New Faith  
Background: Missionary (Acolyte)  
The town of Etran’s Folly has not had a proper church since Father Bolgrist died of the plague nearly 20 years ago. When the plague hit and the fiery priest of Gozreh blamed Silwyth, calling her a witch, most in town believed him. When the priest himself succumbed to the plague, most considered the matter closed. Since then, the town has been without a priest and his shrine has fallen into ruin, being used as a barn on the edge of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.247,r=0.818,b=0.417), with ID f2009756-c688-412e-bd1f-758d08748c1e -->

If the characters poke around the old church, an
aging dwarven farmer ambles up and asks what they
want with his barn. Introducing himself as Metmon,
he explains that he has been using the old church as
a barn for almost 10 years now, but he doesn’t have
too much use for it these days. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.419,r=0.818,b=0.509), with ID 7790473f-1ca6-42d8-a958-bec1c080d5c9 -->

If the PC show signs of faith, Metmon says that
they can have the old building if they plan on
bringing “godly ways” back to the town. Metmon is
a worshipper of Abadar, but he will be just as happy
to see the church of any good or lawful neutral
deity established in town. He even offers the help of
his son, Edfur, in cleaning out the place. If the PCs
agree, this can become a downtime activity for one
or more characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.511,r=0.817,b=0.646), with ID 67b4fc82-7b54-4b1e-aa90-76d83bf0521c -->

Clearing out the church and repairing the roof take at least 20 days to complete, but this can be reduced to 15 with Edfur’s help. During this time, if one of the PCs helping Edfur is trained in Religion, the young dwarf becomes very curious about that PC’s faith, asking all sorts of questions and showing a genuine interest in the PC’s beliefs. If the PC engages with Edfur, he asks what he has to do to become a priest of the faith. He explains that if he can learn enough, he hopes to one day become the town’s priest, leading the people of Etran’s Folly in spiritual matters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.649,r=0.817,b=0.831), with ID 15df189b-67e3-40bb-a591-28148d465c0d -->

How this side quest comes to a conclusion is
really up to the PC. They can spend time with Edfur,
teaching him about the faith, or they can send him
to nearby Elidir for more formal training. The PC
might decide to stay in Etran’s Folly for a time,
tending to the locals until Edfur is ready, or they
might even retire from adventuring to live here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.834,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 50ea5414-9868-4354-aee0-d836a661dc13 -->

While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims’ wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.119,r=0.408,b=0.343), with ID c920c7a8-b410-4e34-acd1-819c91be23cb -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a fantasy plant creature, likely from a tabletop roleplaying game bestiary, depicting a menacing, animated vine with a bulbous, toothy head and leafy base.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a single, large, dark purple vine with a curved, serpentine stem.
  • The vine terminates in a bulbous head with two fang-like protrusions, suggesting a predatory or carnivorous nature.
  • The base of the vine is surrounded by a dense cluster of green leaves, indicating it is rooted in the ground.
  • The background is white, with some partial text visible on the right, suggesting the image is cropped from a book or manual.
  • The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the colour palette is dominated by dark purples, greens, and browns.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference is present.
  • No visible text or labels within the illustration itself.
  • The style is clean, digital, and semi-realistic, typical of modern fantasy bestiaries.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The vine's head is positioned in the upper left quadrant, curving downward and inward, drawing attention to its fanged mouth.
  • The leafy base occupies the lower portion of the image, spreading horizontally.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the vine's head and base occupying distinct visual zones.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of threat and animation, suggesting the plant is capable of movement or attack.
  • The exaggerated curvature and fanged head imply a creature designed for ambush or ensnaring prey.
  • The dense foliage at the base contrasts with the stark, predatory head, emphasizing both its plant and monster characteristics. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.480,r=0.508,b=0.963), with ID 4162ec71-5b73-45ed-8883-199d379c9ccb -->

**Blood Siphon** ![inline figure: two black diamond icons] The tendrils of the bush reach out to siphon the blood from a victim up to 20 feet away with persistent bleed damage, causing the victim to immediately take that amount of bleed damage (basic Reflex DC 17). The bush regains an amount of Hit Points equal to double the damage dealt. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.326,r=0.885,b=0.402), with ID 41b46ad9-0eb5-409d-a1d5-88bcab4a16f8 -->

**Spinning Strike** ![inline micro-figure: three black chevrons] The bush spins in a circle, lashing out in all directions at once. It makes one attack roll and compares the result to the AC of each creature within its melee reach, rolling damage only once and applying it to each creature hit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.402,r=0.889,b=0.464), with ID d5f31bdf-23ab-462c-8871-f7902580a01c -->

**Weeping Wounds** A bloodlash bush’s vines cause terrible lacerations that continue to bleed. A creature hit with a vine attack takes 1 persistent bleed damage (2 on a critical hit). Unlike other forms of persistent damage, this damage is cumulative, to a maximum of 5 persistent bleed damage but it can be stopped like any other persistent bleed damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.463,r=0.889,b=0.541), with ID 2e703f06-d2ca-4fc2-9747-f5bd862cb656 -->

**Light Hold** A creature grabbed by a vine lasher is not immobilized, but the grabbed creature's space and every adjacent square use the rules for difficult terrain. If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed creature within 10 feet of itself. If two or more vine lashers have a creature grabbed in this way, then the target's space and adjacent square instead use the rules for greater difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.440,t=0.709,r=0.891,b=0.802), with ID c101afff-83e8-4ca6-a692-654767dc7cd9 -->

Often overlooked in light of more obvious threats, some plants can be just as deadly and dangerous as wild beasts.
    The bloodlash bush attempts to lacerate its foes, using its weeping wounds to irrigate the ground around itself. The seeds of a bloodlash bush can take root only in soil that has been soaked in blood.
    The vine lasher attacks in groups, attempting to immobilize prey and slowly tear a creature to pieces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.448,t=0.815,r=0.893,b=0.941), with ID 3e9bad5a-c5f9-4384-9bdb-1922119c07ec -->

**Siphon Vitality** ![figure: two black droplet icons] The blood ooze draws forth blood from nearby creatures, causing their flesh to break open and blood to spill out which replenishes the blood ooze.

VARIANTS
Blood oozes are sometimes made from creatures with very different types of blood that can occasional impart other powers and abilities to the resulting blood ooze. Blood oozes made from dragon blood often gain some small amount of energy resistance based on the dragon’s type (fire resistance 5 for an ooze crafted from a red dragon, for example). Those made from trolls gain a limited form of regeneration. Finally, a blood ooze made from the blood of fiends might gain a cruel and vindictive intelligence drawn from the thoughts and minds of its parent creatures. Such an ooze might even work with others, tricking lesser creatures into thinking it is some sort of deity or engaging in whatever ruse it can contrive to secure a constant source of fresh blood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.591,t=0.112,r=0.819,b=0.559), with ID 5aed4bfc-a376-4236-86c3-f8fe559aa243 -->

Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws near, leaving the body a husk of its former self. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.585,r=0.477,b=0.678), with ID ce3715c3-4502-4625-a619-6ed87aefb36d -->

The process by which such an ooze is created
involves draining the blood of at least four
Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected
blood to a fifth creature, along with deadly reagents
designed to prevent the blood from coagulating.
During this time, the host slowly dies while the
blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6 hours later.
Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who
created them, but some creators have noted that
newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming
other members of the host creature’s family. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.678,r=0.439,b=0.848), with ID efb39ecd-9a67-40b9-85c9-78b6ba29c696 -->

It is not widely known that an existing
blood ooze can reproduce by splitting
itself in half. It undergoes this division
only if it has grown so large that
splitting in half would create a pair of
normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed above. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.848,r=0.469,b=0.940), with ID fbdcaa1d-7327-466c-be22-0d4c52be89f6 -->

ADVENTURE

A TROUBLED TOWN

A group of new adventurers traveling through the village of Etran’s Folly—also known as Plaguestone—must come together to solve the murder of a friend. What starts as a simple investigation quickly turns sinister with the discovery of forbidden alchemy, mutant animals, and a nearby forest rotting away due to a mysterious blight. It becomes clear that if these heroes don’t intervene to stop whatever evil is brewing, the fall of Plaguestone is all but certain!

Scene Overview :  
  • Three armored and armed characters are present: one crouched in the foreground with a shield, one with long white hair in blue clothing to the left, and one standing on a rock in the background aiming a crossbow.  
  • The setting is a lush, green forest with large, twisted tree roots and dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy.  
  • The composition is dynamic, with the foreground character partially behind a wooden crate, the middle character turning toward the background, and the background character elevated and aiming a weapon.  
  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and muted blues, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.

Technical Details :  
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.  
  • The illustration style is painterly and detailed, typical of fantasy role-playing game art.  
  • The lighting emphasizes the central action, with bright light streaming from the background and casting shadows in the foreground.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The crouched character with a shield is in the immediate foreground, occupying the right side of the image.  
  • The character in blue is positioned to the left, slightly behind the foreground figure, and appears to be reacting to the background character.  
  • The standing character with the crossbow is in the background, elevated on a rock, and is the focal point of the other two characters’ attention.  
  • Wooden crates and boxes are scattered in the foreground, suggesting a campsite or supply area.

Analysis :  
  • The illustration conveys a moment of tension or confrontation, with the two foreground characters appearing surprised or defensive in response to the armed figure in the background.  
  • The use of lighting and composition draws the viewer’s eye from the foreground action to the background threat, enhancing the sense of narrative and drama.  
  • The setting and costumes suggest a high-fantasy adventure scenario, possibly from a game or graphic novel. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.246,r=0.998,b=0.682), with ID 35cdc92f-71ea-41f1-8ed6-1a34dd4d3e18 -->
