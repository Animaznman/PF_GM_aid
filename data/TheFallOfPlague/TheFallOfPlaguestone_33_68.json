The Black Cave\nThis cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.276,r=0.818,b=0.372), with ID 01206a8a-5c74-42a2-9e81-579bf27dda4e -->\n\nOpening the cage door does not anger the leopard or cause it to attack.

It glares at the sight of another creature entering, letting out a weak snarl that fades into a plaintive yowl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.462,r=0.818,b=0.543), with ID 8e912aa0-bfba-4e4e-97ef-5e350bcad823 -->\n\n**Creature:** The fiery leopard is in far too much pain to fight the PCs unless they provoke it. Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation. A character trained in Nature can approach the leopard and calm it with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy skill check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check.

Almost a dozen sleeping mats are nestled in nooks and built into the walls throughout this space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.766,r=0.891,b=0.879), with ID 35eb04aa-eef2-4831-a776-c17ed2ab6cea -->\n\nThe orcs use these two caves as their home; unless  \nthe alarm has been raised, this chamber usually has  \na few orcs in it at all times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.892,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID 8f78157b-db1e-4c4b-8acb-d90b6b3fe81d -->\n\n38 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.938,r=0.072,b=0.955), with ID 4393976e-2a92-40fc-b331-9fb6aee79698 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.308,t=0.987,r=0.693,b=1.000), with ID b2810db9-b496-4c0f-9462-39663c3f13d2 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.304,t=0.000,r=0.695,b=0.016), with ID 60f22603-5846-48c0-8254-f3d468316465 -->\n\n**Creatures:** A total of eight orcs sleep in these chambers, although there is space for almost a dozen. Most of the bedrolls on the map actually indicate two nooks, one above and one below, both with sleeping mats and personal effects. During the day, there are usually five orcs here, with two in the yard and one more up in the tower with Graytusk. At night the number drops to just three, with four in the yard and a different orc up in the tower with Graytusk. If a fight breaks out in area 14, the orcs here will come to investigate during the second round of combat, using the first round to gather their weapons, entering the throne room singly or in pairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.327), with ID fe00d298-1889-4c9f-bf36-e19af22a884a -->\n\nORC BRUTES (5 OR 3)                CREATURE 0  \n*Pathfinder Bestiary* 256  \n**Initiative** Perception +5; darkvision <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.335,r=0.454,b=0.390), with ID fc739a58-ba4f-406a-b2f2-fc275144a48a -->\n\n**Rewards:** The orcs do not have much of value, but there are a few things of interest to be found here. Scattered among the nooks is 37 sp, 52 cp, and a lot of damaged or shoddy common items (such as ropes, whetstones, backpacks, and candles). If the PCs are looking for something in particular, there is a 50% chance they can find it so long as the item is not magical and has a value of 5 sp or less. Anyone searching the caves can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to find a small cache located under a rock beneath a bedroll. This cache contains an *invisibility potion* and a silver key (worth 1 gp) that unlocks the door to area **I8**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.402,r=0.454,b=0.588), with ID 9fafe4d5-f0e6-4821-a007-7f241ca662a6 -->\n\n15. Reception Hall                        Moderate 3\nThe large double door leading into Spite’s Cradle are made from heavy wooden planks reinforced with iron bands. They are locked from the inside with an average quality lock, but can be opened with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks or by using the bronze key that Lord Nar wears around his neck. The doors are emblazoned with the image of a small village in flames. This is clearly based on the image on the doors leading to the Sculptor’s chambers in the Pen, but it is more refined and was made by a more practiced hand.\n     Once the PCs find a way inside, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.598,r=0.454,b=0.802), with ID 2ac1dd1c-7152-496d-8df8-1f0867dfcc04 -->\n\nThe doors swing wide to reveal a small reception hall. A worn carpet stretches from the doors to another double door across the way. To the right is a curved wall with a map of the nearby area painted on it. Spite’s Cradle is in the center, with lines drawn to all of the nearby major settlements and noting travel times by horse.

After her research took her elsewhere, she placed the elementals here to serve as guardians, ordering them to attack anyone who enters the room who does not belong.

GUARD TOWER                                    LOW 3  \nThis tower actually consists of two locations: the tower’s interior and its covered rooftop. The area shown on the map is the interior.

One is an ordinary guard, from among those who dwell with Lord Nar. The other is Graytusk, the only capable hunter and tracker among the orcs. Unless she is out on the hunt, Graytusk spends all her time in the tower, either watching from the rooftop or getting a few hours of sleep in the interior room. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.821,b=0.678), with ID c3ab699a-ad0c-4f38-839a-b886f30f8410 -->\n\nAs noted in area 11, the primary job of the orcs here\nis to watch the yard. The orcs attempt Perception\nchecks against anyone in the yard every few minutes,\nincreasing to every round if there is a disturbance\n(such as falling rocks or a grappling hook thrown\nover the wall). If the orcs spot anything, their first\naction is to sound an alarm, alerting Nar and the\nother orcs that there’s trouble. Within a few rounds,\nall of the orcs are roused and in the yard. They\nremain this way for at least 30 minutes while they\ntry to figure out what’s going on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.678,r=0.820,b=0.847), with ID 77a57550-022d-44f7-9042-920408db8585 -->\n\nIn combat, the orc brute descends to area 12 using the stairs on the side of the tower. Graytusk stays here on the rooftop area, raining down arrows upon any intruder she sees. With 40 arrows in her quiver and 100 arrows in the bucket, she’ll be able to sustain that routine for quite a while. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.848,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID 51965a96-08ac-46a2-8da5-18c8a98f152f -->\n\nSummary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar from a fantasy roleplaying game book, listing the main sections of an adventure module.\n\nillustration:  \nScene Overview : \n  • The image features a vertical, ornate, fantasy-themed frame with purple, vine-like organic shapes and glowing accents.\n  • At the top, there is a globe or orb with swirling patterns and a flask, suggesting an alchemical or magical theme.\n  • The central area contains a parchment-like panel with a list of adventure parts and a toolbox section.\n  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and golds, with highlights and magical sparkles.\n\nTechnical Details : \n  • The text within the panel reads:\n    - \"Part 1: A Mysterious Murder\"\n    - \"Part 2: The Ranger's Request\"\n    - \"Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair\"\n    - \"Adventure Toolbox\"\n  • At the bottom, there are two small potion bottles, one green and one blue, resting on the frame.\n  • No scale bar, magnification, or UI elements are present.\n\nSpatial Relationships : \n  • The parchment panel is vertically oriented, occupying the center of the frame.\n  • Decorative elements extend outward, especially at the top and bottom, framing the text.\n  • The potion bottles are placed at the bottom left of the panel, partially overlapping the frame.\n\nAnalysis : \n  • The illustration is designed to visually organize and highlight the structure of the adventure, using fantasy motifs to reinforce the genre and draw attention to the module's main sections.

SILWYTH’S SHRINE                MODERATE 3\n\nStanding at one end of this long chamber is a marble statue of an elven woman holding a flask. She is dressed in a flowing gown, and liquid tears streak down her cheeks into a small pool surrounding the statue’s base.

Storage  \nThis chamber is piled high with boxes, barrels, and crates. While most are partially empty, they do contain a wide variety of alchemical tools, reagents, and supplies that could be used to create a vast array of alchemical items.

To this end, she experimented to create larger, smarter, and more capable alchemical servants. After a year of research, the first alchemical drudge was created. Appearing like large, wingless homonculi, four such creatures occupy this laboratory, overseeing basic tasks like tending an ongoing experiment or keeping the place tidy.

By consulting the formula book and inspecting the available ingredients, a PC can attempt a DC 22 Crafting check to identify this residue as a side effect of the viridian vapor.

Vilree’s gear could easily be plundered to create a set of alchemist’s tools, and the reagents present are enough to craft 80 gp worth of alchemical items.

A sputtering torch is mounted next to the door. In the distance, you can hear the sound of rushing water.\n\nThese caves are the reason Vilree moved her laboratory here. As the PCs get closer to the cave walls, the character with the highest Perception notices veins of green in the rock. This ore is a key ingredient in the creation of the viridian vapor, and part of the reason it is so deadly. When ground up, the green rock deals serious damage to the lungs, allowing an infection to take hold and grow within hours. If the characters have studied Vilree’s formula book, they know this green rock is called flaystone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.659,r=0.819,b=0.940), with ID 33a9b656-f894-4ce3-9dab-61376fb7de1e -->\n\n45 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.921,t=0.937,r=0.946,b=0.955), with ID 02445861-faf4-4146-8736-1ef5958bbb1a -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animazuman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.308,t=0.988,r=0.694,b=1.000), with ID 356db70f-0121-4982-a43c-c95840c4a4f5 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.001,r=0.695,b=0.015), with ID 9f7e1b8b-934e-4b04-a521-44e556c6e148 -->\n\n119.

Toward the end of that struggle, she was caught inside a burning building during a raid. Her right arm was terribly burned in the fire, making that hand all but useless.

Phinick is tolerated by the townsfolk, but only barely—a fact that keeps him on edge. The twitchy goblin is rather timid and shy around big folk, trying too hard to fit in. Phinick is bullied into adding a special “spice” to Bort’s food in Part 1 of the adventure, and he quickly goes into hiding after the merchant’s death.

His memory is now badly failing him, and he has trouble remembering the name of his daughter Delma, sometimes referring to her as Reganna, his long-passed wife.

She desperately wants to leave this place and make a new life for herself in Almas or some other city. If the players show any sign of helping her leave town, she becomes especially friendly, as the thought of getting out of the place is almost intoxicating to her.

As Bort was being lowered into a kettle, he managed to trick the giant into using a rare plant called “frostbloom” in his soup, claiming it was quite spicy. When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.\n\n**Pharasma’s Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort’s boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.193,t=0.249,r=0.511,b=0.632), with ID 141024bb-35e7-4d9f-9abc-18078363c3e8 -->\n\nBORT'S CARAVAN AND CREW\nTraveling all around the Five King's Mountains and into the lands beyond, Bort's Merchant Caravan is well known and regarded as a fair and honest purveyor of goods, raw materials, and supplies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.657,r=0.524,b=0.740), with ID ba99902c-60c6-44c5-b28e-7567302436f1 -->\n\n**Bort Bargith (NG male dwarf merchant):** Bort keeps his prodigious beard immaculately trimmed and well maintained. Bort is a friendly, honest merchant, who prides himself on having whatever a small community might need. He’s warm and caring toward the members of his crew and polite and courteous to his paying passengers. He can often be found with a mug of ale in one hand and savory food in the other, telling some outlandish story about his travels, which generally involves him getting out of danger in the most ridiculous of ways (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar). He is slow to anger, quick to laugh, and more than capable of verbally dancing out of any danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.741,r=0.524,b=0.940), with ID 1c99740d-ff29-4ea1-89ef-2fe01a849ea1 -->\n\nCooky (LN old male elf cook): Aged even for an elf, Cooky’s real name is Talair Starlight, although only Bort knows that. To everyone else he is Cooky, the merchant caravan’s resident cook—although some call him “cocky” behind his back, owing to the fact that he only has one ear and is constantly tilting his head to one side to compensate. Attached to the back of Cooky’s wagon is a large iron pan that can hold hot coals and even burning logs, allowing him to slow cook stew in a pot above the flames, even while travelling. Cooky has a hard time hearing most folk, although many of the others in the caravan think he can hear just fine and chooses to ignore others when they irritate him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.127,r=0.892,b=0.325), with ID 1ec32208-71ea-4af4-91dd-f5964680596c -->\n\n**Glunda Grapeleaf (N female gnome teamster):**\nBorn in heart of the Fangwood, Glunda has always had a strong tie to the beasts and plants of the world. When she was taken in by the druids in Crystalhurst, she developed her skills, even learning to speak with animals. Her time with the druids was not to last, for soon after the desire to wander called to her, and she left Nirmathas, joining up with Bort’s caravan to travel and see the world. Glunda regularly uses her rudimentary skills to speak to the pack animals and tend to their needs. She almost never talks to anyone other than Tamli and Bort unless absolutely necessary, preferring to sleep near the animals rather than gather round the fire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 4bd9a11a-ff3b-4e0a-8a1d-dadf52bfb9b8 -->\n\nOlf and Ulf Redfren (CG male human teamsters):\nHailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twin Ulfen brothers used to be part of a merchant vessel that plied the waters of Lake Encarthan, but when war came the region, the boat was sunk and the two barely made it to shore alive.

As Bort’s second in command, Tamli oversees the other staff and wagons in the train, making sure that all are in good spirits and good working order respectively. She is skilled at handling beasts of burden, but stern with the other members of the caravan. Her personal manner with outsiders and passengers are a bit brusque and awkward. She carries a lock of hair on a leather cord around her neck that’s from her son, who she lost years ago when she fled from Belkzen. She doesn’t like to talk about it with those she doesn’t trust. The only person she regularly confides in is Bort, although she can often be heard barking orders at the other members of the caravan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.695,r=0.891,b=0.938), with ID 47e2429b-70e4-4d0c-83c2-d29461592648 -->\n\n54 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.939,r=0.072,b=0.954), with ID 74afb75c-6990-45cc-8eca-5e569fa1d819 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.309,t=0.987,r=0.693,b=1.000), with ID 7dfece36-90f8-4c06-af52-548301769817 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.304,t=0.001,r=0.695,b=0.015), with ID 9c9fbe0d-798b-4509-9fbc-0345be0754e4 -->\n\nCHARACTER CREATION AND BACKGROUNDS\nThis adventure is designed for 1st-level characters, built using the rules found in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. In addition to the backgrounds presented in that book, the following are additional background options available to PCs at the start of the game to represent their ties to the world and the story that is unfolding in Isger and its neighboring countries. Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.118,r=0.455,b=0.390), with ID 8c16c9b0-b562-4d96-8d0a-79853cb8b10d -->\n\nLesser Scion  \nYou are the youngest child in a noble house (in Cheliax, Isger, or Andoran) and stand to inherit nothing from your family.

The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an _acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bottled lightning, frost vial_, or _thunderstone_). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.336,r=0.526,b=0.681), with ID 814e3cad-7f06-4db2-8c88-bda5de9672f4 -->\n\nENERGY MUTAGEN                                            ITEM 1+\n\nUNCOMMON  ALCHEMICAL  CONSUMABLE  ELIXIR  MUTAGEN  POLYMORPH\n\nUsage held in 1 hand; Bulk L  \nActivate ◆ Interact  \nWhen created, this mutagen is attuned to your choice of one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

Though he’s clearly mistaken,\nwhat is real is his apparent terror that minions of\nthe Whispering Tyrant have followed him to Etran’s\nFolly. In truth, Krent is partly correct. Talmore was\na fellow crusader in Lastwall and Krent’s close\nfriend, but when Lastwall fell, Krent left Talmore’s\nside during a fight to hide from the undead horde.\nWhen it was over, he searched the battlefield only\nto find his friend’s mangled body. Distraught, Krent\ntook Talmore’s holy symbol and fled. The incident\nweighs heavily on poor Krent, and he’s been running\never since. Now, the knight is seeing things, but while\nmost of his visions are simply manifestations of his\nshame and guilt, one is not. The ghost of Talmore is\nindeed haunting him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.601,r=0.453,b=0.862), with ID 843fa210-cfa3-482f-8a8a-692a4fbb66be -->\n\nFrom this point onward, Krent sees the PC as his long-lost friend, recounting old tales, apologizing for the time he left a scar on his face after accidentally cutting him during sparring practice, and asking how he managed to escape Lastwall.

If the ghost is defeated, he rematerializes after only a few days to continue haunting the holy symbol of Iomedae.

There might very well be other revelations in here, but those are left for you to decide based on the character’s backstory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.541,r=0.891,b=0.693), with ID 4500c418-b223-4f9f-80e4-584bc0f2711e -->\n\nThe silver amulet is an old family treasure. While\nit bears a faint aura of conjuration, it does not seem\nto have any powers, but the word “Karvasalon”\nis carved into the back. If someone wearing\nthe amulet casts a _planar ally_ ritual while\nspeaking that name, instead of what they\nwere intending to call, the amulet calls\na mysterious creature cloaked in\nshadows. This thing has served\nthe family for centuries, and\nalthough no one has called it\nin many years, it still answers the summons. The\ncreature refuses to say why, but when asked about\nthe arrangement, it merely states that it owes “an\neternal debt.” The exact statistics and abilities of\nKarvasalon are up to you to decide, as is the creature’s\n\ninline micro-figure: blue streak or magical effect appearing at the left margin, extending diagonally downward and rightward into the text. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.694,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID 8cc2f8e5-7f6f-4be4-95d8-9f0d6ecd9ae8 -->\n\n60 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.939,r=0.072,b=0.954), with ID debf6b18-65ac-4da0-95e0-1e0862c2955d -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animazuman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.309,t=0.988,r=0.692,b=1.000), with ID 46c2fa77-362e-4a6c-93dc-486759f6079e -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.305,t=0.001,r=0.693,b=0.015), with ID 9aa2a30b-2b0a-4383-98eb-0bc6ea87d97b -->\n\ntrue nature, but it should in some way speak to the\ncharacter’s backstory and history. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.159), with ID cad0f900-c32c-4b0f-8def-d7fd2f2eeab1 -->\n\nLast Delivery  \nBackground: Teamster  \nBort’s death has repercussions for the members of the caravan, including for any PC who works for the caravan, even if they are relatively new to the team. The most pressing challenges are being handled by Tamli and the others, but in going through Bort’s ledgers, she discovers that he still has one last delivery to make here in town. This side quest can occur at any time after Bort’s death, starting when Tamli comes to find them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.169,r=0.453,b=0.342), with ID eeef313a-f153-4b4a-932c-c2324c4e3e42 -->\n\nEmerging from the yard, you can see Tamli carrying something long and awkward wrapped in burlap.

Bort’s records for the delivery included a rather cryptic note that reads, “Make sure the mother doesn’t find out.” While Tamli does not quite know what this means, she trusts that the PCs will deliver the goods discreetly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.447,r=0.452,b=0.571), with ID a57791f9-2f6c-45c8-b331-92cc6d23c0fe -->\n\nIn truth, Pari wants the swords so that she can\nadvance her training. She hopes to leave this town\nsometime soon, hopefully as an adventurer. This has\nbeen her dream since she was little, when her older\nbrother died in the Goblinblood Wars, but the loss\nof her brother has made her mother paranoid and\nextremely overprotective of her only remaining child.\n  Getting out to the Hemsoth farm is not difficult,\nbut approaching it to make the delivery without\nbeing spotted by Pari’s mother takes a bit of ingenuity.\nThe PCs could simply use Stealth, but making it up\nto the farm without being seen requires succeeding\nat at least two consecutive DC 18 Stealth checks.\nFailure results in Elmora, the mother, storming out\nand demanding that the “vagrants” get off her farm\nat once. She does not want any adventurers talking\nto her daughter. Another option is for the PCs to\ntry distracting the mother with a Bluff, Diplomacy,\nor even Thievery check, making it much easier for\nsomeone else to sneak up. Ultimately, any reasonable\nplan should have a good chance of success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.573,r=0.452,b=0.888), with ID b2884804-0b78-4cb5-b158-68d30bcd7df9 -->\n\nOnce the PCs have found a way to deliver the\nswords, Pari is very grateful.

When the plague hit and the fiery priest of Gozreh blamed Silwyth, calling her a witch, most in town believed him. When the priest himself succumbed to the plague, most considered the matter closed. Since then, the town has been without a priest and his shrine has fallen into ruin, being used as a barn on the edge of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.247,r=0.818,b=0.417), with ID f2009756-c688-412e-bd1f-758d08748c1e -->\n\nIf the characters poke around the old church, an\naging dwarven farmer ambles up and asks what they\nwant with his barn.

Metmon is\na worshipper of Abadar, but he will be just as happy\nto see the church of any good or lawful neutral\ndeity established in town.

During this time, if one of the PCs helping Edfur is trained in Religion, the young dwarf becomes very curious about that PC’s faith, asking all sorts of questions and showing a genuine interest in the PC’s beliefs. If the PC engages with Edfur, he asks what he has to do to become a priest of the faith. He explains that if he can learn enough, he hopes to one day become the town’s priest, leading the people of Etran’s Folly in spiritual matters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.649,r=0.817,b=0.831), with ID 15df189b-67e3-40bb-a591-28148d465c0d -->\n\nHow this side quest comes to a conclusion is\nreally up to the PC. They can spend time with Edfur,\nteaching him about the faith, or they can send him\nto nearby Elidir for more formal training.

What starts as a simple investigation quickly turns sinister with the discovery of forbidden alchemy, mutant animals, and a nearby forest rotting away due to a mysterious blight. It becomes clear that if these heroes don’t intervene to stop whatever evil is brewing, the fall of Plaguestone is all but certain! The Fall of Plaguestone is the first standalone adventure for Pathfinder Second Edition, designed for 1st-level characters. It tells the story of how a group of strangers band together to form a group of adventurers while saving the town of Etran’s Folly from a terrifying fate, serving as a perfect introduction to a new Pathfinder campaign! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.001,r=0.856,b=0.240), with ID 4c395e64-ea2a-4603-a03e-8cdb368812d5 -->\n\nSummary : This is a fantasy-style illustration depicting three adventurers in a dense, mystical forest setting, with dramatic lighting and dynamic poses suggesting a tense or action-filled moment.\n\nphoto:  \nScene Overview :  \n  • Three armored and armed characters are present: one crouched in the foreground with a shield, one with long white hair in blue clothing to the left, and one standing on a rock in the background aiming a crossbow.  \n  • The setting is a lush, green forest with large, twisted tree roots and dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy.  \n  • The composition is dynamic, with the foreground character partially behind a wooden crate, the middle character turning toward the background, and the background character elevated and aiming a weapon.  \n  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and muted blues, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.\n\nTechnical Details :  \n  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.  \n  • The illustration style is painterly and detailed, typical of fantasy role-playing game art.  \n  • The lighting emphasizes the central action, with bright light streaming from the background and casting shadows in the foreground.\n\nSpatial Relationships :  \n  • The crouched character with a shield is in the immediate foreground, occupying the right side of the image.  \n  • The character in blue is positioned to the left, slightly behind the foreground figure, and appears to be reacting to the background character.  \n  • The standing character with the crossbow is in the background, elevated on a rock, and is the focal point of the other two characters’ attention.  \n  • Wooden crates and boxes are scattered in the foreground, suggesting a campsite or supply area.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The illustration conveys a moment of tension or confrontation, with the two foreground characters appearing surprised or defensive in response to the armed figure in the background.  \n  • The use of lighting and composition draws the viewer’s eye from the foreground action to the background threat, enhancing the sense of narrative and drama.  \n  • The setting and costumes suggest a high-fantasy adventure scenario, possibly from a game or graphic novel. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.246,r=0.998,b=0.682), with ID 35cdc92f-71ea-41f1-8ed6-1a34dd4d3e18 -->\n\nlogo: paizo\n\nPATHFINDER\n\npaizo.com/pathfinder <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.138,t=0.743,r=0.569,b=0.881), with ID 6f7c3cc0-5459-43c1-85df-750ec47f253d -->\n\nSummary : This image displays the barcode and publication details from the back cover of a book, including ISBN, price, and country of printing.\n\nbarcode:\nBarcode Details :\n  • ISBN: 978-1-64078-174-0.\n  • Numeric barcode (EAN-13): 9781640781740.\n  • Price: US $22.99.\n  • Additional barcode (5-digit add-on): 52299.\n  • Barcode type: EAN-13 with 5-digit supplemental (common for books).\n  • Barcode module count: Standard EAN-13 (13 digits) plus 5-digit add-on.\n  • Quiet zone: Present on both sides of the barcode.\n\nPlacement & Additional Text :\n  • \"Printed in China.\" appears in the lower right corner.\n  • All elements are on a white background, likely the back cover of a book.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The barcode and supplemental code conform to standard book publishing practices, allowing for retail scanning and price identification.

It even has hairs collected from her comb that he has lovingly placed on its head.",

When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.\n\n**Pharasma’s Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort’s boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well.",

He can often be found with a mug of ale in one hand and savory food in the other, telling some outlandish story about his travels, which generally involves him getting out of danger in the most ridiculous of ways (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar). He is slow to anger, quick to laugh, and more than capable of verbally dancing out of any danger.",

Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign.",

The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp.",

      "text": "Summary : This is a digital illustration of a fantasy plant creature, likely from a tabletop roleplaying game bestiary, depicting a menacing, animated vine with a bulbous, toothy head and leafy base.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a single, large, dark purple vine with a curved, serpentine stem.\n  • The vine terminates in a bulbous head with two fang-like protrusions, suggesting a predatory or carnivorous nature.\n  • The base of the vine is surrounded by a dense cluster of green leaves, indicating it is rooted in the ground.\n  • The background is white, with some partial text visible on the right, suggesting the image is cropped from a book or manual.\n  • The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the colour palette is dominated by dark purples, greens, and browns.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or explicit size reference is present.\n  • No visible text or labels within the illustration itself.\n  • The style is clean, digital, and semi-realistic, typical of modern fantasy bestiaries.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The vine's head is positioned in the upper left quadrant, curving downward and inward, drawing attention to its fanged mouth.\n  • The leafy base occupies the lower portion of the image, spreading horizontally.\n  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the vine's head and base occupying distinct visual zones.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration conveys a sense of threat and animation, suggesting the plant is capable of movement or attack.\n  • The exaggerated curvature and fanged head imply a creature designed for ambush or ensnaring prey.\n  • The dense foliage at the base contrasts with the stark, predatory head, emphasizing both its plant and monster characteristics.",

      "text": "Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration depicting three adventurers in a dense, mystical forest setting, with dramatic lighting and dynamic poses suggesting a tense or action-filled moment.\n\nphoto:  \nScene Overview :  \n  • Three armored and armed characters are present: one crouched in the foreground with a shield, one with long white hair in blue clothing to the left, and one standing on a rock in the background aiming a crossbow.  \n  • The setting is a lush, green forest with large, twisted tree roots and dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy.  \n  • The composition is dynamic, with the foreground character partially behind a wooden crate, the middle character turning toward the background, and the background character elevated and aiming a weapon.  \n  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and muted blues, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.\n\nTechnical Details :  \n  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.  \n  • The illustration style is painterly and detailed, typical of fantasy role-playing game art.  \n  • The lighting emphasizes the central action, with bright light streaming from the background and casting shadows in the foreground.\n\nSpatial Relationships :  \n  • The crouched character with a shield is in the immediate foreground, occupying the right side of the image.  \n  • The character in blue is positioned to the left, slightly behind the foreground figure, and appears to be reacting to the background character.  \n  • The standing character with the crossbow is in the background, elevated on a rock, and is the focal point of the other two characters’ attention.  \n  • Wooden crates and boxes are scattered in the foreground, suggesting a campsite or supply area.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The illustration conveys a moment of tension or confrontation, with the two foreground characters appearing surprised or defensive in response to the armed figure in the background.  \n  • The use of lighting and composition draws the viewer’s eye from the foreground action to the background threat, enhancing the sense of narrative and drama.  \n  • The setting and costumes suggest a high-fantasy adventure scenario, possibly from a game or graphic novel.",
