The town of Etran’s Folly has never had it easy.
Located far from popular trade routes, it has
never been more than a stopover point for
merchants making their way from Elidir to Almas.
Worse still, after the Goblinblood Wars, the town
suffered terribly from a plague outbreak that killed
almost half the population. Etran’s Folly never truly
recovered. This fact led many to refer to the town as
“Plaguestone”—a reference to a stone marker in town
once used to safely give food to the sick and dying.
Villagers left food at the stone and, in return, the sick
placed coins in a hole in the stone, filling the hole with
vinegar to cleanse the copper and silver of any trace
of the plague. Now, many of the town’s homes and
businesses are empty, their residents long dead save
for a few orphans taken in by neighbors or left to fend
for themselves on the fringes of the community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.187,r=0.456,b=0.448), with ID 2799d4cb-d7b8-4dca-98db-058269d4ee8e -->

When the plague came to Etran’s Folly, Silwyth Eldara did all she could with herbalism and alchemy to find a cure. Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran’s Folly for their treatment of her mother.

Over the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran’s Folly; stained by her mother’s reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone they where denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.448,r=0.456,b=0.817), with ID e713e247-1268-4d5c-9338-1dbe581baabf -->

ADVENTURE SUMMARY  
The adventure begins with the PCs traveling to Etran’s Folly in the caravan of Bort Bargith, a dwarf merchant who agreed to take them on as passengers. Just outside town, the caravan is attacked by a pack of wolves, the vicious leader of which spews acid. Arriving in town after helping to save the caravan, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.824,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID 3ababa81-09b2-4efe-bb75-fcfc526a474f -->

the characters are invited to dinner by Bort,
who wishes to reward them for their valor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.188,r=0.779,b=0.220), with ID 118dd76e-25c1-4424-a4b3-9080808c29f2 -->

While enjoying dinner with the PCs, Bort is
poisoned, dying within moments from a virulent
toxin hidden in his food. The local sheriff, Rolth
Garley, is out of his depth, and insists on holding the
caravan in town until the scheduled arrival of a circuit
judge a month in the future. But the heroes have a
chance to investigate the murder and they explore
the town, talking to everyone who was present for
the poisoning. Eventually, it becomes clear that
Phinick, the goblin kitchen assistant, poisoned the
food. He quickly confesses once apprehended, but
insists he thought he was only putting a special spice
in the food, not poison. Further questioning reveals
that Hallod, the town bully, coerced him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.220,r=0.820,b=0.433), with ID 18d606ed-8444-4705-b17b-b1d2dc54a865 -->

Hallod’s hideout reveals that he is more than he seems. The town bully is in fact an agent of Vilree, who pays him with gold and doses of an addictive mutagen. Defeating Hallod may help the town and clear the names of everyone involved with the merchant’s death, but it leads the heroes no closer to Vilree, who ordered the murder. In fact, Hallod hasn’t seen Vilree in over a year. The goods and supplies he acquired for her were always delivered to a prearranged drop spot in a hollow stump. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.434,r=0.820,b=0.587), with ID 64ef1e34-62a0-4f00-af0d-cc077431763a -->

About this time, Noala Kesrir, an elven ranger
that patrols the lands around town, contacts the
characters. She found the wolves slain earlier by
the PCs and noticed the taint affecting the corpses
is similar to a number of blighted areas that have
appeared in the woods near town. She seeks out the
characters, hoping they might help her investigate
these blighted areas. This leads them to the Pen, where
Vilree had been experimenting on animals and plants.
Shutting down this testing ground is dangerous, but in
doing so the PCs find a map that leads to Vilree’s lair,
a place known only as Spite’s Cradle. Only one of the
landmarks on the map is familiar, though: the hollow
stump where Hallod left supplies for Vilree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.587,r=0.820,b=0.801), with ID 0ce185d0-9b2d-49ce-908a-5a881da34999 -->

Using the map and information from Hallod, the group can make their way to Spite’s Cradle in the hills nearby. There, they learn of Vilree’s plot to infect the town with a terrifying plague. Worse still, the plague is already in town—hidden inside the plaguestone—and she has already sent a servant to trigger the explosion that will release the disease! After defeating the alchemist, the heroes must race back to town in time to save everyone from Vilree’s final revenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.802,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID b511c783-049e-488b-a6d0-0030d7c90631 -->

The adventure begins as the caravan travels south by southeast from Elidir, the capital of Isger, to Almas, the capital of Andoran, on a road between the Apsodell Mountains and the Five Kings range. There are faster and easier routes south, but for those seeking to avoid Cheliax, this is the safest. Bort Bargith is a dwarf trader from the Five Kings Mountains, welcome in many settlements for his fair prices and gregarious spirit, and he has been using this route for years. The caravan consists of six covered wagons, four of which are laden with supplies, trade goods, and trinkets. Bort makes his home in the lead wagon and the cabin built onto its back, while the final wagon is for passengers and the cook. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.570,r=0.526,b=0.786), with ID 10acd8db-3de6-4a87-b7b6-d2c210a0123a -->

The PCs are all passengers in this caravan, though
if one of them has the teamster background (page 55),
they might be working for it instead, driving the final
wagon. They share the last wagon with the food, the
camp chef Cooky, and a couple of other passengers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.786,r=0.524,b=0.862), with ID dc6949a4-94fe-4edc-b428-6c3badfc868b -->

The travelers do not necessarily know each other
at the start of the adventure, although some of them
could be acquainted. None of them are particularly
familiar with Bort, the caravan master, or any of
the other teamsters. The caravan is less than a day <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.862,r=0.524,b=0.940), with ID 21b21b59-0950-43b4-89a1-694522137405 -->

away from the town of Etran’s Folly and expects to  
arrive by nightfall so that the weary travelers can at  
least enjoy one night in town, sleeping in a real bed  
before pushing on to the next leg of the journey to  
Falcon’s Hollow. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.572,r=0.892,b=0.647), with ID 566745ce-64da-4091-9092-3f2877520822 -->

When you are ready to begin play, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.648,r=0.891,b=0.680), with ID 72fc4479-eac0-4fe9-b827-277f0e0c9ece -->

It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into the back of one of Bort Bargith’s wagons bound for the faraway Andoran capital of Almas. The smiling caravan master cut your travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise. Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.694,r=0.890,b=0.815), with ID f799014e-c65a-4b92-b074-188a1474f1cc -->

As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive at the town of Etran’s Folly by nightfall, and he promised a comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day’s travel. The caravan’s teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.817,r=0.890,b=0.940), with ID f628bdb7-5f1d-4ae1-92f2-a682ffbec9eb -->

At this point, allow the characters to introduce themselves to one another and describe their appearances. This is also a good time to briefly describe the other members of the caravan and the countryside through which they travel. For more information on the members of Bort’s caravan, see page 54. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.218), with ID f434504b-40ac-4458-8129-1204e856af9a -->

This part of Isger is sparsely populated, consisting of small rural farms and isolated communities. It is a temperate land, with frequent light rains and the rich smell of damp earth wafting on the pleasant breeze. The trail winds its way through the lowlands, passing along streams and through small forests. The game in this area has only recently recovered after years of war drove it into hiding. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.219,r=0.455,b=0.342), with ID 78e1ec6a-9ade-4067-a67e-b7697a72287c -->

If pressed about their behavior after Bort’s announcement, the teamsters quietly explain that the accommodations in Etran’s Folly are hardly better than the ground outside, and the smell is even worse. Except for Glunda, they all refer to the town as “Plaguestone” due to the virulent plague that nearly wiped out the community 20 years ago, although none are so rude as to use that name in front of the locals.

Late in the afternoon, the caravan is attacked! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.342,r=0.455,b=0.479), with ID fd5154ed-1162-4ea5-a0e7-dfc8fc5564d4 -->

A. MANGY PACK                              SEVERE 1

“Up ahead is Plaguestone,” Keldaran shouts from the front of the wagon. No sooner does the call fade from his lips than it is overshadowed by a series of long, mournful howls emanating from the woods to either side of the caravan. Moments later, you hear cries of panic as a pack of mangy wolves descends from the forest with teeth bared! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.490,r=0.454,b=0.638), with ID 92519ff3-f34f-4424-ab00-3e492d004ea5 -->

This attack occurs while the caravan is still a half an hour from town and far from aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.646,r=0.452,b=0.678), with ID 6087d318-5268-47dd-b6ad-e9514deb5a43 -->

**Creatures:** Although there are over a dozen wolves attacking the caravan, only three approach the wagon containing the PCs. At the end of the first round in which a mangy wolf is killed, the caustic wolf emerges from the forest to join the fight (roll Perception for its initiative as normal and insert it in the next round); it howls the moment it is near the characters. Once the caustic wolf is slain, all other wolves (including any fighting the PCs) flee into the woods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.679,r=0.454,b=0.818), with ID 52ce70bf-f7f2-4a96-b1f3-aba799d2e40b -->

FIRST FIGHT
As the battle with the wolves is the first
time the PCs have entered battle, it is important
to take your time and ensure that the combat
is fun and engaging. The mangy wolves do not
present much of a threat, but the caustic wolf is
a dangerous foe that can seriously hurt the player
characters. Fortunately, the wolves do not use
effective tactics. They do not intentionally move
into flanking positions, nor do they single out
weak characters. The caustic wolf uses his howl
early in the fight and his acid breath only once he
has been damaged. Should the fight turn against
the players, Olf and Ulf might show up to draw
the wolves off for a round or two, giving the PCs
a chance to regroup.

Most importantly, emphasize the sights,
sounds, and smells of the fight. The wolves snarl
with hunger and smell like filthy hounds. The mud
flies when characters charge across the damp
trail. Fangs tear nasty wounds, and warhammers
crunch bones. Play up any critical hits and
exaggerate the failures. Make sure everyone’s
first fight is one they will vividly remember. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.110,r=0.816,b=0.504), with ID 395e98f3-7651-4557-b0e9-2069dc84abbf -->

Summary : This is a gridded battle map illustration for tabletop role-playing games, depicting a forested road with two horse-drawn wagons and labeled areas.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map shows a winding dirt road running from the bottom center to the top right, surrounded by dense green forest.
  • The map is overlaid with a square grid; each square represents 5 feet, as indicated by the legend "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" in the bottom right.
  • The visible area covers approximately 13 squares wide by 18 squares tall (about 65 by 90 feet).

Keys & Annotations :
  • The label "MANGY PACK" appears in the upper left, likely indicating a location or encounter area.
  • Two wooden wagons are present: one near the center (with two horses and two drivers), and one further down the road (bottom center).
  • No compass rose or north arrow is visible, but the road curves from bottom center to top right.

Ordering :
  • The road curves gently, with a fork or path branching off to the upper right.
  • The wagons are positioned as if traveling northward/upward along the road.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical movement and encounter planning, with clear grid lines for measuring distance.
  • The dense forest on both sides of the road creates natural choke points and ambush opportunities.
  • The "MANGY PACK" label suggests a potential encounter or area of interest in the upper left section of the map. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.020,r=0.458,b=0.457), with ID 1858338e-42d8-41d6-b33e-c6a55059fe1c -->

Summary : This is a gridded battle map illustration titled "Old Orchard," depicting a top-down view of an orchard with a central dirt path, scattered trees, and a compass rose for orientation. The map is scaled for tabletop roleplaying games, with each square representing 5 feet.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a rectangular area divided into a grid, with each square labeled as 5 feet.
  • A compass rose in the lower right indicates cardinal directions (N, E, S, W).
  • The map is titled "OLD ORCHARD" in the upper left.

Keys & Annotations :
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" is noted in the lower right.
  • The central dirt path runs vertically from north to south, slightly winding.
  • Trees are scattered on both sides of the path, with more on the right (east) side.
  • The background is shaded in varying greens to indicate grassy terrain.

Ordering :
  • The path divides the map into two halves, with trees distributed irregularly on both sides.
  • The compass rose provides spatial orientation, with north at the top.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical movement and encounters, with the path serving as a central feature and trees providing cover or obstacles.
  • The grid and scale facilitate precise positioning for gameplay.
  • The distribution of trees is denser on the eastern side, potentially affecting line of sight or movement differently on each side of the path. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.469,t=0.004,r=1.000,b=0.455), with ID fc0d88a1-0370-447e-b256-7a3b9e79dadb -->

Summary : This is a top-down illustrated map of a rural property labeled "Trin's House," showing a house, outbuilding, paths, and adjacent farmland, with a grid overlay for scale.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • Geographic extent: A single rural property, including a house, outbuilding, paths, and a field.
  • Grid overlay: Each square represents 5 feet, providing a precise spatial reference.
  • No latitude/longitude or compass rose is shown.

Keys & Annotations :
  • Label in the top left: "TRIN'S HOUSE" marks the property.
  • Scale bar in the bottom right: "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET".
  • No legend or color key, but visual cues distinguish buildings, paths, and fields.

Features & Layout :
  • Main house: Central, L-shaped building with a red-brown roof, visible rooflines, and a small porch on the west side.
  • Outbuilding: Smaller rectangular structure to the east of the main house, with a visible door and a bench or trough.
  • Path: Light tan path runs north-south along the west side of the property, with a branch leading to the house entrance.
  • Farmland: Large brown rectangular field occupies the southeast quadrant, bordered by green grass and shrubs.
  • Vegetation: Green areas with trees and bushes surround the house and field, providing a natural boundary.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The house is north of the field, with the main entrance facing west toward the path.
  • The outbuilding is east of the house, separated by a grassy area.
  • The field is directly south and southeast of the house, occupying a significant portion of the property.
  • The path provides access from the north and south edges of the map.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tabletop role-playing or tactical use, with a clear grid for movement and distance measurement.
  • The property is organized with the house centrally located, easy access from the path, and farmland conveniently adjacent.
  • The presence of only two buildings and a single field suggests a small, self-contained homestead.
  • The grid and scale facilitate precise spatial planning or gameplay. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.467,r=0.997,b=0.997), with ID c833a799-601b-487e-98a9-cc70a0720c5e -->

as well. This affects additional enemies within 30 feet
of them and uses the caustic wolf’s Intimidation check
with a –4 circumstance penalty. Enemies cannot be
affected by the howl more than once, even if
they are near more than one howling wolf.
All creatures targeted by this effect are
temporarily immune for 24 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.126,r=0.449,b=0.234), with ID 415ed1b0-375e-441a-9948-16f7ec9c9601 -->

As they pass through the middle of town,
the wagons go around the ancient
plaguestone, a large, flat, cylindrical
rock standing 2 feet high, with a
hole in its center and a bowl-shaped
depression off to one side. When the
plague ran rampant, the townsfolk left
food for the sick in the bowl, while the
sick left coins in the center hole (which
was filled with vinegar to cleanse the
coinage of contamination). Today,
the stone is nothing more than a
moss-covered relic, although
the villain in this adventure
has deadly plans for it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.158,r=0.821,b=0.387), with ID 357257a1-8bde-4b4a-8b2e-de92d949d5db -->

After the Fight: Bort and Tamli inspect the caravan to make sure everyone is okay. When the wolves charged in, they spooked the horses pulling the wagons. While the teamsters kept them from bolting during the attack, the rear wagon was pulled several feet off the trail into the muck, making it nearly impossible to move. This had no effect on the fight itself, but it does prevent the wagon from moving on. Tamli discovers this problem and calls upon Olf, Ulf, and the PCs to find a solution. To get the wagon moving again, at least two PCs must help, although it will be easier if more assist. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.250,r=0.451,b=0.508), with ID c2e87467-67e5-4947-aff6-9026cddf7b76 -->

Everyone helping on this task must attempt a
DC 15 Athletics check. As long as two PCs succeed,
the wagon gets moving again without incident. If
fewer than two succeed, the wagon still gets moving,
but any PC that failed is fatigued by the effort. Anyone
that critically fails the check is fatigued as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.511,r=0.451,b=0.601), with ID ad502b87-6008-4c99-80aa-82a249737ce5 -->

Meanwhile, Bort checks on everyone’s health. Olf
and Ulf sustained minor injuries which they play up
as much more serious, but everyone seems to be alive
and well. Bort sees what the PCs accomplished and
thanks them profusely. He offers to buy them dinner
in town later as a reward and promises to regale
them with tales of his adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.602,r=0.451,b=0.709), with ID 1d4d06ce-cc8a-40bd-bf13-d34d7a4507ff -->

# ARRIVING IN ETRAN'S FOLLY
After dealing with the wolves and getting the wagon back on track, the caravan is free to continue to Etran’s Folly. The journey takes only an hour, and the wagons roll into town a few hours before dusk. All of the wagons head for the Feedmill, the only inn and tavern in the small community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.719,r=0.451,b=0.831), with ID 1722a5df-343b-4086-bd16-9ef64d46361f -->

Most of the simple wood-and-thatch homes in
Etran’s Folly look identical to one another and are in
a similar state of disrepair. A number of the houses
clearly look abandoned, their roofs collapsed. If the
characters ask about this, anyone in the caravan can
tell them the community suffered heavily from the
plague 20 years ago and has never fully recovered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.833,r=0.451,b=0.939), with ID f4c0fa65-79e8-4f2f-ae27-43d3223635e2 -->

Upon arrival, the
teamsters secure the caravan
for the night while Bort travels
around town to conduct business
with the crafters and families that call
Etran’s Folly home. This leaves the PCs to explore the
Feedmill and get to know some of the more colorful
members of the community. This would be a good
time to introduce the NPCs described on page 52;
become familiar with them so that you can represent
the townsfolk if the PCs talk to them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.389,r=0.818,b=0.556), with ID f877e27c-8805-4c19-94fe-6da603f3a310 -->

Notable Meetings  
The first character that the players are likely to meet is Edra Wythe, the stable hand at the Feedmill. She greets them when the caravan arrives and immediately worries about the condition of the horses. Soon after, the PCs meet Delma and the rest of the staff at the Feedmill. Notably, the goblin Phinick is particularly shy around newcomers, even if one of them is also a goblin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.569,r=0.817,b=0.693), with ID 78a0912c-0b46-40d1-a134-f908deb907d2 -->

The first time the characters enter the taproom of
the Feedmill, they find it empty of customers save
for Hallod—a gigantic, brutish human man. Phinick
is serving him food and drink, squeaking whenever
Hallod demands another round. PCs that try to talk
to Hallod find he has little to say aside from offering
curt, insulting replies. Shortly thereafter, he finishes his
meal and leaves. If anyone asks the staff about him,
they say that Hallod is a bit of a bully around town,
but it is simple enough to stay out of his way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.694,r=0.817,b=0.847), with ID 3d93205f-c5f6-4453-982f-63041c563115 -->

Event 1. Bar Brawl                Moderate 1
In the early evening, Bort returns to the Feedmill and invites the characters to supper. He has reserved a table upon the dais next to Flonk, the town’s bard, who is tuning his instrument just as the meal is served. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.860,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID bfce52d5-3b34-404c-b3f7-d1b3a73a408d -->

SETTING UP THE MYSTERY
Bort’s poisoning is a mystery central to this adventure, and for everything to go as planned, you should ensure a certain amount of chaos and confusion in the moments leading up to his death. The bar fight, no matter how short, is a distraction that ensures the PCs lose track of the various suspects. It’s particularly important who is present and who goes missing during the fight and its aftermath.
  Present for Dinner: Feedmill staff (Amora, Delma, Kolnral, Phinick, Trin), town locals (Farmer Eallom, Flonk the Bard, Sir Lawren, 14 local farmers), caravan members (Bort, Olf, Ulf), the player characters.
    Leaves During the Fight: Delma, Sir Lawren, Phinick, Trin.
    Arrives After the Fight: Rolth Garley, Tamli; Delma returns with Rolth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.101,r=0.524,b=0.419), with ID e80a9533-9e8f-4dee-8726-508a89105bb0 -->

The rest of the Feedmill is full of local farmers, as well as a few notable characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.431,r=0.526,b=0.464), with ID a66c81ca-5e20-4812-86a9-9552490107ae -->

Kolnral and Trin are serving the guests tonight,
while Delma tends bar and Amora is busy in the
kitchen. Phinick can be seen doing odd jobs all over,
but once dinner begins, he spends most of his time
helping Amora in the kitchen. By the time dinner
starts, Sir Lawren is deep into his cups, leaning back
dangerously in his chair, while Farmer Eallom is busy
gambling and getting drunk with Olf and Ulf. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.464,r=0.526,b=0.586), with ID 7f65693e-95cf-42ae-bbcc-d181d4699b3c -->

As the first dishes come out (wild game and roasted turnips with a side of burnt seed cake, coupled with watery turnip ale), Bort is busy asking the PCs where they are from and where they are going, and telling some of his fabulous tales (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar on page 54). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.587,r=0.525,b=0.678), with ID d9521200-54ff-4bfd-9c42-1926918742dc -->

**Creature:** Toward the end of the meal, just as a dessert of warm turnip porridge is being served, Kolnral accidentally bumps into Farmer Eallom as he is sitting down with another ale, causing the farmer to spill all over himself. Eallom stands up and starts yelling at poor Kolnral. Seconds later, Eallom begins throwing punches and knocking over tables, and a bar fight erupts in the common area of the tavern. For this encounter, you might want to refresh yourself on the rules for nonlethal attacks on page 453 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.679,r=0.525,b=0.847), with ID 89258301-5fdc-4a0b-a0fe-bafe0e521f49 -->

During the fight, the entire common area of the
Feedmill turns to chaos as a dozen drunken farmers
wind up in a gigantic brawl. Treat the entire common
room as difficult terrain, as it is filled with patrons,
knocked over chairs, and other debris. How the
players decide to get involved is up to them. The
farmers mostly fight with fists, but the occasional
chair or mug is thrown as well. If the characters can
pacify at least three drunk farmers, the fight ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.310,r=0.893,b=0.448), with ID 46e08d43-20a5-460e-8e2d-c7a73162a008 -->

Several things happen during the fight, which will
be important later. Sir Lawren slips out the front
door while Phinick runs out the back through the
stables. Delma leaves immediately to fetch the sheriff.
Bort, meanwhile, tries to calm things down, but gets
a chair thrown at him for his trouble. Trin gets hit
with a mug in the first moments of the fight and flees
through the stables to find her brother. Meanwhile,
the taproom turns to chaos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.449,r=0.892,b=0.585), with ID 5b043a0a-87df-4910-8393-aea800310445 -->

One minute later (10 combat rounds), or as soon as the PCs bring the fight to an end, Delma returns with Rolth Garley, the town’s sheriff, who takes all the offending farmers to a table in the corner for a stern talking to (this is about all the offense warrants and, besides, the town has no jail). If anyone was dealt lethal wounds during the fight, they pull through thanks to Delma’s skill at Medicine, although the sheriff has strong words for anyone who resorted to such tactics on mostly helpless farm folk. If the characters try to help after the fight is over, Rolth half-heartedly thanks them for their assistance, but dismissively tells them that their help is no longer needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.587,r=0.892,b=0.801), with ID 986d40f2-1062-4b4f-a637-c6f56c35cc9c -->

A Meal to Die For
After the brawl, Bort invites the characters back to the table to finish their meal and enjoy a round of drinks. Dessert was served before the fight began, and Bort proclaims to all that the turnip porridge here is his favorite, which explains the extra large bowl of it sitting before him. In fact, his bowl is unique in more ways than one—it's also poisoned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.813,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID 776d32c6-7c9b-446b-81a7-d121db714cb1 -->

Poisoned Dessert: Just a few minutes into his dessert, Bort begins to cough and choke. Playing this off as a bit of indigestion, he continues whatever tale he was in the middle of telling. A few moments later it is clear, as the coughing returns, that he is in distress. He begins to turn purple and his mouth begins frothing. Seconds after, his eyes roll into his head and a rumble can be heard in his guts. Mere moments thereafter, he collapses onto the table and dies. The characters might attempt to aid him using Medicine. A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Medicine check determines that Bort is not choking on anything, but that his windpipe has swollen shut, indicating that he has been poisoned. Allow an extra Medicine check to use Treat Poison (against the virulent poison’s DC of 24) to help Bort attempt his Fortitude save to resist, but the amount put in his porridge is just too great, and even if his throat is somehow opened so he can breathe, he still fails every save against the poison and dies (22 Hit Points, Fortitude Save +6). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.454,b=0.433), with ID bc16202e-6976-41ec-809d-1260298b1858 -->

Fortunately for the PCs, should any of them
accidentally ingest some of the poison, only trace
amounts remain in the bowl. Treat any trace ingestion
as the poison outlined below, but the maximum
duration is only 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.434,r=0.453,b=0.510), with ID aea88c77-dbc2-472f-b41e-f56df8e63494 -->

Bort’s death happens so quickly that no one
in the Feedmill has a chance to react. After Bort
collapses, townsfolk gather round to see what all
the commotion is about. A few rounds later, Delma
and Rolth make their way to the table to see what is
happening. As they witness the PCs trying to help,
it’s clear the PCs were not responsible, but at first,
everyone is just concerned for the dwarf’s well-being.
Once it’s clear he is dead, the tavern goes silent, and
everyone begins eyeing one another (and their food). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.663,r=0.452,b=0.816), with ID 87a11ddd-2816-4ae4-bf1c-9d1ae57f43f7 -->

Rolph’s Investigation  
As the town’s only real member of law enforcement, Rolth Garley is incompetent. He is the mayor’s nephew and rarely does anything other than settle disputes over livestock and break up the occasional drunken brawl. In fact, the town has not had a crime reported in years, so when Bort dies, Rolth realizes he’s in over his head. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.829,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID 9f75c513-a260-45e4-b67c-ac724609d3bc -->

The sheriff’s first inclination is to cover the body, take everyone at the table and all the members of the caravan out to the stables, and talk to each person in turn about what happened. Although he is privately hoping someone will give him a clue, he is honestly just hoping to gain a better idea of what happened. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.126,r=0.815,b=0.249), with ID 5e0afa2c-6719-474d-8b33-542f301344e8 -->

Though he can’t be certain, hearing that the PCs
tried to help the Bort, combined with the fact that
they hardly knew him, convinces the sheriff that they
are unlikely to be responsible. The members of the
caravan who would inherit the lucrative business are
high on the list of suspects, but most were not in the
bar, and those that were—Olf and Ulf—have solid
alibis: they were drinking and gambling with Eallom
before and after the fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.250,r=0.818,b=0.387), with ID 076b207a-f420-4674-a5fb-e65b92484f23 -->

Feel free to modify this interrogation according to
the actions of the players. Rolth grants requests that
are likely to further the investigation, but he will not
start questioning other townsfolk until he has first
interrogated the PCs and other caravan members. He
is not willing to hold everyone in the bar; he’s certain
they won’t be leaving town anytime soon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.388,r=0.818,b=0.494), with ID dacf3a42-5cfd-4740-9de8-5ba438060386 -->

In the meantime, Delma closes the kitchen and sends most of the other townsfolk home, including her staff (although Trin and Phinick are already gone). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.495,r=0.816,b=0.540), with ID 3f26c2c7-f9fe-4981-8ea1-29761c8cf8f5 -->

Upon finishing his questioning, Rolth realizes that there is no clear suspect, and that no member of the caravan can be ruled out. As the town has no jail, he informs everyone he will need to turn this investigation over to a circuit judge who visits the town occasionally to deal with serious legal matters and crimes. Unfortunately, the judge, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, is not due back for another month, so everyone is stuck here until then. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.541,r=0.817,b=0.677), with ID fd2aea25-f08e-4f07-a305-8480f181d330 -->

If the PCs protest, Rolth insists that unless he
knows who committed this heinous crime, he is
bound to hold all possible suspects until the judge
arrives. He does add that if the characters assist in
the investigation, it might be resolved sooner. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.679,r=0.818,b=0.755), with ID 629d437e-981b-406b-b75f-0f81611f57e5 -->

TRACKING DOWN THE KILLER  
After Rolth orders the caravan to remain in town, everyone heads home. Bort’s body is taken down to the cellar to be kept cool, while Tamli and the rest of the caravan gathers to mourn. She invites the characters to join them out near the wagons. This is a somber occasion, and everyone in the company is at a loss. Bort was their leader, and without him, their future is uncertain. Tales of remembrance are told through teary eyes, and rare bottles of elven wine from Kyonin are passed around for all to share. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.765,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID a69d0a4a-a77f-40b0-a40c-a174a0a89e47 -->

Tamli remains mostly quiet through this, but speaks
up at the end of the night, just as the sun begins to rise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.160), with ID 3735ca13-001d-4a68-83f3-8fd5eafcd609 -->

“Bort was more than just a merchant, more than just the boss. He was my friend. We won’t leave here until we’ve found out who did this. Rolth’s a fool, but I’d be an even greater fool if I thought I could get to the bottom of this. Fixing wagons and moving goods, that’s my job. But you,” she says, pointing at all of you, “you might be able to figure out who killed Bort and get justice for him.” She holds back tears as she says, “For all of us. Will you help uncover who did this?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.171,r=0.525,b=0.311), with ID 1b3a1f63-3ef1-44a6-b1c4-96d2e1dd10ca -->

Assuming that the characters agree, they can investigate Bort’s murder in several ways. They can search the Feedmill for clues, they can go through Bort’s ledgers, and they can talk to various witnesses and suspects around town. Each of these approaches is described below. Although there is plenty of time before the circuit judge arrives, Tamli and the other caravan members instill a sense of urgency. No one wants to remain in this town an hour longer than they have to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.326,r=0.524,b=0.464), with ID 6802fd22-332e-43d3-b931-8d1246926b13 -->

Searching the Feedmill  
One of the obvious places to start the investigation is the Feedmill itself. After the events of the previous night, the common room was tidied up a bit, but the kitchen is in complete disarray. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.476,r=0.524,b=0.555), with ID 85ca6528-d479-4047-8ae3-2be6780255ec -->

**Dining Room:** There is little to be found here that relates to Bort’s death. The poisoned bowl was taken to the kitchen, and there is nothing remarkable about the table or chair where Bort perished. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.556,r=0.523,b=0.617), with ID 264a0a66-1c79-4c5d-b38f-a327f5a0f3d7 -->

Kitchen: The kitchen contains the cooking utensils needed to operate the Feedmill—kettles, skillets, knives, a mortar and pestle, roasting spits, a sieve, and a butter churner. Of particular note is the kettle of turnip porridge sitting on the counter, next to Bort’s large bowl. Although the remnants are starting to dry out, a PC who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check notices an unusual, faintly floral, smell in the porridge remaining in Bort’s bowl. Checking all the herbs in the kitchen doesn’t uncover a match, nor is the smell similar to that of ground clove and anise in the mortar and pestle that was used to spice the dishes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.618,r=0.523,b=0.800), with ID 52306256-9fd3-40fb-9e1b-fed8d36be86c -->

**Cellar:** Down in the cellar, alongside a number of large casks of ale and a few old, dusty bottles of wine, is the body of Bort Bargith. His flesh has turned an odd blue color in death, and anyone checking gets the faintest impression of a floral odor from the body. There is nothing else here to be learned that could not be uncovered when he was dying. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.802,r=0.523,b=0.907), with ID d5f44908-2e29-4d4d-a0a2-8e23124de529 -->

**The Grounds:** There is not much to be gained searching the grounds. There is no sign that anyone <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.183,t=0.909,r=0.524,b=0.939), with ID ed18e541-bb48-4fd3-8a08-0a9929b71093 -->

unexpected was present. Searching the yard outside the
barn does reveal one very important clue: a PC who
succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check spots a glint
in the grass just outside the stable doors, leading to a
small glass vial with a simple cork. The vial is empty
but contains traces of a floral-smelling liquid. This is
the vial that Phinick used to season Bort’s porridge, and
he dropped it here when he fled during the bar brawl. If
the PCs do not uncover this, Edra finds it two days later
and gives it to them, hoping to assist their investigation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.128,r=0.891,b=0.280), with ID 6a0fb8f2-df57-4da9-912e-d7c18eb1723b -->

### BORT’S BOOKS
The players might think to check through Bort’s belongings and papers for clues as to why someone might want to murder him. Tamli has the keys to Bort’s wagon and will let the PCs inside, but she will not tolerate them ransacking the place. She remains very protective of Bort’s memory and reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.293,r=0.891,b=0.401), with ID ed218b99-e047-4de2-854e-e9c3f84ebbe9 -->

Inside, Bort’s wagon is filled with knickknacks and keepsakes from his journeys. His belongings are truly a bewildering assortment of odds and ends, including a bottle with a tiny skull floating in oil, a taxidermic dragon whelp, a mummified owlbear paw, a shining crystal that holds the illusionary image of a mountain peak inside, and so on. There are a number of minor magic trinkets in here, but Tamli will not allow the players to take or examine these at all. The merchant’s ledgers are easily found in a rack above his bed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.404,r=0.890,b=0.554), with ID d7fa67fc-1606-4259-9bbf-f537f2043d1a -->

The books are large and filled to the brim with details about his travels and transactions over many years. Acquiring any useful information from them takes at least 4 hours and requires a successful DC 18 Decipher Writing check (using Society or a related Lore skill). A PC who succeeds at this check uncovers that Bort visited Etran’s Folly at least 22 times in the past decade, and about five years ago the merchant started making deliveries labeled “reagents” to someone referred to only as “H,” receiving rather large sums of gold in exchange. These deliveries are numbered, starting with 1 and ending with delivery number 14, which occurred the day the caravan arrived in town. If the PCs fail to decipher the ledger, they can try again until they find what they are looking for. Each attempt takes 4 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.557,r=0.890,b=0.799), with ID 322ad1b9-36e2-48b6-8eee-4ca460de1027 -->

**XP Award:** If the PCs uncover the deliveries made to the mysterious “H,” award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.801,r=0.889,b=0.831), with ID 623f41e6-33c4-4b34-a358-1f0daee010c4 -->

Questioning Amora                Trivial 1
After Bort’s death, Amora tells Delma that the kitchen should be closed immediately, just in case it was the food. Proud of her work, the cook insists Bort’s death must be foul play because, she explains, simple food poisoning doesn’t work that fast and isn’t as deadly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.845,r=0.890,b=0.939), with ID 52cf66a4-8528-4a80-bcf1-e8461dc776e8 -->

Delma agrees, but insists that nothing in the kitchen
be cleaned or removed, so that investigators can look
for clues and clear Amora’s good name.
Removing her apron, Amora heads
home and does not return for as long
as the investigation continues. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.125,r=0.457,b=0.220), with ID 50ef26f2-df40-4f77-b9a0-6b72861ae7ce -->

armor—to protect her from the bees—
armed with a smoke can to pacify any
bees that remain. She invites the PCs to
her home, offering up remedies for any
stings they might have suffered. She
also serves delicious biscuits with
honey harvested from the beehive.

When talk turns to Bort’s murder,
Amora says that she prepared the
dessert, Phinick plated it and Trin
served it. She doesn’t think anyone else
was in the kitchen, even though she went
out more than once to empty the slop
bucket. Amora is terribly worried about her
image, and she seems to care more about
her reputation around town than
about the dead dwarf. If taken
back to the kitchen, she confirms
that nothing there seems out of the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.437,t=0.128,r=0.823,b=0.415), with ID 3099dde5-8234-4738-9c9e-fed7ae6fb4c3 -->

B. THE OLD ORCHARD  
If the characters go looking for Amora, townsfolk can tell them she lives in the Old Orchard, an area just outside town that was once a productive apple orchard. These days, it is foul and rotten, the trees having taken on a sickness. After the trees went bad a few years back, the grove’s tender moved with his family to Almas, and Amora lives in the small shack they left behind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.229,r=0.393,b=0.418), with ID a07f33e7-7f79-4af8-a540-5e356dcfd1d7 -->

Creatures: Unless care is taken to travel around the outside of the orchard, the PCs are likely to pass near a tree containing a gigantic beehive. The bees do not take well to intruders, and if anyone comes within 30 feet, the bees swarm and attack. Although they can be defeated conventionally, any player who asks can use an action to attempt a DC 12 Nature check; if successful, the PC knows that bees are pacified by smoke. If anyone uses a smokestick or similar item against the bee swarm, the swarm dissipates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.419,r=0.455,b=0.587), with ID 2dab5381-0cd4-49ed-8550-f1c8f9a5e45b -->

Questioning Delma  
As the owner of the Feedmill, Delma knows much about its operations and the staff that work there, but her knowledge of the evening of the poisoning is limited to what she saw in the taproom, which isn’t much. She knows where every one of her staff lives, except for Phinick; she knows only that he sleeps in the barn sometimes. She is steadfast in her conviction that no one in her employ had any ill will toward Bort, and the thought of any of them randomly poisoning the dwarf is absurd. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.479,r=0.818,b=0.644), with ID c5a0f62f-30bd-4da1-b8f0-3933fb2e103a -->

The day after the murder, probably after they have
finished up a day investigating, Delma seeks out the
PCs to talk to them about their bill. She is happy
for them to stay at the Feedmill, but they will have to
pay for room and board. While this is not costly
(only about 5 sp per day), she offers them a greatly
reduced rate of only 2 sp per day if they assist her
with a few chores around the shop and town. In
particular, she would like some help with her aging
father Targen, the mayor of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.649,r=0.818,b=0.801), with ID 65d74303-261f-4064-b866-e9301b07ae03 -->

Event 2. Tour of Etran’s Folly  
For years now, octogenarian Targen Fulst has been unable to walk for more than a few feet under his own power. His eyesight failing, he spends most of his days in a wooden wheelchair made from a modified pushcart. Delma lives next door and does what she can to care for her father, but with all that’s happening at the Feedmill, she would like the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.814,r=0.818,b=0.939), with ID 541e9209-65be-4b6b-b3db-e01f7e82df56 -->

Assuming the characters agree, Targe
takes them to visit the following sites
around town, talking to them all the
while about the town’s history and
its people. The path starts at the
Feedmill and visits the following
locations in order. Targen knows a
great deal of common information
about these sites (as described on
page 51) and any town history
surrounding them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.158,r=0.489,b=0.325), with ID a3f71fe5-b036-4b3d-9b01-7e443e5ab633 -->

The Feedmill: Targen is proud to talk about the Feedmill, the town’s only major business. Targen opened the Feedmill more than 50 years ago, before the Goblinblood Wars. His brother died in that conflict, along with much of Targen’s extended family. The town itself avoided the worst of the conflict, which occurred primarily to the west. If there are any goblins in the party, Targen gives them a wary glance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.326,r=0.530,b=0.495), with ID 58c5425a-f5ee-4862-8c38-a1d56c8c5dfe -->

**Plaguestone:** The path next leads to the plaguestone, which was used to give food and aid to those suffering from the plague. Targen can tell the PCs much about the plague that came to Etran’s Folly. He recounts how everyone suspected a local witch named Silwyth of starting the plague (she was actually an alchemist, but Targen has no idea what that is), and after Silwyth caught it herself, she cursed the town’s only priest before she died. Soon after, Father Bolgrist contracted the plague and died. Targen tells the PCs that the witch had a daughter named Vilree who stuck around her mother’s home for a few years, then probably died or ran off. Targen does not bother to recount the fact that Silwyth tried to stop the plague, or that Father Bolgrist was the first to accuse Silwyth of spreading it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.495,r=0.525,b=0.724), with ID 52003e81-9e1b-4aec-8d21-f5efca2530fb -->

**Dead Homes:** After visiting the plaguestone, Targen guides the PCs through the north side of town where most of the plague victims lived. Most of their homes are empty and in a terrible state of disrepair. Only the very poor or desperate call this part of town home. Targen notes that anyone with coin lives on the south side of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.725,r=0.524,b=0.832), with ID af5036c0-1b54-4fd3-94d9-2a3172dd63d4 -->

**Drunk Shepherd’s Path:** Leaving the north side of town, Targen wants to be walked along this old shepherd’s path that wanders through the turnip farms around town.

Targen Fulst

Targen notes as the group wanders through the old woods that while the shrine is currently dedicated to Gozreh, it has served other purposes. He claims that druids used to gather at the shrine long ago. Since Father Bolgrist’s death, nobody worships here anymore. Unfortunately, the area is overrun by wilderness, and the shrine is home to a group of hungry bloodseekers (see Creatures in area C below).

**Etran’s Hill:** On the way back home, the path leads past Etran’s Hill. Looming to the town’s southeast, this hill was the site of the first home built in the area. Targen notes that Etran spent his fortune founding the town, only to die in a fire that consumed him and his family because the house was too far away from the well and the river. This is how Etran’s Folly got its name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.459,t=0.128,r=0.894,b=0.464), with ID 874c5504-8a32-49fa-8cd0-c1b083a673d7 -->

**Back Home:** The path leads back to the Feedmill. Targen nods off and naps for the last leg of the journey, and upon arriving home, he complains that it took too long and he is late for lunch.

Questioning Edra  
Edra is easy to find, as she lives at the Feedmill and is always around, taking care of the animals and making sure the stables are in good condition. On the night of the poisoning, Edra was busy in the stables with Glunda, tending to Bort’s horses; Glunda can confirm this. When the fight broke out, she saw Phinick flee right away, and she saw Trin leave through the stable doors soon after, clutching a wound on her cheek. She was nowhere near the food or the poisoning. Edra knows that Phinick some <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.769,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID c14caf8a-ef57-4d52-a0a6-cdf415ac6acc -->

Two days after the murder, unless the PCs
uncover it first, Edra finds the poison vial in
the yard just outside the stable doors (as
noted in Searching the Feedmill on page
10). She gives this to the PCs at her earliest
convenience, hoping it will aid their
investigation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.158,r=0.423,b=0.264), with ID 110c01e3-69b3-4831-8200-a32aa40b1006 -->

**Helping the Horses:** After the fight with the wolves, Bort’s horses have all become infested with biting fleas. Edra is doing what she can to help them, but she needs an entire bushel of rosemary to brew up enough ointment to treat this many animals. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.265,r=0.401,b=0.357), with ID b9a410e1-1905-42eb-8583-79a8b27bb563 -->

D. ROSEMARY BUSHES     MODERATE 1
The day after the poisoning, Edra asks the
PCs if they could bring her some rosemary
to help her take care of the horses. She
knows a spot in the woods nearby that
is thick with the plants. Unfortunately, it
is also the home of a rather ferocious old
bear that tends to sleep among the bushes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.369,r=0.405,b=0.493), with ID 4246cf8c-0dc3-4702-b896-8a24b370d6c1 -->

Summary : This is an illustration of a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat with a stalk of wheat or similar plant tucked into the hatband, depicted in a stylized, possibly fantasy or adventure-themed art style.

photo:  
Scene Overview :  
  • Main subject is a person shown from the shoulders up, facing left, wearing a tan or beige wide-brimmed hat with a dark brown band.  
  • A stalk of wheat or similar plant is tucked into the hatband, extending upward and to the left.  
  • The illustration uses muted, earthy tones (tan, brown, green).  
  • The background is plain white, with some adjacent text and a green nameplate partially visible at the bottom.  

Technical Details :  
  • The image is a digital illustration, not a photograph.  
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.  
  • The nameplate at the bottom reads "Ernest Fallen" (partially visible).  

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The hat and wheat stalk are the most prominent features, occupying the upper half of the image.  
  • The subject is positioned slightly off-center to the right, with the hat brim extending to the left.  
  • The lower part of the image is partially obscured by a rectangular overlay.  

Analysis :  
  • The illustration emphasizes the character's hat and the wheat stalk, suggesting a rural, explorer, or adventurer archetype.  
  • The muted color palette and stylized rendering contribute to a fantasy or role-playing game aesthetic.  
  • The presence of a nameplate implies this is a character portrait, likely for use in a game or story context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.495,r=0.564,b=0.802), with ID a8581420-cd42-4385-a6f1-99513dafdb94 -->

Questioning Farmer Eallom
Farmer Eallom can be found in his fields
most days and in the taproom of the Feedmill
most nights. He is in a foul mood each
morning as he recovers from the excess of
the past evening. He is less hostile to visitors
in the afternoons, but even on the best of days
the farmer is not friendly. His farm is on the
north side of town and is easily mistaken for
being abandoned, as it isn’t in good repair.
Eallom’s memory of the night of the murder
(as with most any night) is a bit hazy. He
remembers getting into a fight with “that clumsy
fool Kolnral,” and he recalls talking to Rolth, but
he has little to say about Bort. He was gambling
and drinking with Olf and Ulf before and after the
fight, and he is still quite bitter about the amount
of coin they won from him that night. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.417,t=0.127,r=0.804,b=0.405), with ID 72e179e0-86c7-4570-939f-0391e97956a0 -->

## QUESTIONING FLONK
Flonk can be found around town during
the afternoon and in the tavern at night. In
either case, he is busy performing—badly.
The bard has little to offer the characters. Before
the brawl, he was both drinking and performing,
and any information he offers is likely to conflict
with other accounts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.416,r=0.802,b=0.539), with ID 91d070a2-1c10-4db1-a4ae-bba376db89fa -->

Questioning Kolnral  
Kolnral lives not far from the Feedmill with his wife and newborn daughter. After the poisoning, he can be found at home, recovering from the injuries suffered during the bar brawl. He is happy to talk to the PCs about the night of Bort’s poisoning. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.560,t=0.554,r=0.799,b=0.677), with ID 906ab3fe-54c5-48ee-8ea7-53ecb416ecaf -->

Eallom

Kolnral confirms that he served drinks while Trin served the food. He also can confirm that Amora was busy in the kitchen while Phinick assisted around the bar and kitchen. Most of his interactions that night were with Delma, as she prepared drinks for him to serve to thirsty guests. The last thing he clearly recalls is accidentally bumping into Eallom, which caused the farmer to spill his drink and start the brawl. When Kolnral was knocked to the floor, he saw Phinick fleeing the bar, but the rest is a blur. He regained his senses shortly after Bort’s death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.465,t=0.678,r=0.799,b=0.894), with ID 6f7f9677-1aec-423e-b175-ee4b70b2cf33 -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated table of contents for an adventure module, featuring a fantasy-themed border with alchemical and magical motifs, and a list of adventure sections.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical parchment-like scroll bordered by purple, waxy, organic shapes with glowing orange stars and fantasy plant elements.
  • At the top, a purple flower and a green potion bottle are integrated into the border.
  • At the bottom, a small vial and a glowing orange star are embedded in the waxy border.
  • The parchment contains a list of adventure sections in white and black serif text.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is clearly legible and centered on the parchment.
  • The illustration uses a palette of purples, greens, and golds, with highlights of orange.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The parchment is vertically oriented, with the border elements framing the content.
  • The text is centered within the parchment, with decorative elements at the top and bottom.

Text Content :
  • Part 1: A Mysterious Murder
  • Part 2: The Ranger’s Request
  • Part 3: Into Vilree’s Lair
  • Adventure Toolbox

Analysis :
  • The illustration is designed to evoke a magical, mysterious atmosphere appropriate for a fantasy adventure.
  • The decorative border and potion motifs reinforce the alchemical or magical theme.
  • The table of contents is clearly organized into three main parts and a toolbox section, suggesting a structured adventure narrative. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.798,t=0.090,r=0.998,b=0.761), with ID eb917353-7197-4191-840c-0e792244745f -->

after an entire day missing, Delma and the others
at the Feedmill note his absence as being unusual. If the
PCs ask others why he left during the brawl, they learn
that he frequently flees the tavern during fights because
he is often the target of a thrown mug or, worse still,
someone picks him up and throws him at someone else. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.127,r=0.524,b=0.218), with ID dd7114ad-c6ef-41e6-8a4b-146c6cd6bc4a -->

The truth is that Phinick fled from the brawl, but he
soon learned of Bort’s death and became afraid that
the spice he was bullied into putting into the porridge
was poison. The goblin fears he’s responsible for the
dwarf’s murder and is terrified of what the townsfolk
might do to him if they find out. The fact that he
was forced to add the spice, and that he had no idea
what it actually was, does little to ease his concern,
so he spent several days in hiding just trying to figure
out what to do. Finding Phinick is not an easy task.
No one seems to know where the goblin stays, and
searching every building would take a week or more. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.219,r=0.524,b=0.402), with ID 91bddcc7-3c12-4b67-8bde-0e482de14cbc -->

Phinick hides in a small shack in the woods and in one of the abandoned homes on the north side of town, and does not come out of hiding until two days have passed, when his food supplies have run low. He has no intention of talking to anyone, and he hopes to sneak back to the Feedmill, get some food, and continue hiding until this whole mess is a distant memory. The PCs run across him as he is making his way between houses on his way to the Feedmill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.403,r=0.523,b=0.540), with ID ac26f6ab-ea03-41a0-a8aa-68c1daabc57b -->

Chasing Phinick                Severe 1
Once spotted, Phinick assumes he’s being blamed for Bort’s death and runs off to avoid the PCs. To keep things simple, the PCs each take turns attempting to pass each location, in order. On a PC’s turn, they must attempt one of the listed checks for each location or give up the chase. Each success earns the PC 1 point toward catching Phinick, while a critical success awards 2. If a PC fails a check, they suffer the listed drawback (if any). Either way, the PCs move on to the next location. A PC who accumulates 4 points catches Phinick at that location, and if no PC gains 4 points after attempting checks at all five locations, Phinick escapes. Turns don’t correspond to time; a PC with more points reaches new locations before a PC with fewer points, but once the chase is over, the rest of the PCs catch up. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.552,r=0.524,b=0.800), with ID 2ef094f2-3e72-4eec-a2d9-cd913f86df8b -->

If the PCs fail to catch Phinick before he crosses the turnip field, he leaps across the stream and disappears into the woods around town and does not resurface for at least a day. This might lead to another chase or an ambush if the PCs are ready for him, at your discretion. If the PCs fail again, Delma apprehends Phinick when he is caught sneaking food from the larder in the Feedmill. In any case, once the unfortunate goblin is captured, the PCs can question him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.250,r=0.890,b=0.387), with ID 99634a2a-a2f2-42d0-a6c2-b2e1b24d96f2 -->

Phinick’s Tale  
The PCs intimidate Phinick with their sheer presence, and he is terrified of being blamed for Bort’s death. As a result, he goes to extremes to ingratiate himself with the PCs once he is caught. Although he does not at first mention Bort or the poisoning, if the PCs question him about it and succeed at a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidation check, his facade completely cracks and he begins blubbering, begging the characters for mercy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.401,r=0.891,b=0.554), with ID 4dfdb883-0201-43bc-972f-8f2539e31af9 -->

Phinick explains that shortly after Bort arrived in
town, Hallod, the town bully, cornered the goblin.
Hallod gave him a vial of “spices” and told Phinick
that if he did not put them in Bort’s food, he would
find himself facing the sharp point of one of Hallod’s
many knives. The bully told Phinick that the spices
would only make Bort sick: a little payback for a
bad deal he made with the merchant the last time he
was in town. Not wanting to face a severe beating,
Phinick agreed and slipped the contents of the vial
into Bort’s porridge just before the fight broke out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.557,r=0.890,b=0.722), with ID 6152f967-a9da-4711-b569-075cb7594f99 -->

Shortly thereafter, Phinick fled the bar, only to learn
the next morning that Bort had died from his poisoned
dessert. Terrified, Phinick has been hiding ever since.
He realizes he’s involved, but he begs the characters
for mercy, claiming honestly that he had no idea the
vial was filled with deadly poison. If the players bring
Rolth Garley into this, the sheriff takes the goblin into
custody, locking him up in the cellar of his house until
the circuit judge arrives. After hearing the goblin’s story,
Rolth says that it would go much easier for Phinick if
Hallod were in custody as well. Rolth is afraid of the
massive man, and refuses to take on the bully himself,

Questioning Sir Lawren Krent

Sir Lawren Krent can be found most days sleeping in an abandoned home or a drainage ditch. He smells quite bad by morning, but most days, he dumps a bucket of water or two over himself to preserve what shreds of dignity he has left. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.337,r=0.392,b=0.479), with ID 3cf8c317-5311-4b95-96b7-b28f2c53b27e -->

Sir Lawren is not much help to the PCs’
investigation. He fled the moment the bar brawl
began, and he was very drunk before it had even
started. The former knight is terrified of conflict, and
he is constantly looking over his shoulder as if he is
being followed. See the side quest section on page 59
for more information on what is haunting Sir Lawren. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.479,r=0.453,b=0.587), with ID 6305b70f-4cb8-41a9-b627-f0fcbf4c7135 -->

**QUESTIONING TRIN**  
Trin works four nights a week at the Feedmill while her brother Marny stays home to work the crops, despite the fact that the soil seems to have turned sour. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.598,r=0.452,b=0.664), with ID bb20055e-9006-4fdc-9383-b341716ada73 -->

E. TRIN’S HOUSE                          Low 1
Trin and Marny live on a small turnip farm on the southwest side of town. Although the farm has been struggling this year, the siblings get by on their combined income. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.675,r=0.451,b=0.754), with ID d6315add-0234-454a-8adf-55d1c35ef639 -->

**Creature:** When the PCs arrive at the farm, a PC who succeeds at a DC 10 Perception check notices Marny running clockwise around the farmhouse. The PCs have enough time for a single action, such as drawing a weapon or moving. A moment later, a gigantic boar rounds the farmhouse, chasing the poor man. If the PCs jump into action, they can roll initiative as normal. If they stay back, the pig chases Marny for a minute, catches up to him, wounds him terribly, and flees into the woods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.756,r=0.452,b=0.893), with ID 7bfb7d2d-6c20-4714-949c-ad1dba73a7d9 -->

Trin’s Testimony: Marny thanks any PCs that fought the boar or tended his wounds. If the PCs defeated the angry beast, the farmer gratefully offers to dress and cook the animal for them. Trin recognizes the group from the Feedmill and invites them inside for tea. A bruise is visible on her face. Until they inform her, Trin has no idea that Bort is dead, having left the bar after being hit in the face with a mug. She is shocked by the news of the merchant’s death and gladly helps by relating everything she can remember. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.174,r=0.821,b=0.401), with ID d0bf88ca-ded3-4570-987d-e766c5be9833 -->

Trin spent the evening serving food while Kolnral served drinks. As a result, she spent most of her night going back and forth between the kitchen and tables. She recalls serving all of the food at the PCs’ table, including the turnip porridge right before the fight began. During the struggle, she stood near the table, having just dropped off the desserts, and that’s when she was hit with the mug. Her memory after that is a blur until she got home, when her brother took care of her. She does not recall seeing anyone near the food who should not have been; she confirms that Amora prepared it and Phinick plated it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.404,r=0.818,b=0.602), with ID cede9f09-2a06-42ac-9dc0-c64b2a4e1a6b -->

HALLOD’S HIDEOUT  
Eventually the characters should try to find Hallod at Dead Willow. Located on the north side of town, the building is easy to find—it earned its name from a large dying tree in the front yard—and it’s in very poor condition. When the PCs approach, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.611,r=0.818,b=0.725), with ID 808d063e-1f73-408f-ab61-bc87fefd0e92 -->

A huge, dead willow stands in front of a house that appears to be in serious disrepair. It might have had a second story at one time, but that long ago collapsed into ruin, taking parts of the first floor with it. The windows are all boarded over, and the front door hangs open about a foot, kept from swinging wider by a frayed rope. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.739,r=0.818,b=0.846), with ID c089a130-b2a2-4796-b927-129edaef216d -->

The yard is a complete mess of overgrown weeds. The house itself is constructed from thick wooden posts, slats, and plaster.

Summary : This is a detailed, top-down illustrated map of "Hallod's Hideout" at Dead Willow, showing both above-ground and underground areas, with labeled locations and a grid overlay for navigation or gameplay purposes.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a small area featuring a ruined building, surrounding grounds, and an underground complex.
  • A square grid overlays the entire map, aiding spatial reference (each square likely represents 5 feet, standard for tabletop RPGs).
  • The map is oriented with north at the top.

Keys & Annotations :
  • Title in upper left: "HALLOD'S HIDEOUT DEAD WILLOW".
  • Labeled locations: F1 (dead tree), F2 (building entrance), F3 (north room), F4 (main ruined room), F5 (underground storage/room), F6 (underground main chamber).
  • Visual features: collapsed building, debris, a pool of water, a dead tree, crates/barrels, beds, and a well or pit.
  • Pathways and stairs connect above-ground and underground areas.

Ordering :
  • Above-ground: The main path leads south to a ruined building, with a dead tree (F1) to the west.
  • Underground: Stairs descend from the building to a branching cave system with rooms labeled F5 and F6, connected by corridors.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for use in tabletop roleplaying games, providing clear spatial relationships between above-ground and underground areas.
  • Labeled features and grid facilitate tactical movement and encounter planning.
  • The layout suggests a hideout with defensive and storage areas, and multiple points of interest for exploration. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.014,t=0.010,r=0.669,b=0.968), with ID 4f0be75d-4448-42b5-9ca2-f43f878e12ad -->

from the roof. There is danger here: Hallod has placed
more than one trap to harm uninvited guests. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.127,r=0.450,b=0.156), with ID 6ca48732-26de-4ad7-b78e-31e897293f9c -->

Deep beneath the crumbling house is a small
basement area connected to a series of caves that
eventually emerge under the roots of a giant old
tree in the forest outside town. Hallod discovered
this secret exit years ago when he first explored
the house, and he now uses it as a hideout to serve
Vilree’s interests in Etran’s Folly. He has also used
it to smuggle alchemical reagents out of town, and
to move more sinister cargo in. It is the existence of
these caves that has made Hallod such a valuable
minion to Vilree, and no one but Hallod and a few of
Vilree’s other subordinates know about them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.157,r=0.452,b=0.340), with ID b45a954a-0a7d-426c-89af-5895c20a5c21 -->

Hallod is here, laying low until the events
surrounding Bort’s death blow over. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.342,r=0.451,b=0.372), with ID 2e6c3342-b127-4535-8f29-b06ff178225f -->

F1. The Yard  
The yard around the house is choked with weeds and debris from the collapsed house. The area around the willow tree is all but impassible, as the dead branches and leaves have made a large heap around its trunk. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check reveals that someone frequents the property; their trail leads up to the front door, circles the house, and leads down to the stream. A critical success on this check uncovers that the trail never actually goes in through the poorly latched front door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.384,r=0.452,b=0.556), with ID ac454053-ba85-4335-ba9e-cf9185416a87 -->

F2. FRONT DOOR  
The front door to the house no longer sits properly in its frame and is kept from swinging wide open by a simple rope attached to the inside latch. Even with this, it still hangs open about a foot. All of this is a ruse, as this entrance is trapped. (Hallod never goes in using the front door, instead using a window in the back.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.568,r=0.451,b=0.692), with ID 795bce77-33ce-4ea7-8bc6-a6207e329249 -->

Hazard: The taut rope holding the door disappears into a pile of debris clogging the foyer beyond. Hidden inside the heaps of straw, broken wood, and chunks of plaster is an old heavy crossbow that Hallod has rigged to fire a spear through the doorway if the rope is cut or otherwise released from the door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.695,r=0.451,b=0.785), with ID 35417665-3b40-40b3-89a9-a58114edbd76 -->

Beyond the door, the foyer empties into a clearly
abandoned living space. The hearth is choked with
branches and debris from above, the furniture is
smashed and soiled, and a thick layer of dirt and
grime covers every surface. It is obvious that no
one has used this room in years. The only other exit
leads to a room thoroughly filled with debris from
the collapsed roof above. Digging through the debris
would take several hours at least and would likely
cause a further collapse of the ruined second story
above. If the PCs do find a way through, they enter
area F4 without needing to use the hidden window
entrance (F3). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.265,r=0.819,b=0.464), with ID 0ff49099-2ec0-4d5e-8db4-a65a5e6fa246 -->

F3. HIDDEN WINDOW ENTRANCE  
The footpath that leads around the house passes under a boarded-over window at the back of the house, then down to the stream where Hallod gets water. The boarded-over window is fake; Hallod nailed the boards onto a hinged shutter, allowing it to be opened with ease. This ruse is not simple to detect, but careful inspection and a successful DC 16 Perception check uncovers it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.477,r=0.818,b=0.616), with ID 4fe9ee6a-0b5c-4269-988e-1db6affaa608 -->

The shutter is latched from the inside, and there  
does not appear to be a keyhole of any sort, but due  
to its roughly constructed nature, the shutter can  
be opened with a successful DC 16 Thievery check  
(trained) or Forced Open with a successful DC 18  
Athletics check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.618,r=0.818,b=0.708), with ID dcb36d4e-7161-4fc4-a8f9-0a5107305bcc -->

F4. CRAWLWAY AND HATCH  
The shuttered entrance leads to a room filled with debris from the collapsed roof. There’s just enough room for two Medium creatures to stand in this space, and a cursory inspection from this spot uncovers a crawlway under the debris. Unlike everything else, this crawlway is mostly free from grime and dust. Characters can move through the crawlway only in single file. Medium creatures can crawl 5 feet per action; Small and smaller creatures can move at normal speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.722,r=0.818,b=0.877), with ID 8614f34f-d422-452d-b88c-d66e3d732366 -->

Hazard: After 15 feet, the crawlway takes a left turn. There is a trap located in the floor at this spot. Anyone putting pressure on the floor where the crawlway turns sets off the trap: debris rains down <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.879,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 0c6770a8-c406-4f5a-9a2d-1eb938271ab0 -->

FALLING DEBRIS                        HAZARD 1

MECHANICAL      TRAP

Stealth DC 17 (trained)
Description A pressure-sensitive floorboard connects to a beam holding up debris in the crawlway’s ceiling.

AC 16; Fort +8, Ref +2
Hardness 5; HP 20 (BT 10); Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Falling Debris Trigger Pressure is placed on the floorboard. Effect The ceiling in the crawlway collapses in the square where the passage turns, and also in the two adjacent squares. Anyone in these three squares takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage. For the creature in the center square, where the trap is triggered, this is a basic save. Creatures in the two adjacent squares take no damage on a success or critical success as they avoid the falling debris entirely, but take full damage on a failed save, and take double damage on a critical failure. Creatures that take damage from the debris are immobilized, trapped under the crushing weight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.167,r=0.525,b=0.540), with ID 307b946e-95d2-408b-9a63-e96a880237d3 -->

Clearing out a square of debris requires a successful DC 17 Athletics skill check, with the following effects.
  Critical Success The square is cleared in 1 minute.
  Success The square is cleared in 5 minutes.
  Failure The square is cleared in 10 minutes.
  Critical Failure The ceiling above the square collapses further, dealing an additional 2d6 to the character digging out the square and any character trapped in that square. This takes 1 minute and no progress is made. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.190,t=0.541,r=0.526,b=0.695), with ID bbf0ed8f-f841-4da8-bf2a-73810146d57f -->

Beyond the turn, the crawlway continues for
another 10 feet before opening up into a small
chamber that appears to have once been a closet.
The door leaving the space is barred by debris on the
other side and cannot be opened, but there is a hatch
built into the floor. It is very old, but free from debris
and dust. The hatch is not locked, but the hinge is
terribly rusted. Opening it without making any noise
requires a successful DC 18 Thievery check, although
applying oil to the hinge reduces this to DC 12. If the
PCs make noise lifting the hatch, Hallod has even
more time to prepare for the PCs arrival, as noted
in F5, below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.708,r=0.525,b=0.906), with ID bf1c76fd-9571-48fc-beeb-a215cbbed679 -->

Under the hatch is a stone-lined chute that descends
almost 30 feet. Handholds have been carved into the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.908,r=0.525,b=0.940), with ID b51d0491-f57e-43fa-b600-439eb18a8e58 -->

stone wall, but they are uneven and treacherous.
There is no light in the chute. Unless the PCs have
a way to bring light with them, climbing down the
chute requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check.
With light, the going is slow, but no check is required.
The chute ends in area F5, down in the basement.
  XP Award: For dealing with both of Hallod’s
hazards, award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.129,r=0.892,b=0.249), with ID 0d909b4e-b37c-4858-b10d-e99dec11577d -->

F5. BASEMENT KENNEL                MODERATE 1
The chute deposits the PCs into a short hallway that leads to a wooden door. The door is not locked, and it leads into the deep basement of the house above. When the PCs open the door, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.261,r=0.891,b=0.356), with ID f4ddc30c-d4fb-415c-aee8-d69d5cfe5170 -->

The old wooden door swings open on rusted hinges, revealing a room lit by a single, flickering torch. Through the gloom you see piles of small crates and more than a few barrels stacked up haphazardly on the south side of the room. Opposite you is a stout wooden door with iron bands, while the north side of the room is bare save for an iron gate set into the middle of the wall. The stench of smoke and damp dog hangs heavy in the air. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.370,r=0.890,b=0.495), with ID e39efaa4-e686-4455-a4a0-a5df5824e59b -->

If the PCs made a great deal of noise in opening the hatch, Hallod had plenty of time to set up an additional danger for them by spilling a few pints of alchemical grease on the area in front of the door.

Anyone attempting to move through these spaces by means other than a Step must attempt a DC 13 Acrobatics check or Reflex saving throw or fall prone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.510,r=0.890,b=0.646), with ID af089371-8a96-4f01-b9eb-58a6fccea39a -->

The door leading out of this room into area **F6** is locked, but it can be opened with two successful DC 15 Thievery skill checks. It can also be Forced Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or by dealing 40 points of damage to the door (Hardness 10). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.648,r=0.890,b=0.739), with ID 9efb60c5-4066-4bd5-9598-c357c472b38d -->

**Creatures:** Even if the PCs did not make noise while opening the hatch, they cannot possibly make it down the chute without alerting Hallod, who then stations himself beyond the wooden door to area **F6.** Watching through a slit in the door, he begins turning a wheel that raises the iron gate as soon as the PCs enter the room. This releases four angry and starving guard dogs into the room. Their barks and growls flood the room the moment the grate begins to move. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.741,r=0.890,b=0.892), with ID 3bb5dd52-39b3-4c4b-bfb7-4fa884ae9c62 -->

Rewards: Anyone searching through the barrels and crates finds them to be empty save for packing straw and scraps of cloth, but a successful DC 16 Perception check while digging through them uncovers 2 vials of lesser alchemist’s fire, forgotten underneath a pile of straw. A critical success at this check also reveals a small glass bottle filled with a murky, foul-smelling brown liquid. Identifying this liquid requires a DC 19 Crafting skill check. Success reveals that it is a foul alchemical reagent called corpse blood, used in a variety of alchemical items mostly related to disease, poison, or their antidotes. The box containing this bottle clearly once had 7 other bottles in it, all of which appear to be missing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.202,r=0.454,b=0.419), with ID 63dbae7a-a83a-437f-a4e1-48e092c8bc90 -->

F6. HALLOD’S HOME  
This chamber is entered via a short hallway remarkable only for a large steel wheel on the wall; this opens the iron gate in area F5, behind which Hallod keeps his dogs. A viewing slit in the door to area F5 allows one to see into that room. Hallod flees immediately after releasing his guard dogs. He moves quickly through this area, exiting into the caves beyond where there are additional defenses and, more importantly, his stash of juggernaut mutagen. This leaves his living quarters unattended, but searching for clues here will take time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.430,r=0.453,b=0.616), with ID c1a7b359-0161-4b1a-a3f1-2cc14c0843e4 -->

The home is divided into three areas: the larder, the lavatory, and the living space. The larder is a simple storeroom filled with scraps of old meat, a third of a wheel of cheese, a sack of turnips, and a barrel of weak ale. There is also a crate of empty wine bottles in one corner. They are all of a good Chelish vintage and were probably quite valuable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.617,r=0.452,b=0.724), with ID d0d5f15a-de7e-4e59-9dff-4e2245bf93b5 -->

The lavatory sits just off the main living space, and it is little more than an open pit. This is also where Hallod disposes of his garbage, and there are scraps of moldy food and bits of junk in the corners of the room. Anyone who investigates can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to notice that there are a number of small, identical bottles scattered among the trash. Examining the bottles reveals they all have a silvery residue in the bottom that smells strongly of iron and something else terribly acrid. A successful DC 15 Crafting check reveals this to be remnants of a juggernaut mutagen. A critical success on this check uncovers that there is also something sweet-smelling in the mix. (This is an addictive oil that Vilree started <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.725,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID 081446dd-38bd-4adb-a93a-fe3292c38d4e -->

The living area is a mess, with a cot in one
corner and a crude firepit in the other. A simple
chimney leads up from this room before connect-
ing to another in the house above. Bits of trash and a
few pieces of gear can be found with a simple search,
including a whetstone, a dagger, 15 feet of rope, a
hammer, 2 candles, and a coin purse with 2 gp, 8 sp,
and 14 cp. This area connects to the larder, to the
lavatory, to the short hallway leading back to the
kennel, and to an open passageway that leads off
into darkness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.190,r=0.818,b=0.355), with ID 5fcb57ea-7c26-4777-98c5-36c81e53809c -->

**Hazard:** The real prize to be found here is a strongbox located underneath the cot. Although it is not hard to find, it is made from stout wood, banded in iron, closed with a simple lock, and trapped. The chest can be opened with three successful DC 20 Thievery skill checks, or with the key that Hallod has in his pocket. In either case, attempting to open the box triggers the trap if it is not disarmed first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.358,r=0.818,b=0.479), with ID 20b32471-b532-48f7-8c61-8cd05770f287 -->

**Rewards:** Inside the chest is a batch of 14 receipts that match the logs from Bort’s ledgers (see Bort’s Books on page 10), as well as a scrap of parchment that lists each transaction along with a value slightly higher than that listed on the corresponding receipt from Bort. The chest contains some of the gold that Hallod has skimmed from these transactions over the years (the reason for the difference in values). Although Hallod has spent much of the difference, the chest still contains 21 gp and 37 sp.

the back of the transaction list is a crude map. It
depicts a cave helpfully labeled “HIDEOUT,” next to
a shape that might be a pond; from there, a winding
path passes through a strange V-shaped chamber
before ending at what appears to be a clearing with
a tree stump labeled “DROP POINT.” This is a map
to the place where Hallod drops off the supplies he
acquires, and where he received payments and drugs
from Vilree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.264), with ID 4d246782-61f7-4d6e-9b63-06495e34bb41 -->

The passageway leading from this chamber begins
as worked stone, but as it goes further and further, it
becomes more of a natural cavern passage, worked
only here and there to make it more passable. It
connects to area F7. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.265,r=0.525,b=0.341), with ID 7870b07b-7d1b-4edf-981e-09b5c5b082fe -->

Summary : This is a detailed color illustration of a fantastical serpent, labeled "Giant Lightning Serpent," with blue-green scales and an electrified, metallic tail tip, depicted in a dynamic, aggressive pose with its mouth open and lightning arcing from its fangs and tail.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a large, blue-green serpent with prominent scales, a wide-open mouth, and visible fangs.
  • The serpent's tail ends in a metallic, coil-like structure emitting blue lightning.
  • The creature is shown in a dynamic, coiled posture, with its head raised and mouth agape, suggesting aggression or attack.
  • The color palette is dominated by shades of blue, teal, and green, with bright electric blue highlights for the lightning effects.
  • The background is white, isolating the serpent and emphasizing its features.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference, but the label "Giant Lightning Serpent" implies large scale.
  • The lightning effect is rendered with glowing blue lines and a soft aura, both at the mouth and tail.
  • The metallic tail tip is segmented and spiraled, resembling a Tesla coil or similar electrical apparatus.
  • The serpent's mouth shows detailed anatomy, including fangs, tongue, and inner mouth coloration.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The serpent's head and upper body dominate the foreground, with the tail receding into the background but curving back into view.
  • The lightning at the tail tip is positioned in the upper right, drawing attention to the unique feature.
  • The label "Giant Lightning Serpent" appears in the lower left corner, partially overlaid on the image.

Analysis :
  • The illustration emphasizes the creature's electrical abilities and aggressive nature through the use of dynamic posture, open mouth, and vivid lightning effects.
  • The metallic, electrified tail is a focal point, distinguishing this serpent from natural species and reinforcing its fantastical, possibly magical, attributes.
  • The isolated white background and strong color contrast make the serpent the clear center of attention, suitable for use in a bestiary or fantasy game manual. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.123,t=0.386,r=0.573,b=0.893), with ID e46c3a68-c4b8-42a0-8472-5d02fbfd10f8 -->

F7. Snake Pool

Low 1
Beyond Hallod’s living quarters is a system of natural caves. Although the path is far from level, it has been worked to allow for easy travel; stalagmites have been cleared away in some spots and small wooden footbridges have been stretched over pools of stagnant water no more than 5 feet deep. After about 10 minutes of travel, the PCs arrive at a small cave with a larger, more ominous pool of water in the middle. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter this area. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.123,r=0.891,b=0.296), with ID cf8df1cf-2b26-4e8d-8423-07785d1a995f -->

The passageway opens up into a large natural chamber, the center of which is occupied by a pool of brackish water. Stalactites and stalagmites occupy much of the room, but a path between them leads around the pool and to another corridor on the opposite side of the cave. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.308,r=0.890,b=0.389), with ID 582ccb62-4d12-4201-8e20-00c585c9c379 -->

**Creature:** The moment the PCs enter the room, a strange blue glow emanates up from the pool, sending a cascade of shimmering light to the ceiling above. Seconds later, the head of a giant blue snake rises from the pool with sparks of electricity dancing between its fangs, while a metal, rattle-tipped tail pokes out of the water behind it, audibly building up a charge with every flick of the rattle.

The giant lightning serpent was a gift from Vilree to Hallod to protect his lair. It is loyal to the brute, but it gives no quarter to the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.401,r=0.891,b=0.568), with ID bca21efc-cc60-4d73-9af8-9e3c278d5b0f -->

Reward: At the bottom of the shallow pool is the body of an explorer who died here many years ago. Nothing more than bones now, the body has slowly been consumed by limestone that has calcified around its skeleton. A successful DC 15 Perception check spots the body. Anyone who investigates finds the pommel of a weapon sticking out of the stone. Breaking it out will take a hammer and at least 20 minutes of work, but doing so recovers a low-grade silver rapier. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.172,r=0.453,b=0.327), with ID 48238ffe-b266-481c-8b62-5cc1702a6988 -->

F8. HALLOD’S AMBUSH        SEVERE 1
The tunnel beyond the snake’s lair twists and turns for a great distance; it takes the PCs 10 minutes to traverse it before they can detect a faint natural light up ahead, and the air becomes notably cleaner, smelling vaguely of grass. After another 5 minutes of travel, the tunnel opens up into a cave mouth. Read or paraphrase the following to the players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.337,r=0.452,b=0.465), with ID 7408c3c8-f08e-4cf2-9764-d54da044a017 -->

The tunnel you have been traversing opens into a cave, and you can see a forest beyond the cave’s mouth. The roots of a large tree block the middle of this entrance, as if the tree had grown into a hillside that has since eroded away. Beyond the tree is a large pond; a path around the water begins to one side beneath a curtain of moss hanging from the tree. The cave itself is piled high with two rows of neatly stacked crates and boxes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.478,r=0.451,b=0.604), with ID ec2e5a65-d107-4bc2-a994-1d965be69aee -->

This cave is where Hallod stored the reagents before delivering them to Vilree at the prearranged drop spot. The thug waits here for the players to arrive, and he has a few traps prepared for them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.617,r=0.451,b=0.677), with ID 7c4beca8-5efa-4256-b15c-acfcb425bd00 -->

**Creature:** Hallod is a rough-looking man. He is bald and has a prominent scar running down his face from an axe wound he took years ago. He is wearing filthy leather armor and wields a nasty kukri with deadly efficiency. When the PCs enter the room, he hops up on a berm formed by the tree roots, aims his crossbow at them, and taunts them by saying, “I wondered when Bort’s lackeys would arrive. Let’s do this!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.679,r=0.451,b=0.800), with ID 234b0e5b-91f1-4578-be9c-4bdf45f285ca -->

Years ago, Hallod began making use of mutagens
supplied to him by Vilree, but unbeknownst to him,
they were laced with a drug that made them addictive.
Today, Hallod is totally hooked on mutagen and will
do whatever the alchemist demands so long as he can
get his fix. At the start of the fight, he drinks his lesser
juggernaut mutagen, then fires his crossbow and
waits for the PCs to come to him. This also forces
them to deal with his traps. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.802,r=0.451,b=0.939), with ID 14746aca-5e16-4058-b7cf-09e400fec81b -->

Hallod,
The final shipment of corpse blood is due in just over a week, and it is the last thing I need from that greedy bastard, Bort.

Attack of Opportunity ↻
Dirty Trick ◇ Trigger Hallod scores a critical hit with a melee attack. Effect Hallod can attempt an Athletics check to Shove or Trip the target of his attack. This uses the same multiple attack penalty as the attack, but it does not count as an additional attack for that penalty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.510,r=0.522,b=0.617), with ID a284eb21-dddd-4769-8653-050edef29325 -->

One-Two Move  ![inline micro-figure: double chevron icon] Hallod makes two Strikes, one with each hand; he usually attacks first with his kukri. If this first attack hits, the target is flat-footed to the second attack (which for Hallod is usually a fist Strike). The multiple attack penalty applies to these attacks as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.617,r=0.521,b=0.708), with ID 41507424-c88e-4162-814a-94dc1ebf1ef3 -->

**Hazards:** Hallod has set up a pair of spear launcher traps in this room, with rather obvious trip lines stretching from wall to wall between the rows of barrels and crates (these ropes are marked on the map with dotted lines). Due to this obvious nature, anyone about to enter a space occupied by a trip line can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to notice the trigger. Those that fail trigger the trap. Once seen, the ropes are obviously avoided, but characters cannot end their move in a space occupied by a rope without setting off the trap. Even if the PCs do not trigger the traps, Hallod <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.754,r=0.524,b=0.939), with ID 8430aedb-d3cb-437e-8bdc-f3d5ed34751f -->

In addition, if a character is pushed into a crate or box, the container collapses into a pile of broken wood and debris.

**Rewards:** Hallod has the key that opens the strongbox in area **F6**, and the crates here are not all empty.

**Last Missive:** Folded up in Hallod’s pocket is a note written on a scrap of parchment. It is in Vilree’s handwriting, which is distinctly unlike any of the other writing the PCs have encountered in the adventure to this point. The style is plain and very severe, as if self-taught.

**The Drop Point**  
Located about 3 miles outside Etran’s Folly, the drop point on Hallod’s map is little more than a large hollow tree stump in a small clearing. Inside are a few empty crates, but nothing of value. Knowing this location, however, it vital to learning the location of Vilree’s true lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.829,r=0.891,b=0.938), with ID 7abebc99-a5e7-468a-8c6f-5dcb8757733c -->

UNSOLVED MURDER  
In tracking down Hallod and exploring his hideout, the players have made significant progress in determining who caused the untimely demise of Bort the dwarf merchant. Unfortunately, the villain who ordered the murder is still at large. Even worse, there’s no way to learn where this mysterious “V” might be found. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.120,r=0.457,b=0.249), with ID 605c3339-7797-4022-bdd4-8093f061367a -->

Taking this information to Rolth only adds to the
inept sheriff’s worry. Worse than a simple murder,
the PC’s investigation has uncovered a nefarious plot
involving secret agents and clandestine deliveries,
with roots stretching back many years. These events
do clear the name of the PCs and of the members
of the caravan, but the sheriff pleads with the PCs
to help him uncover the true culprit. There are two
other factors at play here: Tamli’s desire for closure,
and the appearance of a mysterious ranger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.250,r=0.456,b=0.402), with ID 84ff50bb-a6d6-4732-80ca-29de9c0b6cbf -->

Tamli is keen to hear what happened in the caves underneath Hallod’s home. She listens with rapt attention, the knuckles on her clenched hands white with tension, as the story unfolds. Although she is relieved that the man directly responsible for Bort’s death has been caught, she grows quiet at the revelation that there was someone else involved. After a moment of silence, she asks how the PCs plan to find the mastermind behind all this, expecting the group to continue the search. Should they balk, a pained look crosses her face, and she retrieves her coin purse to offer them 43 gp in assorted coins to continue the investigation. It is her entire savings, but finding the killer means that much to her and the others. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.403,r=0.456,b=0.617), with ID c3810e85-2d2a-463f-a6e6-6319d8675164 -->

Around this time (or perhaps just before the heroes
go to Hallod’s home), a mysterious ranger comes
to town dragging a sledge and burdened by the
carcasses of several wolves. The body of the caustic
wolf from the beginning of this adventure is among
the corpses (if the PCs did not bury it). The ranger is
looking for whoever is responsible (see the Ranger’s
Request on page 24 for more information). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.617,r=0.456,b=0.742), with ID 513c2656-5c7e-4a9e-971b-e5ccd7c4e30d -->

## Hallod Lives?
It is possible that the PCs took Hallod alive, subduing him rather than killing him. If so, Sheriff Rolth has the thug bound to a post in a locked barn just outside town. Hallod is under constant watch, being held until the circuit judge arrives to mete out justice. The PCs are free to question him, but he refuses to say much of anything until the withdrawal from his mutagen addiction begins to take hold, which takes 3 or 4 days. At that point, Hallod will say just about anything to get another dose. Alternatively, the PCs might be able to coerce information out of Hallod or <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.750,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID 476b07d2-f7b9-45a8-aa0e-2a182aebfe46 -->

THE SECRET OF VILREE  
Vilree’s identity and history are not meant  
to be a great secret, but the PCs should have to  
invest some effort in uncovering her backstory.  
There are many people around town who are  
old enough to remember the plague and the dark  
years that followed it, most notably Edra Wythe,  
Delma and Targen Fulst, and Flonk, who picked  
up the tale shortly after he arrived (although  
his details might be suspect). Most have some  
recollection of the events concerning Silwyth the  
alchemist and her feud with Father Bolgrist, the  
town priest; if pressed, they remember that Silwyth  
had a daughter named Vilree who survived the  
plague but disappeared a few years after. The most  
likely source of this tale is Targen Fulst, who tells  
part of it when the PCs take him on a tour of the  
town (page 12). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.113,r=0.818,b=0.415), with ID 724ffbae-df2a-416a-8917-1599c4cb4101 -->

talk him into revealing a few details by using skills
(mostly likely Diplomacy and Intimidation), subject
to your discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.433,r=0.820,b=0.479), with ID f5ca04ae-db4c-4808-b9bd-85da2e852146 -->

In any case, Hallod is not too bright and actually
knows very little about his employer’s plans. He
knows her name is Vilree, and that she once lived
in Etran’s Folly, but he does not know when or
why she left. He met her about six years ago, when
he chanced upon her in the woods. He found her
roasting beetles from nearby trees and collecting
the ashes, and she invited him to share her fire
and her wine. He was enchanted by her strange
countenance—she has big eyes and pointed ears,
but not so pointed as an elf’s. They met several
times over the next few months, and while Hallod
was smitten, Vilree never returned the affection.
Hoping to prove himself, Hallod began to do small
tasks for her, and she began to use him to smuggle
goods back and forth from Etran’s Folly via the
cave network underneath his home. He never
learned where she lived, and as time went on, they
met in person less and less. Vilree is busy, he says;
she has important work to do (not that Hallod
has any idea what that is). He has not seen her in
person for over a year now, and they communicate
only by notes left at their prearranged drop point.
He gets her whatever she asks for; in return, she
pays him and makes sure he has an ample supply
of his additive mutagen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.480,r=0.820,b=0.877), with ID 39646291-4759-4c9f-a217-f100873e3985 -->

Hallod has no further role to play in this adventure.
If left in Rolth’s custody, he is taken away by the circuit judge in a month’s time to serve in a labor mine for the rest of his life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.878,r=0.822,b=0.940), with ID 18401a7f-3d9b-4d53-9299-ce68236838c7 -->

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subjects are three humanoid figures: one in light armor wielding a sword, one in the foreground with a bow, and one large, muscular figure with greenish skin and tribal attire.
  • The setting is a nighttime forest, with a campfire at the center casting dramatic, warm light and shadows on the characters.
  • The composition is dynamic, with the characters arranged in a triangular formation around the fire, suggesting a moment of intense combat or confrontation.
  • The color palette is dominated by dark blues and greens in the background, contrasted by the bright orange and yellow glow of the fire.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is bordered by a stylized wooden fence and green vines, with mushrooms in the upper left corner.
  • The title "PART 2: THE RANGER'S REQUEST" is prominently displayed at the bottom in green text on a parchment-like banner.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The campfire is centrally located, serving as the focal point and light source.
  • The armored figure is on the left, the archer is in the foreground with their back to the viewer, and the large green-skinned figure is on the right, lunging forward.

  • The use of lighting and composition draws attention to the central conflict and highlights the fantasy adventure theme.
  • The decorative border and title suggest this is an introductory or chapter image for a role-playing game or fantasy story segment. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.003,r=0.997,b=0.559), with ID 23efb471-dc6d-4ee8-87ba-a58b38d638e7 -->

This part of the adventure can occur anytime
after the PCs arrive in town, but preferably
after a few days have passed—perhaps during
the investigation into Bort’s death. It begins when
Noala Kessir, an elven ranger, comes to Etran’s Folly
looking for the people who killed several wolves just
outside of town. She had been tracking the beasts,
including their mutated leader, and is relieved to see
them put down. She hopes to find those responsible,
as they might be hardy enough to help her root
out the cause of these corrupted animals. She asks
around town until she is directed to the PCs. Once
this occurs, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.570,r=0.527,b=0.772), with ID a83c3abe-16cf-4753-9838-a0d90e227b83 -->

A woman shrouded in a heavy brown cloak trimmed with leaves marches up to you, pulling a simple wooden sledge behind her. As she approaches, she brings the sledge to one side and uncovers her cargo, a pile of wolf carcasses. She turns to you, and despite having her cloak’s hood pulled low, you can make out weathered lips and a slender chin. In a pointed tone, she asks, “Is this your work?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.783,r=0.525,b=0.896), with ID e88f27f5-7a35-40f9-9f85-48293d68feb8 -->

Noala has been serving these woods for many years,
having retired here after fighting in the Goblinblood wars. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.907,r=0.526,b=0.942), with ID 57057cb8-586c-4e4f-bb2a-13ecbe3a29c3 -->

It was a conflict that left her broken, but not defeated.
Hoping to find purpose after all the violence, she found
these people in need and decided to stay. No one in
town has any particular reason to trust her, but she
does not need their trust to keep the folk and the wilds
from abusing one another. The only person who has
any regular dealings with Noala is Delma, who sells her
supplies and reassures her that the community values
her work. Delma has also made it clear that she hopes to
make the ranger’s role one that is officially supported by
the town, once her father finally retires. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.572,r=0.892,b=0.739), with ID 554c67d2-e4f4-4e92-9672-90b446829483 -->

Noala is suspicious of others, but the aging ranger
recognizes that things have slowly been getting worse
and, as she’s nursing an arm injury, the crisis is beyond
her ability to solve alone. She hopes that the PCs will
help her get to the bottom of the blight that has taken
hold of the wilderness around Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.741,r=0.892,b=0.832), with ID f1ed11d2-3288-4c43-976f-d72d760190e0 -->

# THE BLIGHT
For the past several years, there has been an ever-growing blight in the region. What started a few years ago with a single group of sickly trees has become a series of seemingly unconnected pockets of dead and dying plants. Worse still, some of the animals <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.842,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID 917ba77f-f741-4282-88fa-b9ad71db4aa4 -->

living near these areas have strange mutations and
have turned hostile to travelers and locals alike.
There is no obvious cause. The only common
element is that in each afflicted area,
the blight seems to start in a
grove of very large, old trees.
What Noala does not realize is
that below the surface, the deep
taproots of these older trees
are absorbing groundwater
polluted by alchemical runoff
and discarded reagents from
Vilree’s secret lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.125,r=0.545,b=0.332), with ID 28ed70be-917e-4045-a48b-8ad49a3ed9d4 -->

corpses to the flame. She avoids the use of  
her right hand, which is entirely covered in an  
oddly shaped leather gauntlet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.124,r=0.760,b=0.173), with ID 37c55f4e-b7aa-4787-a091-36bf68f2cbe1 -->

“These wolves aren’t the first, and I am
afraid they won’t be the last. Worse still,”
she grunts, as she begins to drag
the body of the caustic wolf to the
fire, “the forest itself is turning sour.
Plants and trees are withering, bearing
bitter fruit that sickens and kills those
who eat it. If you’ve been out to the old
orchard, you’ve seen it. The blight is growing,
and I need your help to stop it.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.520,t=0.172,r=0.821,b=0.329), with ID 87a26b19-f3f0-47e0-bda6-115c70f9419b -->

Noala’s proposition is simple. She  
explains what she knows about the  
blight and asks the PCs to accompany  
her to these dying parts of the woods  
and get to the bottom of it. While the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.553,t=0.337,r=0.819,b=0.419), with ID cc9caa97-617b-43d4-93d3-d79cab966984 -->

and they always seem to
have a mundane explanation
for what’s happening: it’s just
a bad summer, or maybe a pig died
in the stream a few months back. Noala
knows it is something more, and while she
has done all she can to keep the people safe and put
down any blighted creatures, she simply cannot solve
this problem on her own. Several months ago, after
cataloging the locations of the largest blights, she went
to Sheriff Rolth with Delma’s blessing, hoping that he
might request aid from the local baron. Unfortunately,
the lazy sheriff has no time for “tree problems,” and he
pointedly refused to help her or even inform anyone
else of the danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.369,r=0.455,b=0.601), with ID 38b4d3c9-4691-48a0-a7a4-a1cf6955312d -->

Now things are worse than ever, and some of the
blights are showing signs that the plants themselves
are changing, becoming something else. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.601,r=0.454,b=0.651), with ID cb345bc3-a23a-4f34-8581-303adb8bdd05 -->

A SIMPLE TASK  
Noala fears that if she does not get to the bottom of this problem soon, it may spread to the farms and fields, affecting the town and even spreading further than this small community. In this desperate hour, she sees the PCs as her best chance at success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.656,r=0.454,b=0.755), with ID 5c8e0508-9737-44cc-ac84-f6b3a4971f86 -->

After introducing herself, she asks if they might accompany her out into the woods where she can burn the wolves’ bodies and talk in private. If the PCs would rather discuss things in town, the disposal of the wolf corpses can wait. Assuming they find a quiet place to talk, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.755,r=0.455,b=0.850), with ID 55d15ddb-7e00-41a1-a7a0-9624f7f9e442 -->

The mysterious woman leads you to a clearing in the woods, not far from the town itself, where a small fire is already burning in a carefully kept fire pit. She tosses back her hood to reveal long, elven ears and deep, emerald eyes.

Noala’s proposition is simple. She
explains what she knows about the
blight and asks the PCs to accompany
her to these dying parts of the woods
and get to the bottom of it. While the
characters might not want to take on <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.337,r=0.820,b=0.435), with ID c6bab7f8-ef02-4441-8da0-3527d12ca208 -->

characters might not want to take on  
this mission merely out of generosity,  
Noala offers to train them in wilderness  
survival skills and ranged combat techniques if they  
agree to help her (see Noala’s Training in the Rules  
and Rewards section on page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.421,r=0.818,b=0.512), with ID db6f3297-f0d2-4815-99c5-59d6c2c7b714 -->

Any offer to help her burn the corpses is gladly accepted, but Noala refuses to talk about her hand, saying only that it is an old wound. If pressed, she offers up that maybe it is a tale worth telling, but only after the blight is dealt with. See Noala’s entry in the NPCs Around Town appendix on page 53 for more information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.510,r=0.819,b=0.617), with ID 5e292a33-a18d-4cbf-a4a0-0d2edcef7de1 -->

If the PCs have already defeated Hallod, they might
suspect that these blights and the mysterious “V” are
in some way related. Noala knows nothing of Vilree,
but the fact that there is someone working with vile
reagents strikes her as unlikely to be a coincidence.
She suggests that finding the cause of the blight might
help track down the person behind Bort’s death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.617,r=0.821,b=0.724), with ID b917446f-a51e-4d92-9505-9358485ec487 -->

If the PCs agree, Noala offers to take them to a
nearby blight in the morning, perhaps moving on to a
larger one deeper in the forest if necessary. She tells the
PCs to pack for a lengthy journey, as the largest blight
is located deep in the woods and is hard to reach on
foot. If the PCs have not yet caught Hallod, they may
have to do so before being able to leave town without
provoking Rolth’s ire. Noala is willing to wait for the
PCs, but she stresses the urgency of the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.724,r=0.822,b=0.863), with ID daac3e91-45cd-4139-a5bf-d75638c81d6b -->

# THE BLIGHTED DEN
When the PCs are ready to go exploring with Noala,
she arranges to meet them just outside of town at the
site of the wolf ambush. Noala arrives at first light. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.872,r=0.821,b=0.941), with ID 971d8387-c06d-42ea-919a-7f2544f7a0c6 -->

Summary : This is a color map for a fantasy roleplaying game encounter area called "The Blighted Den," showing a forest clearing, a cave, and labeled encounter zones with a grid overlay for tactical movement.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • Depicts a forested area with a clearing and a cave, labeled "THE BLIGHTED DEN" in the northwest.
  • Overlaid with a square grid; each square represents 5 feet.
  • North arrow with cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) is present in the southwest.
  • No latitude/longitude or real-world coordinates; fantasy setting.

Keys & Annotations :
  • Two labeled encounter zones: "G1" (central clearing) and "G2" (inside the cave).
  • "G2" contains a pool of water and a creature illustration.
  • "G1" contains three tree stumps or logs and is surrounded by forest.
  • Pathways and fallen logs are visible; cave entrance is marked by tree roots and stairs.
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" is noted in the southeast corner.

Ordering :
  • The main path enters from the east, leading to the central clearing (G1), then westward up stairs and tree roots into the cave (G2).
  • The cave is in the northwest, the clearing is central, and the path enters from the east.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical tabletop play, with clear movement and encounter zones.
  • The layout channels movement from the forest path into the clearing, then up into the cave, suggesting a progression of encounters.
  • The grid and scale support precise positioning for miniatures or tokens.
  • The dense forest restricts movement to the paths and open areas, focusing action in the labeled zones. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.023,t=0.005,r=0.995,b=0.549), with ID b884b395-56e7-46b5-b271-a372236108ae -->

Once all have gathered, she explains her general plan. She will lead the PCs to the nearby blight, which the PCs will enter and explore. Noala will roam around the site, setting up snares on common trails and ensuring that any stray creatures flushed out of the area are contained. The PCs might question this plan, but Noala persists, claiming that her wilderness skills allow her to excel at hunting, not close combat. Once the area is cleared, she hopes to investigate it fully to see if there is anything to be learned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.570,r=0.525,b=0.724), with ID f9fbd705-b279-43f6-8d61-c439f5417a7f -->

Traveling to the first blight takes about 3 hours on foot. Mounts do nothing to hasten this pace, as the trail is little more than a winding game path. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.724,r=0.524,b=0.771), with ID ba0df1aa-7f30-414f-9ae0-56a43e877d6c -->

G1. ROTTEN COPSE                        SEVERE 2
The first sign that the PCs are approaching the blight is that the plants in the area are a sickly shade of green with spots of brown. Soon, the forest smells of sweet rot, and the trees look entirely unhealthy, their bark peeling off in sticky black strips. Once they reach this point, read or paraphrase the following to the players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.782,r=0.524,b=0.895), with ID d862e683-1770-4cfc-9d03-e3a1703ad752 -->

The presence of rot increases with every step you take, and Noala slows to a stop, turns to look at you, saying, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.907,r=0.523,b=0.941), with ID 1e00e5a6-914a-4338-ad01-ce605d596f4e -->

“This is where those wolves came from, I am sure of it. Somewhere ahead is their den, but I will leave that for you to explore. If you need my help, you will find me out here. I am going to set up snares and make sure nothing gets out of this rotten copse.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.570,r=0.892,b=0.650), with ID fcd3955e-b174-41d6-8e67-651a46df394c -->

From here, the players need only follow the trail into the heart of this small blight. As they travel, the ground softens and squelches underfoot due to the sticky runoff from all the dying plants. Soon after, the trail opens into an area with tall trees but little underbrush. The path continues toward the rotting remains of a truly titanic tree and, under its roots, there appears to be a small cave. Unfortunately, there is danger here, blocking the PCs’ path. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.663,r=0.891,b=0.800), with ID cdeb99d0-a542-45b5-8dcc-3808c04ba04f -->

**Creatures:** In the center of the clearing is a trio of small, sickly-looking thorn bushes grouped together. If the PCs scrutinize the bushes from a distance of at least 30 feet, they can attempt DC 18 Perception checks to notice that there appears to be a wolf carcass on the ground between them, and the plants have wrapped their tendrils around the corpse. If the characters approach to within 20 feet, the bloodlash bushes shake violently and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.802,r=0.890,b=0.939), with ID f9e48c24-9d65-4ba8-b0cd-184cb8c3eceb -->

G2. FOUL DEN                                            SEVERE 2
After dealing with the bushes, the characters are
free to explore the den underneath the old, rotting
tree. Anyone approaching the opening picks up the
overpowering smell of wet and rotten fur coming
from the hole. Unfortunately, the hole is not quite
big enough for the PCs to enter without getting on
their hands and knees. Should the PCs climb inside,
read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.184,r=0.453,b=0.328), with ID 5b091057-76ff-411e-bed4-871b8b689636 -->

The narrow tunnel is slick with foul-smelling mud. It leads down into a cramped den lit by a shimmering pool of oily water. The chamber stinks of wet fur and sickness. Next to the pool, between the gnarled and dying tree roots, is the rotting carcass of what must have once been a truly gigantic wolf. Nosing around it is a pair of hairless mutant wolves, their bodies deformed by large pustules and tumors. Although they have no eyes, they clearly detect your presence, for they turn their heads at you and snarl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.338,r=0.452,b=0.482), with ID 7ee97b65-1ddb-40e3-b961-6b64d220688f -->

The glowing pool provides the chamber with dim
light. Without additional light, creatures lacking
darkvision or low-light vision treat all creatures as
concealed. Due to the low ceiling in this chamber,
Medium or larger creatures treat the entire area as
difficult terrain. The roots and moss hanging from
the ceiling make it so that any creature more than
5 feet away is screened from ranged attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.493,r=0.452,b=0.617), with ID d9301d94-3cb3-456d-ac21-c987c835a276 -->

**Creatures:** The mutant wolves are the last survivors of the pack that attacked the PCs, living here in the den with the corpse of their mother. They are hairless, eyeless, and their blood is an alchemical soup. They do not respond until two characters are in the room, but then they snarl and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.618,r=0.452,b=0.708), with ID 6f2516ca-c442-4368-94ad-e43203e53051 -->

Polluted Pool: Once the wolves are dealt with, the characters can freely investigate the glowing, oily pool in the center of the den. It is not particularly deep and is fed by a natural spring that wells up from deep below the ground. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting, or a DC 20 Nature or Occult check, recognizes that this water is tainted by something unnatural. A critical success on this check reveals that the chemicals are mutagenic in nature, causing those who drink it to change, often at a terrible price. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.219,r=0.819,b=0.371), with ID 07caf592-ce81-477b-9550-5f8a41e4aa03 -->

The water gives off an acrid smell, and anyone who touches it notices it has an odd, oily texture. Although it is not dangerous to touch once or twice, the water leaves the skin feeling prickly, and prolonged exposure quickly provokes a mild rash. Anyone foolish enough to drink the water must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save against the ingested toxin. A character that fails this save is sickened 1 for 1 hour. A character that critically fails also takes 1d6 acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.373,r=0.817,b=0.525), with ID 3cb4bd2e-3365-4244-bbee-192952ff2219 -->

**XP Award:** Discovering the polluted pool is an important step toward uncovering what is going on in the forest; award the party 30 XP for its discovery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.526,r=0.817,b=0.572), with ID 1735b9b4-95f9-4783-9325-7b4dfb7df548 -->

NOALA’S NEXT MOVE  
When the PCs are done in the Blighted Den, they find Noala burning a pair of mangy wolf bodies—stragglers that she caught trying to sneak out of the den after the PCs went in. She is eager to hear what the PCs discovered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.581,r=0.818,b=0.677), with ID fc6cc319-f035-48d2-935e-530cd4f1439d -->

She agrees that the water must be the source of the
pollution, but how the water is being contaminated
is still a mystery. Noala knows of no caves nearby
that contain access to any significant source of water.
Without an obvious lead, Noala suggests they travel
to the oldest, largest blight in these woods. This
will require a one-day journey through unforgiving
wilderness. She suggests they set off at once, but
she will wait until morning if the PCs would rather
return to Etran’s Folly to rest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.679,r=0.818,b=0.831), with ID 1a496d06-f98a-421a-bf16-0027ab7cdf3d -->

# THE PEN
Deep in the forest to the north of town is a blight larger
and older than any other. Noala became aware of it
only once the blight had spread. She has monitored
the blight’s growth, but she has never fully explored
this area, as it is home to ferocious predators. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.842,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 71d9db34-fac5-462e-b7dd-06627b41b93a -->

Summary : This is a detailed battle map for tabletop role-playing games, depicting a transition from an outdoor forested area into a cave complex with multiple labeled chambers and features.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a region transitioning from a grassy, wooded area (bottom/left) into a cave system (top/right).
  • A north arrow is present in the forested area, with a scale indicating 1 square = 5 feet.
  • The map is gridded for precise movement and measurement.

Keys & Annotations :
  • Labeled locations: H1 (forest clearing), H2 (stone circle or ritual site), H3 (cave entrance), H4 (main cave chamber with pool and cauldron), H5 (side chamber with beds), H6 (refuse or debris area), H7 (antechamber with stairs), H8 (large pen with altar or dais).
  • "THE PEN" is labeled at the top left, indicating a special area.
  • Multiple "V" and "X" markers are scattered in the forest, possibly denoting traps, points of interest, or encounter locations.
  • Furniture, objects, and terrain features are illustrated: trees, logs, rocks, beds, tables, cauldrons, and altars.
  • Pathways and stairs connect the outdoor and indoor areas.

Ordering :
  • The map is organized with the outdoor area at the bottom/left, leading northward into the cave system.
  • The cave complex is arranged with interconnected chambers, some with stairs or doors, culminating in the large pen at the top left.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical encounters, with clear transitions between open terrain and confined cave spaces.
  • The labeled areas suggest distinct encounter zones or objectives.
  • The presence of markers (V, X) in the forest may indicate ambush points or hidden features.
  • The cave system is linear but includes side chambers for exploration or narrative events. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=-0.000,r=0.999,b=0.994), with ID 91360596-0465-4156-b099-075b23dad38e -->

What Noala does not know is that this place was Vilree’s first home after leaving Etran’s Folly all those years ago. It was here that Vilree first experimented with her mother’s books and learned the basics of alchemy. Once her experiments outgrew these facilities, she looked for a new home and discovered a cavern complex in the foothills to the east she would later call “Spite’s Cradle.” Today she uses her old home here, now called the Pen, to test her concoctions on plants, animals and, more recently, humans, leaving much of the work to a small group of orcs that she enslaved three years ago. The brightest among the orcs has even begun experimenting with reagents, calling himself the Sculptor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.344), with ID 8e5067d8-4183-405d-b37b-2040f03e6556 -->

### Journey to the Pen
The journey to the Pen is long and challenging. If the group hopes to arrive before nightfall, they must take no exploration tactic other than movement, covering ground as quickly as possible. Even then, they arrive with only an hour of daylight remaining, and they may opt to wait until morning. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.352,r=0.454,b=0.464), with ID 539bcf84-1681-4454-b478-fd51b46a466b -->

When the PCs finally do reach the area, they
discover it resembles the blight surrounding the wolf
den. The plants on the perimeter are sickly and dying.
It is at this point that Noala again departs to patrol the
perimeter. Before the PCs venture inside, Noala offers
them 2 lesser healing potions and 2 barkskin potions.
After that, she heads off into the woods to begin her
preparations. The PCs can take whatever time they
need before pushing onward into the corruption. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.464,r=0.454,b=0.602), with ID bac74a7e-3a43-4c5a-b804-aa8024b96d24 -->

This blight is much stranger than the blight the
PCs visited before. Here, the corruption manifests in
distinct bands. The outer band is much like the area
around the wolf den, with rotting trees and dying
plants. Deeper in, all the plants have died; they are
limp and rotten, and the air stinks with sweet decay.
There are no birds or insects here, only the remains
of creatures desperate enough to eat the poisonous
plants. It takes just over 20 minutes to pass through
each of these two bands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.602,r=0.454,b=0.755), with ID a9e8829e-15ae-4ed0-8dc2-e3c4ae9877a0 -->

Finally, the PCs enter the third area, where smaller
trees and plants seem to have returned to twisted life.
Their leaves drip with an oily sap, their branches are
gnarled yet strangely pliable, and their bark looks
like scales. Many of these plants are covered in odd
pustules that emit a faintly glowing light, and biting
gnats swarm around them. Swatting these gnats causes
them to burst into tiny flames that do no damage but
emit a terrible smell. Once the PCs reach this area, it
takes 1 hour to locate the heart of the blight, but a
PC who succeeds at a DC 17 Survival check uncovers
faint boot tracks that reduce this time to 30 minutes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.755,r=0.454,b=0.941), with ID 5c786a36-7366-491b-8422-6400d31d9938 -->

The Pen is built into the side of a hill in the middle of a field of twisted, poisonous brambles. There is only one way in, passing through Vilree’s plant guardians. When the PCs approach, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.120,r=0.801,b=0.239), with ID 95c29a42-5d60-4bb1-9f73-c5521b6dbc62 -->

Deeper into this massive blight, the plants take on unnatural shades, and their branches seem to shudder and quake at the sensation of something passing. Up ahead is a wall of thick brambles with some sort of thorny iris in the center. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.246,r=0.819,b=0.315), with ID f463c927-e715-4dfa-9f8d-b6e53c880704 -->

The thorny iris is the doorway into the Pen itself,
but before the PCs can reach it, they must pass by a
number of forest guardians that have been cultivated
here to keep intruders away. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.324,r=0.819,b=0.387), with ID a2a32a37-4572-44f0-9ac4-492c829d0523 -->

Creatures: Clustered near the gate are four vine lashers (each indicated on the map with a V), small creeping plants each with one large fibrous tendril that can reach out and grab creatures. These plants wait to attack until the PCs are close, holding them near the poison blooms (see Hazards below) as long as possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.388,r=0.820,b=0.482), with ID e849c7a4-ab29-4845-9928-df3772def3ad -->

Hazards: There are three large, colorful plants called poison blooms here (each indicated on the map with an X). If a non-plant creature approaches within 10 feet of any of these poison blooms, all three of them each unleash a cloud of mindfuddle gas that spreads out to a range of 20 feet. The poisonous gas remains in the area for 1 minute, and the poison blooms need 10 minutes to recharge before they can expel this gas again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.554,r=0.820,b=0.680), with ID ca99866b-9ce0-4805-94f7-00a07a62eada -->

**Thorn Iris:** The players are left with one final obstacle before they can enter the Pen: the thorn iris. This doorway, made up of thorny branches winding clockwise in a broad circle, does not have a handle or keyhole. It instead opens when one particular branch in the pattern is twisted. The branch is the only one in the entire iris pattern that winds counter-clockwise, making finding it something of a puzzle. Locating this branch requires a successful DC 18 Nature check or DC 23 Perception check.

H2. The Yard                              Severe 2

On the other side of the wall of brambles is a yard dominated by three large, wooden cages and a pool of bubbling sludge. A wretched-looking horse stands in one <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.259,r=0.526,b=0.345), with ID 1a1ef429-efb4-491c-9e16-d271a64df0b6 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a horse composed entirely of stone, labeled "Stone Horse," depicted in a dynamic pose on a rocky surface.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a horse whose body, head, and limbs are made of rough, angular stone plates and segments.
  • The horse is rearing with its right foreleg raised, standing on a rocky outcrop.
  • The eyes glow with a yellowish light, adding a supernatural effect.
  • The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and muted earth tones, consistent with stone.
  • The background is mostly white, with some foliage visible on the left edge.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The label "Stone Horse" appears at the bottom right in a green box with white text.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible cracks and texture to emphasize the stone material.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The horse occupies the central and right portion of the image, with its head and raised leg drawing attention upward and to the right.
  • The rocky ground beneath the horse provides context and grounding for the pose.
  • The left side of the image is mostly empty except for some partial plant leaves.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of strength, durability, and magical or mythical qualities due to the stone composition and glowing eyes.
  • The dynamic pose suggests readiness or defiance, enhancing the fantastical nature of the creature.
  • The label "Stone Horse" clearly identifies the subject for viewers. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.350,r=0.552,b=0.911), with ID 1021fdb8-0f4b-42cb-8aa3-8d6a0d6acf18 -->

of the cages, while another cage is filled with a swarm
of gigantic rats covered in white blisters. The third pen
looks empty, but it appears to be built around a small cave
located in the hillside. There is another cave entrance on
the north side, near one of the pens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.125,r=0.891,b=0.205), with ID 72db0946-fbe3-4d50-92d9-c4c96e9ee81e -->

This yard is used by the orcs to house some
of their more successful experiments, and while
these creatures are not exactly loyal, they are
quite dangerous when allowed to run free. This is
especially true if the PCs gave the orcs here ample
warning of their approach by destroying the thorn
iris instead of finding a way to open it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.218,r=0.891,b=0.325), with ID 29fbe8e3-53dc-4a5c-8c69-e24042ea1e61 -->

**Creatures:** There are two orcs in this area as well as the caged experiments. If the PCs catch the orcs unaware, one of them is dumping a bucket of sludge into the pool when the PCs open the iris, while the other is in front of the horse’s cage (the northernmost cage on the map). When combat starts, the first orc flings his bucket at the nearest PC, a ranged attack with a +4 bonus that deals 1d6 acid damage plus 1 persistent acid damage. He then charges up to attack. Meanwhile, the second orc opens the horse’s cage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.479), with ID 78dd4e22-7d8b-4a6c-ba4e-0a4ff1d5b903 -->

If the PCs alert the orcs to their approach, both are positioned at a cage door—one at the door with the horse, the other perched atop the cage with the rats. The moment the door is breached, the orcs open their respective cages, making this an especially deadly battle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.480,r=0.891,b=0.571), with ID 9c05f6e4-dc53-48c1-9c9a-fd55f4b7ba36 -->

Opening a cage requires 2 actions (one to unlock the cage, and a second to open the door). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.565,t=0.571,r=0.890,b=0.602), with ID c71c4894-18bb-4a17-b030-a838017cc2a1 -->

North Cage: This cage contains a warhorse that the orcs have been experimenting on for some time now. Despite their ministrations and the creature’s half-starved condition, the beast is loyal to them. Its flesh has a stony appearance and its hooves appear to be made of metal. The moment the horse’s cage is open, it dashes forward to attack. If for some reason the door is not opened, the horse grows very agitated as the orcs are slain. When the last of them falls, it rears up to shatter the door of its pen and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.679,r=0.892,b=0.861), with ID 0e257663-a957-426b-9e90-d71843f6258b -->

**Icy Death** When an icy rat is slain, its body explodes in a burst of frozen fur and bone, dealing 2d4 cold damage to all adjacent creatures (DC 14 basic Reflex save). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.587,r=0.445,b=0.649), with ID 1d6c4c47-30b4-4eac-a6c1-36860f2e86d7 -->

**South Cage:** This cage appears to be empty, but the floor is littered with the bones of previous inhabitants and scraps from the meals that fed them. There is an opening in the back wall of the cage that leads to area **H3**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.663,r=0.452,b=0.740), with ID 1ec1107d-c79c-48bd-b26e-fa2de96c407d -->

Hazard: The large pool of toxic sludge in the center of this area is a hazard to any who draw near. Randomly determine the direction of the wind at the start of the fight by rolling 1d8; a result of 1 indicates the wind is blowing north, a 2 is northeast, and so on, moving clockwise to an 8, which indicates the wind is blowing northwest. The fumes are especially strong in the direction indicated, creating a draft that stretches 20 feet from the pool. Any creature that starts its turn in this draft takes 1d4 acid damage and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (falling into or entering the pool deals an extra 1d4 acid damage in addition to the normal effect). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.740,r=0.452,b=0.940), with ID d5c9802f-4604-4b62-8b4a-8c5ee38a659c -->

Each round, check to see if the wind shifts
slightly by rolling 1d8; on a result of 1–2,
the wind shifts one direction clockwise (from
south to southwest, for example), on a result of
3–6 it stays the same, and on a result of 7–8 it
shifts one direction counterclockwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.126,r=0.790,b=0.218), with ID 369599cf-b7de-4c80-ae49-b140e1062c83 -->

Regardless of the wind direction and the acid  
fumes, anyone adjacent to the toxic pool at the start  
of their turn takes 1d4 acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.219,r=0.817,b=0.264), with ID cabd53a9-6c68-4c39-8b5e-e67c3b4a747c -->

### H3. The Black Cave
This cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.276,r=0.818,b=0.372), with ID d5603afb-b283-4581-b334-a1a5163a7fd6 -->

Opening the cage door does not anger the leopard or cause it to attack. Instead, it waits inside the cave, in agony from experiments performed upon it by the orcs. When the PCs enter the cave, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.373,r=0.819,b=0.450), with ID 3016c96e-cf44-46d1-abe0-f54cfd3c8800 -->

Stepping inside the cave, a cloud of smoke hovering around the ceiling becomes visible. Curled up in the back of the cave is a cat that looks to be on fire. It glares at the sight of another creature entering, letting out a weak snarl that fades into a plaintive yowl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.462,r=0.818,b=0.543), with ID 5f553069-cab1-4923-88bf-6797f1125337 -->

**Creature:** The fiery leopard is in far too much pain to fight the PCs unless they provoke it. Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation. A character trained in Nature can approach the leopard and calm it with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy skill check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check. A critical failure on this check causes it to attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.819,b=0.678), with ID 78eb30dc-15db-4e17-8a1c-2bfa0a9340db -->
