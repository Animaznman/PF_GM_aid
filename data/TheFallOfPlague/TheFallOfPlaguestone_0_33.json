Etran’s Folly never truly\nrecovered. This fact led many to refer to the town as\n“Plaguestone”—a reference to a stone marker in town\nonce used to safely give food to the sick and dying.\nVillagers left food at the stone and, in return, the sick\nplaced coins in a hole in the stone, filling the hole with\nvinegar to cleanse the copper and silver of any trace\nof the plague. Now, many of the town’s homes and\nbusinesses are empty, their residents long dead save\nfor a few orphans taken in by neighbors or left to fend\nfor themselves on the fringes of the community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.187,r=0.456,b=0.448), with ID 2799d4cb-d7b8-4dca-98db-058269d4ee8e -->\n\nWhen the plague came to Etran’s Folly, Silwyth Eldara did all she could with herbalism and alchemy to find a cure. Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran’s Folly for their treatment of her mother.\n\nOver the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran’s Folly; stained by her mother’s reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone they where denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.448,r=0.456,b=0.817), with ID e713e247-1268-4d5c-9338-1dbe581baabf -->\n\nADVENTURE SUMMARY  \nThe adventure begins with the PCs traveling to Etran’s Folly in the caravan of Bort Bargith, a dwarf merchant who agreed to take them on as passengers. Just outside town, the caravan is attacked by a pack of wolves, the vicious leader of which spews acid. Arriving in town after helping to save the caravan, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.824,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID 3ababa81-09b2-4efe-bb75-fcfc526a474f -->\n\nthe characters are invited to dinner by Bort,\nwho wishes to reward them for their valor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.188,r=0.779,b=0.220), with ID 118dd76e-25c1-4424-a4b3-9080808c29f2 -->\n\nWhile enjoying dinner with the PCs, Bort is\npoisoned, dying within moments from a virulent\ntoxin hidden in his food. The local sheriff, Rolth\nGarley, is out of his depth, and insists on holding the\ncaravan in town until the scheduled arrival of a circuit\njudge a month in the future. But the heroes have a\nchance to investigate the murder and they explore\nthe town, talking to everyone who was present for\nthe poisoning. Eventually, it becomes clear that\nPhinick, the goblin kitchen assistant, poisoned the\nfood. He quickly confesses once apprehended, but\ninsists he thought he was only putting a special spice\nin the food, not poison. Further questioning reveals\nthat Hallod, the town bully, coerced him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.220,r=0.820,b=0.433), with ID 18d606ed-8444-4705-b17b-b1d2dc54a865 -->\n\nHallod’s hideout reveals that he is more than he seems. The town bully is in fact an agent of Vilree, who pays him with gold and doses of an addictive mutagen. Defeating Hallod may help the town and clear the names of everyone involved with the merchant’s death, but it leads the heroes no closer to Vilree, who ordered the murder. In fact, Hallod hasn’t seen Vilree in over a year. The goods and supplies he acquired for her were always delivered to a prearranged drop spot in a hollow stump. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.434,r=0.820,b=0.587), with ID 64ef1e34-62a0-4f00-af0d-cc077431763a -->\n\nAbout this time, Noala Kesrir, an elven ranger\nthat patrols the lands around town, contacts the\ncharacters. She found the wolves slain earlier by\nthe PCs and noticed the taint affecting the corpses\nis similar to a number of blighted areas that have\nappeared in the woods near town. She seeks out the\ncharacters, hoping they might help her investigate\nthese blighted areas. This leads them to the Pen, where\nVilree had been experimenting on animals and plants.\nShutting down this testing ground is dangerous, but in\ndoing so the PCs find a map that leads to Vilree’s lair,\na place known only as Spite’s Cradle. Only one of the\nlandmarks on the map is familiar, though: the hollow\nstump where Hallod left supplies for Vilree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.587,r=0.820,b=0.801), with ID 0ce185d0-9b2d-49ce-908a-5a881da34999 -->\n\nUsing the map and information from Hallod, the group can make their way to Spite’s Cradle in the hills nearby. There, they learn of Vilree’s plot to infect the town with a terrifying plague. Worse still, the plague is already in town—hidden inside the plaguestone—and she has already sent a servant to trigger the explosion that will release the disease! After defeating the alchemist, the heroes must race back to town in time to save everyone from Vilree’s final revenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.802,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID b511c783-049e-488b-a6d0-0030d7c90631 -->\n\nSummary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar or chapter divider from a fantasy adventure book, listing the main parts of the adventure and an \"Adventure Toolbox\" section, all framed by a stylized, organic, purple-blue border with fantasy alchemical motifs.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical, ornate sidebar with a fantasy theme, featuring a purple-blue, organic, slime-like border with glowing orange sparkles and a green potion flask at the top.\n  • The interior contains a parchment-like panel listing four sections: \"Part 1: A Mysterious Murder\", \"Part 2: The Ranger's Request\", \"Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair\", and \"Adventure Toolbox\".\n  • At the bottom, a small potion bottle and scroll are illustrated within the border.\n  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and parchment tan, with highlights of orange and yellow.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation.\n  • All text is legible and presented in a fantasy-style serif font.\n  • The illustration is vertically oriented and highly stylized, with no photographic elements.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The potion flask and leafy vines are at the top, the parchment panel is centered, and the potion bottle and scroll are at the bottom.\n  • The border frames the text, creating a sense of enclosure and focus on the adventure sections.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration is designed to evoke a magical, alchemical atmosphere, guiding the reader through the adventure's structure in a visually engaging way.

There are faster and easier routes south, but for those seeking to avoid Cheliax, this is the safest. Bort Bargith is a dwarf trader from the Five Kings Mountains, welcome in many settlements for his fair prices and gregarious spirit, and he has been using this route for years.

The mangy wolves do not\npresent much of a threat, but the caustic wolf is\na dangerous foe that can seriously hurt the player\ncharacters. Fortunately, the wolves do not use\neffective tactics. They do not intentionally move\ninto flanking positions, nor do they single out\nweak characters. The caustic wolf uses his howl\nearly in the fight and his acid breath only once he\nhas been damaged. Should the fight turn against\nthe players, Olf and Ulf might show up to draw\nthe wolves off for a round or two, giving the PCs\na chance to regroup.\n\nMost importantly, emphasize the sights,\nsounds, and smells of the fight. The wolves snarl\nwith hunger and smell like filthy hounds. The mud\nflies when characters charge across the damp\ntrail. Fangs tear nasty wounds, and warhammers\ncrunch bones. Play up any critical hits and\nexaggerate the failures.

If anyone was dealt lethal wounds during the fight, they pull through thanks to Delma’s skill at Medicine, although the sheriff has strong words for anyone who resorted to such tactics on mostly helpless farm folk.

Dessert was served before the fight began, and Bort proclaims to all that the turnip porridge here is his favorite, which explains the extra large bowl of it sitting before him. In fact, his bowl is unique in more ways than one—it's also poisoned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.813,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID 776d32c6-7c9b-446b-81a7-d121db714cb1 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.309,t=0.987,r=0.692,b=1.000), with ID cd5b16f6-5cf2-44a0-a8b4-47038c3d197c -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.305,t=0.001,r=0.694,b=0.015), with ID f9a4c05b-78f9-4624-be1a-36f67dd1ef1e -->\n\nPoisoned Dessert: Just a few minutes into his dessert, Bort begins to cough and choke. Playing this off as a bit of indigestion, he continues whatever tale he was in the middle of telling. A few moments later it is clear, as the coughing returns, that he is in distress. He begins to turn purple and his mouth begins frothing. Seconds after, his eyes roll into his head and a rumble can be heard in his guts. Mere moments thereafter, he collapses onto the table and dies. The characters might attempt to aid him using Medicine. A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Medicine check determines that Bort is not choking on anything, but that his windpipe has swollen shut, indicating that he has been poisoned. Allow an extra Medicine check to use Treat Poison (against the virulent poison’s DC of 24) to help Bort attempt his Fortitude save to resist, but the amount put in his porridge is just too great, and even if his throat is somehow opened so he can breathe, he still fails every save against the poison and dies (22 Hit Points, Fortitude Save +6). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.454,b=0.433), with ID bc16202e-6976-41ec-809d-1260298b1858 -->\n\nFortunately for the PCs, should any of them\naccidentally ingest some of the poison, only trace\namounts remain in the bowl.

As they witness the PCs trying to help,\nit’s clear the PCs were not responsible, but at first,\neveryone is just concerned for the dwarf’s well-being.\nOnce it’s clear he is dead, the tavern goes silent, and\neveryone begins eyeing one another (and their food). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.663,r=0.452,b=0.816), with ID 87a11ddd-2816-4ae4-bf1c-9d1ae57f43f7 -->\n\nRolph’s Investigation  \nAs the town’s only real member of law enforcement, Rolth Garley is incompetent. He is the mayor’s nephew and rarely does anything other than settle disputes over livestock and break up the occasional drunken brawl.

The members of the\ncaravan who would inherit the lucrative business are\nhigh on the list of suspects, but most were not in the\nbar, and those that were—Olf and Ulf—have solid\nalibis: they were drinking and gambling with Eallom\nbefore and after the fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.250,r=0.818,b=0.387), with ID 076b207a-f420-4674-a5fb-e65b92484f23 -->\n\nFeel free to modify this interrogation according to\nthe actions of the players. Rolth grants requests that\nare likely to further the investigation, but he will not\nstart questioning other townsfolk until he has first\ninterrogated the PCs and other caravan members.

As the town has no jail, he informs everyone he will need to turn this investigation over to a circuit judge who visits the town occasionally to deal with serious legal matters and crimes. Unfortunately, the judge, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, is not due back for another month, so everyone is stuck here until then. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.541,r=0.817,b=0.677), with ID fd2aea25-f08e-4f07-a305-8480f181d330 -->\n\nIf the PCs protest, Rolth insists that unless he\nknows who committed this heinous crime, he is\nbound to hold all possible suspects until the judge\narrives.

Bort’s body is taken down to the cellar to be kept cool, while Tamli and the rest of the caravan gathers to mourn. She invites the characters to join them out near the wagons. This is a somber occasion, and everyone in the company is at a loss. Bort was their leader, and without him, their future is uncertain.

Fixing wagons and moving goods, that’s my job.

They can search the Feedmill for clues, they can go through Bort’s ledgers, and they can talk to various witnesses and suspects around town. Each of these approaches is described below. Although there is plenty of time before the circuit judge arrives, Tamli and the other caravan members instill a sense of urgency. No one wants to remain in this town an hour longer than they have to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.326,r=0.524,b=0.464), with ID 6802fd22-332e-43d3-b931-8d1246926b13 -->\n\nSearching the Feedmill  \nOne of the obvious places to start the investigation is the Feedmill itself. After the events of the previous night, the common room was tidied up a bit, but the kitchen is in complete disarray. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.476,r=0.524,b=0.555), with ID 85ca6528-d479-4047-8ae3-2be6780255ec -->\n\n**Dining Room:** There is little to be found here that relates to Bort’s death. The poisoned bowl was taken to the kitchen, and there is nothing remarkable about the table or chair where Bort perished. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.556,r=0.523,b=0.617), with ID 264a0a66-1c79-4c5d-b38f-a327f5a0f3d7 -->\n\nKitchen: The kitchen contains the cooking utensils needed to operate the Feedmill—kettles, skillets, knives, a mortar and pestle, roasting spits, a sieve, and a butter churner. Of particular note is the kettle of turnip porridge sitting on the counter, next to Bort’s large bowl. Although the remnants are starting to dry out, a PC who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check notices an unusual, faintly floral, smell in the porridge remaining in Bort’s bowl. Checking all the herbs in the kitchen doesn’t uncover a match, nor is the smell similar to that of ground clove and anise in the mortar and pestle that was used to spice the dishes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.618,r=0.523,b=0.800), with ID 52306256-9fd3-40fb-9e1b-fed8d36be86c -->\n\n**Cellar:** Down in the cellar, alongside a number of large casks of ale and a few old, dusty bottles of wine, is the body of Bort Bargith. His flesh has turned an odd blue color in death, and anyone checking gets the faintest impression of a floral odor from the body. There is nothing else here to be learned that could not be uncovered when he was dying. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.802,r=0.523,b=0.907), with ID d5f44908-2e29-4d4d-a0a2-8e23124de529 -->\n\n**The Grounds:** There is not much to be gained searching the grounds.

Searching the yard outside the\nbarn does reveal one very important clue: a PC who\nsucceeds at a DC 15 Perception check spots a glint\nin the grass just outside the stable doors, leading to a\nsmall glass vial with a simple cork. The vial is empty\nbut contains traces of a floral-smelling liquid. This is\nthe vial that Phinick used to season Bort’s porridge, and\nhe dropped it here when he fled during the bar brawl.

Tamli has the keys to Bort’s wagon and will let the PCs inside, but she will not tolerate them ransacking the place. She remains very protective of Bort’s memory and reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.293,r=0.891,b=0.401), with ID ed218b99-e047-4de2-854e-e9c3f84ebbe9 -->\n\nInside, Bort’s wagon is filled with knickknacks and keepsakes from his journeys. His belongings are truly a bewildering assortment of odds and ends, including a bottle with a tiny skull floating in oil, a taxidermic dragon whelp, a mummified owlbear paw, a shining crystal that holds the illusionary image of a mountain peak inside, and so on. There are a number of minor magic trinkets in here, but Tamli will not allow the players to take or examine these at all. The merchant’s ledgers are easily found in a rack above his bed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.404,r=0.890,b=0.554), with ID d7fa67fc-1606-4259-9bbf-f537f2043d1a -->\n\nThe books are large and filled to the brim with details about his travels and transactions over many years. Acquiring any useful information from them takes at least 4 hours and requires a successful DC 18 Decipher Writing check (using Society or a related Lore skill). A PC who succeeds at this check uncovers that Bort visited Etran’s Folly at least 22 times in the past decade, and about five years ago the merchant started making deliveries labeled “reagents” to someone referred to only as “H,” receiving rather large sums of gold in exchange. These deliveries are numbered, starting with 1 and ending with delivery number 14, which occurred the day the caravan arrived in town. If the PCs fail to decipher the ledger, they can try again until they find what they are looking for. Each attempt takes 4 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.557,r=0.890,b=0.799), with ID 322ad1b9-36e2-48b6-8eee-4ca460de1027 -->\n\n**XP Award:** If the PCs uncover the deliveries made to the mysterious “H,” award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.801,r=0.889,b=0.831), with ID 623f41e6-33c4-4b34-a358-1f0daee010c4 -->\n\nQuestioning Amora                Trivial 1\nAfter Bort’s death, Amora tells Delma that the kitchen should be closed immediately, just in case it was the food.

Targen opened the Feedmill more than 50 years ago, before the Goblinblood Wars. His brother died in that conflict, along with much of Targen’s extended family. The town itself avoided the worst of the conflict, which occurred primarily to the west.

Targen can tell the PCs much about the plague that came to Etran’s Folly. He recounts how everyone suspected a local witch named Silwyth of starting the plague (she was actually an alchemist, but Targen has no idea what that is), and after Silwyth caught it herself, she cursed the town’s only priest before she died. Soon after, Father Bolgrist contracted the plague and died. Targen tells the PCs that the witch had a daughter named Vilree who stuck around her mother’s home for a few years, then probably died or ran off. Targen does not bother to recount the fact that Silwyth tried to stop the plague, or that Father Bolgrist was the first to accuse Silwyth of spreading it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.495,r=0.525,b=0.724), with ID 52003e81-9e1b-4aec-8d21-f5efca2530fb -->\n\n**Dead Homes:** After visiting the plaguestone, Targen guides the PCs through the north side of town where most of the plague victims lived. Most of their homes are empty and in a terrible state of disrepair. Only the very poor or desperate call this part of town home.

He claims that druids used to gather at the shrine long ago. Since Father Bolgrist’s death, nobody worships here anymore. Unfortunately, the area is overrun by wilderness, and the shrine is home to a group of hungry bloodseekers (see Creatures in area C below).\n\n**Etran’s Hill:** On the way back home, the path leads past Etran’s Hill. Looming to the town’s southeast, this hill was the site of the first home built in the area. Targen notes that Etran spent his fortune founding the town, only to die in a fire that consumed him and his family because the house was too far away from the well and the river.

The bully told Phinick that the spices\nwould only make Bort sick: a little payback for a\nbad deal he made with the merchant the last time he\nwas in town.

The Yard  \nThe yard around the house is choked with weeds and debris from the collapsed house. The area around the willow tree is all but impassible, as the dead branches and leaves have made a large heap around its trunk. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check reveals that someone frequents the property; their trail leads up to the front door, circles the house, and leads down to the stream. A critical success on this check uncovers that the trail never actually goes in through the poorly latched front door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.384,r=0.452,b=0.556), with ID ac454053-ba85-4335-ba9e-cf9185416a87 -->\n\nF2. FRONT DOOR  \nThe front door to the house no longer sits properly in its frame and is kept from swinging wide open by a simple rope attached to the inside latch.

HIDDEN WINDOW ENTRANCE  \nThe footpath that leads around the house passes under a boarded-over window at the back of the house, then down to the stream where Hallod gets water.

A critical success at this check also reveals a small glass bottle filled with a murky, foul-smelling brown liquid. Identifying this liquid requires a DC 19 Crafting skill check.

HALLOD’S HOME  \nThis chamber is entered via a short hallway remarkable only for a large steel wheel on the wall; this opens the iron gate in area F5, behind which Hallod keeps his dogs. A viewing slit in the door to area F5 allows one to see into that room. Hallod flees immediately after releasing his guard dogs. He moves quickly through this area, exiting into the caves beyond where there are additional defenses and, more importantly, his stash of juggernaut mutagen. This leaves his living quarters unattended, but searching for clues here will take time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.430,r=0.453,b=0.616), with ID c1a7b359-0161-4b1a-a3f1-2cc14c0843e4 -->\n\nThe home is divided into three areas: the larder, the lavatory, and the living space. The larder is a simple storeroom filled with scraps of old meat, a third of a wheel of cheese, a sack of turnips, and a barrel of weak ale. There is also a crate of empty wine bottles in one corner. They are all of a good Chelish vintage and were probably quite valuable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.617,r=0.452,b=0.724), with ID d0d5f15a-de7e-4e59-9dff-4e2245bf93b5 -->\n\nThe lavatory sits just off the main living space, and it is little more than an open pit. This is also where Hallod disposes of his garbage, and there are scraps of moldy food and bits of junk in the corners of the room. Anyone who investigates can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to notice that there are a number of small, identical bottles scattered among the trash. Examining the bottles reveals they all have a silvery residue in the bottom that smells strongly of iron and something else terribly acrid. A successful DC 15 Crafting check reveals this to be remnants of a juggernaut mutagen. A critical success on this check uncovers that there is also something sweet-smelling in the mix.

She listens with rapt attention, the knuckles on her clenched hands white with tension, as the story unfolds. Although she is relieved that the man directly responsible for Bort’s death has been caught, she grows quiet at the revelation that there was someone else involved. After a moment of silence, she asks how the PCs plan to find the mastermind behind all this, expecting the group to continue the search.

The PCs are free to question him, but he refuses to say much of anything until the withdrawal from his mutagen addiction begins to take hold, which takes 3 or 4 days.

It was here that Vilree first experimented with her mother’s books and learned the basics of alchemy. Once her experiments outgrew these facilities, she looked for a new home and discovered a cavern complex in the foothills to the east she would later call “Spite’s Cradle.” Today she uses her old home here, now called the Pen, to test her concoctions on plants, animals and, more recently, humans, leaving much of the work to a small group of orcs that she enslaved three years ago.

When the last of them falls, it rears up to shatter the door of its pen and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.679,r=0.892,b=0.861), with ID 0e257663-a957-426b-9e90-d71843f6258b -->\n\nSTONE HORSE        CREATURE 2\n\nPerception +6; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet\nSkills Acrobatics +5, Athletics +10 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.873,r=0.893,b=0.940), with ID f6c98a64-622f-4af5-ab25-d2493225e4e0 -->\n\n30 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.938,r=0.072,b=0.954), with ID f7941935-ece5-485d-aca3-374d615257b2 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animazuman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.308,t=0.986,r=0.693,b=1.000), with ID a0e648f2-8c7b-4e55-a950-d64acbdfe053 -->\n\n*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.304,t=0.001,r=0.695,b=0.016), with ID 168d4e22-3ef7-49e8-acb4-d37f780ebf79 -->\n\nSummary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar featuring a stylized, alchemical-themed chapter or section list for an adventure module, with fantasy artwork and a vertical sequence of labeled parts.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical, ornate frame resembling purple-blue alchemical slime or magical ooze, with embedded glass vials, a book, and leafy elements at the top.\n  • The frame encloses a parchment-like panel listing four adventure sections: \"Part 1: A Mysterious Murder\", \"Part 2: The Ranger's Request\", \"Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair\", and \"Adventure Toolbox\".\n  • The artwork is vibrant, with glowing highlights and fantasy motifs, suggesting a magical or alchemical theme.\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.\n  • The text is clear and legible, centered within the illustrated frame.\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The list is arranged vertically, with each part sequentially from top to bottom.\n  • Decorative elements (vials, book, leaves) are integrated into the border, with the book and vial at the bottom, and leafy growth at the top.\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for an adventure, using fantasy and alchemical motifs to enhance immersion and visual appeal.

The Black Cave\nThis cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.276,r=0.818,b=0.372), with ID d5603afb-b283-4581-b334-a1a5163a7fd6 -->\n\nOpening the cage door does not anger the leopard or cause it to attack.

Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation.

Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran’s Folly for their treatment of her mother.\n\nOver the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran’s Folly; stained by her mother’s reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone they where denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran’s Folly.",

The caravan consists of six covered wagons, four of which are laden with supplies, trade goods, and trinkets. Bort makes his home in the lead wagon and the cabin built onto its back, while the final wagon is for passengers and the cook.",
