illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a lively and chaotic tavern brawl involving several people.
  • The setting is an old-fashioned tavern with wooden furniture, a stone floor, and a wall-mounted oil lamp providing warm, low lighting.

Summary : This is a decorative title banner for "The Fall of Plaguestone," featuring stylized plant and vine artwork above and around the text.

logo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is the title "THE FALL OF PLAGEUSTONE" in large, dark green serif font, centered on a light wooden plank background.

Analysis : 
  • The banner uses organic, overgrown motifs to suggest a theme of nature, decay, or magical infestation, fitting for a fantasy adventure titled "The Fall of Plaguestone." The design is intended to be eye-catching and thematic, rather than to convey data or process information. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.010,t=0.028,r=0.709,b=0.170), with ID 87765611-a30f-475b-a7ad-1f512d2d23f2 -->

The town of Etran’s Folly has never had it easy.
Located far from popular trade routes, it has
never been more than a stopover point for
merchants making their way from Elidir to Almas.
Worse still, after the Goblinblood Wars, the town
suffered terribly from a plague outbreak that killed
almost half the population. Etran’s Folly never truly
recovered. This fact led many to refer to the town as
“Plaguestone”—a reference to a stone marker in town
once used to safely give food to the sick and dying.
Villagers left food at the stone and, in return, the sick
placed coins in a hole in the stone, filling the hole with
vinegar to cleanse the copper and silver of any trace
of the plague. Now, many of the town’s homes and
businesses are empty, their residents long dead save
for a few orphans taken in by neighbors or left to fend
for themselves on the fringes of the community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.187,r=0.456,b=0.448), with ID 87aa42f6-e8db-45bd-999d-dab4e3660c58 -->

When the plague came to Etran’s Folly, Silwyth Eldara did all she could with herbalism and alchemy to find a cure. Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran’s Folly for their treatment of her mother.

Over the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran’s Folly; stained by her mother’s reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone where they denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.448,r=0.456,b=0.817), with ID 0e5b7e39-7680-43ef-8952-5df5ba9581a6 -->

ADVENTURE SUMMARY  
The adventure begins with the PCs traveling to Etran’s Folly in the caravan of Bort Bargith, a dwarf merchant who agreed to take them on as passengers. Just outside town, the caravan is attacked by a pack of wolves, the vicious leader of which spews acid. Arriving in town after helping to save the caravan, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.824,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID c5cd6b6a-5802-49a6-9480-b2121f9e1881 -->

the characters are invited to dinner by Bort,
who wishes to reward them for their valor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.188,r=0.779,b=0.220), with ID 19024413-b108-4110-9435-af324cec3987 -->

While enjoying dinner with the PCs, Bort is
poisoned, dying within moments from a virulent
toxin hidden in his food. The local sheriff, Rolth
Garley, is out of his depth, and insists on holding the
caravan in town until the scheduled arrival of a circuit
judge a month in the future. But the heroes have a
chance to investigate the murder and they explore
the town, talking to everyone who was present for
the poisoning. Eventually, it becomes clear that
Phinick, the goblin kitchen assistant, poisoned the
food. He quickly confesses once apprehended, but
insists he thought he was only putting a special spice
in the food, not poison. Further questioning reveals
that Hallod, the town bully, coerced him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.220,r=0.820,b=0.433), with ID ce1a12c1-6e17-4fb5-a3e8-756a11ccd1b4 -->

Hallod’s hideout reveals that he is more than he seems. The town bully is in fact an agent of Vilree, who pays him with gold and doses of an addictive mutagen. Defeating Hallod may help the town and clear the names of everyone involved with the merchant’s death, but it leads the heroes no closer to Vilree, who ordered the murder. In fact, Hallod hasn’t seen Vilree in over a year. The goods and supplies he acquired for her were always delivered to a prearranged drop spot in a hollow stump. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.434,r=0.820,b=0.587), with ID feab8554-9560-41c5-8032-faaec2827c3f -->

About this time, Noala Kesrir, an elven ranger that patrols the lands around town, contacts the characters. She found the wolves slain earlier by the PCs and noticed the taint affecting the corpses is similar to a number of blighted areas that have appeared in the woods near town. She seeks out the characters, hoping they might help her investigate these blighted areas. This leads them to the Pen, where Vilree had been experimenting on animals and plants. Shutting down this testing ground is dangerous, but in doing so the PCs find a map that leads to Vilree’s lair, a place known only as Spite’s Cradle. Only one of the landmarks on the map is familiar, though: the hollow stump where Hallod left supplies for Vilree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.587,r=0.820,b=0.801), with ID 2ce33dd6-b577-4862-9d60-bd9f33f2e5d9 -->

Using the map and information from Hallod, the
group can make their way to Spite’s Cradle in the hills
nearby. There, they learn of Vilree’s plot to infect the
town with a terrifying plague. Worse still, the plague
is already in town—hidden inside the plaguestone—
and she has already sent a servant to trigger the
explosion that will release the disease! After defeating
the alchemist, the heroes must race back to town in
time to save everyone from Vilree’s final revenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.802,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID 43369064-091c-4dd0-9745-b1abc0b1b557 -->

The adventure begins as the caravan travels south by southeast from Elidir, the capital of Isger, to Almas, the capital of Andoran, on a road between the Apsodell Mountains and the Five Kings range. There are faster and easier routes south, but for those seeking to avoid Cheliax, this is the safest. Bort Bargith is a dwarf trader from the Five Kings Mountains, welcome in many settlements for his fair prices and gregarious spirit, and he has been using this route for years. The caravan consists of six covered wagons, four of which are laden with supplies, trade goods, and trinkets. Bort makes his home in the lead wagon and the cabin built onto its back, while the final wagon is for passengers and the cook. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.570,r=0.526,b=0.786), with ID 629a7211-6675-4fc0-91bf-ec1a8eeeea07 -->

The PCs are all passengers in this caravan, though
if one of them has the teamster background (page 55),
they might be working for it instead, driving the final
wagon. They share the last wagon with the food, the
camp chef Cooky, and a couple of other passengers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.786,r=0.524,b=0.862), with ID f09c4cd7-a050-44e5-8066-8523f8f6defb -->

The travelers do not necessarily know each other
at the start of the adventure, although some of them
could be acquainted. None of them are particularly
familiar with Bort, the caravan master, or any of
the other teamsters. The caravan is less than a day <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.862,r=0.524,b=0.940), with ID abc9594d-9208-4109-af30-91c4e0fabd45 -->

arrive by nightfall so that the weary travelers can at
least enjoy one night in town, sleeping in a real bed

Falcon’s Hollow. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.572,r=0.892,b=0.647), with ID 797977d4-04d3-4845-a407-a85ee4a8e545 -->

When you are ready to begin play, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.648,r=0.891,b=0.680), with ID 082045f6-8256-49c4-abca-5b680d95ceb4 -->

It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into the back of one of Bort Bargith’s wagons bound for the faraway Andoran capital of Almas. The smiling caravan master cut your travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise. Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.694,r=0.890,b=0.815), with ID 5696ec27-b8e5-40c6-81f9-dd0be3491c07 -->

As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive at the town of Etran’s Folly by nightfall, and he promised a comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day’s travel. The caravan’s teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.817,r=0.890,b=0.940), with ID 40069eca-5df4-4eed-ba90-e0698dcf28c2 -->

At this point, allow the characters to introduce themselves to one another and describe their appearances. This is also a good time to briefly describe the other members of the caravan and the countryside through which they travel. For more information on the members of Bort’s caravan, see page 54. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.218), with ID e5e92dee-080a-417f-b06a-c1ff532d58ac -->

This part of Isger is sparsely populated, consisting of small rural farms and isolated communities. It is a temperate land, with frequent light rains and the rich smell of damp earth wafting on the pleasant breeze. The trail winds its way through the lowlands, passing along streams and through small forests. The game in this area has only recently recovered after years of war drove it into hiding. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.219,r=0.455,b=0.342), with ID c9f492a8-b83c-46ae-aea6-3fc048eff89d -->

If pressed about their behavior after Bort’s announcement, the teamsters quietly explain that the accommodations in Etran’s Folly are hardly better than the ground outside, and the smell is even worse. Except for Glunda, they all refer to the town as “Plaguestone” due to the virulent plague that nearly wiped out the community 20 years ago, although none are so rude as to use that name in front of the locals.

Late in the afternoon, the caravan is attacked! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.342,r=0.455,b=0.479), with ID 1d373434-9833-4977-b144-bd18374030cb -->

A. MANGY PACK                              SEVERE 1

“Up ahead is Plaguestone,” Keldaran shouts from the front of the wagon. No sooner does the call fade from his lips than it is overshadowed by a series of long, mournful howls emanating from the woods to either side of the caravan. Moments later, you hear cries of panic as a pack of mangy wolves descends from the forest with teeth bared! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.490,r=0.454,b=0.638), with ID 0a32d2fc-e0d8-4c1e-93be-d0a1c5502459 -->

**Creatures:** Although there are over a dozen wolves attacking the caravan, only three approach the wagon containing the PCs. At the end of the first round in which a mangy wolf is killed, the caustic wolf emerges from the forest to join the fight (roll Perception for its initiative as normal and insert it in the next round); it howls the moment it is near the characters. Once the caustic wolf is slain, all other wolves (including any fighting the PCs) flee into the woods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.679,r=0.454,b=0.818), with ID f7d1e2ae-7b61-4ca4-9350-2e59dab82ca5 -->

FIRST FIGHT
As the battle with the wolves is the first
time the PCs have entered battle, it is important
to take your time and ensure that the combat
is fun and engaging. The mangy wolves do not
present much of a threat, but the caustic wolf is
a dangerous foe that can seriously hurt the player
characters. Fortunately, the wolves do not use
effective tactics. They do not intentionally move
into flanking positions, nor do they single out
weak characters. The caustic wolf uses his howl
early in the fight and his acid breath only once he
has been damaged. Should the fight turn against
the players, Olf and Ulf might show up to draw
the wolves off for a round or two, giving the PCs
a chance to regroup.
     Most importantly, emphasize the sights,
sounds, and smells of the fight. The wolves snarl
with hunger and smell like filthy hounds. The mud
flies when characters charge across the damp
trail. Fangs tear nasty wounds, and warhammers
crunch bones. Play up any critical hits and
exaggerate the failures. Make sure everyone’s
first fight is one they will vividly remember. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.110,r=0.816,b=0.504), with ID 263ea40d-02d2-458a-9dda-242b19d22c7d -->

Summary : This is a gridded battle map illustration for tabletop role-playing games, depicting a forested road with two horse-drawn wagons and a labeled area called "Mangy Pack." The map includes a scale reference indicating that each square represents 5 feet.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map shows a winding dirt road running from the bottom center to the top right, surrounded by dense green forest.
  • The grid overlay divides the map into squares, each labeled as 5 feet per square.
  • The visible area covers a section of the road with two wagons and a fork or bend in the path.
  • The label "MANGY PACK" appears in the upper left forested area, possibly indicating a point of interest or encounter location.

Keys & Annotations :
  • "MANGY PACK" is the only on-map annotation, placed in the upper left.
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" is written in the lower right corner as a scale reference.
  • No legend, north arrow, or additional symbols are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Two horse-drawn wagons are positioned on the road, one near the center and one closer to the bottom edge.
  • The road curves gently and is bordered on both sides by thick forest, limiting movement off the path.
  • The "Mangy Pack" label is set off the road, suggesting an encounter or event in the woods.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical movement and encounter planning, with clear grid lines for measuring distance.
  • The placement of the "Mangy Pack" label suggests a likely ambush or event area off the main road.
  • The road's curvature and forest density create natural chokepoints and limited lines of sight, which may influence player tactics. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.020,r=0.458,b=0.457), with ID 7787abb3-cfdc-45a0-8d2a-d630f98cf4f2 -->

Summary : This is a gridded battle map illustration titled "Old Orchard," depicting a top-down view of an orchard with a central dirt path, scattered trees, and a compass rose for orientation. The map is scaled for tabletop roleplaying games, with each square representing 5 feet.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a rectangular area divided into a grid, with each square labeled as 5 feet.
  • A compass rose in the southeast quadrant indicates cardinal directions (N, E, S, W).
  • The map is titled "OLD ORCHARD" in the northwest quadrant.

Keys & Annotations :
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" is noted in the southeast corner.
  • The central feature is a dirt path running north-south through the middle of the map.
  • Scattered trees are depicted on both sides of the path, with more trees on the eastern side.
  • The background is shaded in varying greens to indicate grassy terrain.

Ordering :
  • The path runs vertically, dividing the map into western and eastern halves.
  • Trees are irregularly spaced, with clusters and open areas.
  • The compass rose provides spatial orientation, with north at the top.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical movement and encounters, with the grid facilitating measurement.
  • The central path offers a clear route, while the trees provide cover or obstacles.
  • The denser tree placement on the eastern side may influence movement or line of sight for game scenarios. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.469,t=0.004,r=1.000,b=0.455), with ID f4d54d21-d9d1-4057-8bce-5ee0aad327a2 -->

Summary : This is a color map illustration of a rural homestead labeled "Trin's House," showing a house, outbuilding, paths, and adjacent farmland, overlaid with a square grid for scale.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • Depicts a top-down view of a rural property labeled "TRIN'S HOUSE" in the upper left.
  • The map is overlaid with a square grid; each square represents 5 feet, as indicated by the scale bar in the lower right ("1 SQUARE = 5 FEET").
  • The area includes a house, a smaller outbuilding, a dirt path, and a cultivated field.
  • No compass rose or latitude/longitude; orientation is implied with the path entering from the northwest.

Keys & Annotations :
  • "TRIN'S HOUSE" label in the upper left corner.
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" scale bar in the lower right.
  • No legend or color key, but color is used to distinguish features: green for grass/trees, brown for dirt/fields, red-brown for roofs.

Features & Spatial Relationships :
  • Main house is centrally located, L-shaped, with a red-brown roof and a small porch on the west side.
  • A smaller rectangular outbuilding is to the east of the house, with a visible door and a bench or trough.
  • A wide dirt path runs north-south along the left side, curving toward the house entrance.
  • The lower right quadrant is dominated by a large, rectangular plowed field, bordered by grass and shrubs.
  • Trees and bushes are scattered around the property, especially to the north and east.
  • The house and outbuilding are separated by a grassy yard.

Analysis :
  • The map provides a clear, gridded layout suitable for tactical or role-playing use, with all major features easily distinguishable.
  • The house is positioned for easy access from the main path, with the field conveniently adjacent for farming.
  • The grid allows precise measurement of distances for movement or planning. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.467,r=0.997,b=0.997), with ID f6666ca0-5be0-405c-8572-1e580969d55e -->

as well. This affects additional enemies within 30 feet
of them and uses the caustic wolf’s Intimidation check
with a –4 circumstance penalty. Enemies cannot be
affected by the howl more than once, even if
they are near more than one howling wolf.

temporarily immune for 24 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.126,r=0.449,b=0.234), with ID 8a2fb899-1ae7-4fb6-9001-1ab4acf23214 -->

As they pass through the middle of town,
the wagons go around the ancient
plaguestone, a large, flat, cylindrical
rock standing 2 feet high, with a
hole in its center and a bowl-shaped
depression off to one side. When the
plague ran rampant, the townsfolk left
food for the sick in the bowl, while the
sick left coins in the center hole (which
was filled with vinegar to cleanse the
coinage of contamination). Today,
the stone is nothing more than a
moss-covered relic, although
the villain in this adventure
has deadly plans for it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.158,r=0.821,b=0.387), with ID e2bf70ed-a756-45a7-b39f-dc4803343e6e -->

After the Fight: Bort and Tamli inspect the caravan to make sure everyone is okay. When the wolves charged in, they spooked the horses pulling the wagons. While the teamsters kept them from bolting during the attack, the rear wagon was pulled several feet off the trail into the muck, making it nearly impossible to move. This had no effect on the fight itself, but it does prevent the wagon from moving on. Tamli discovers this problem and calls upon Olf, Ulf, and the PCs to find a solution. To get the wagon moving again, at least two PCs must help, although it will be easier if more assist. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.250,r=0.451,b=0.508), with ID b35ac5b7-0fc7-4d74-b9f2-803d132290ff -->

Everyone helping on this task must attempt a
DC 15 Athletics check. As long as two PCs succeed,
the wagon gets moving again without incident. If
fewer than two succeed, the wagon still gets moving,
but any PC that failed is fatigued by the effort. Anyone
that critically fails the check is fatigued as well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.511,r=0.451,b=0.601), with ID 963616ee-211f-4cb8-95e1-84b3bf0a936b -->

Meanwhile, Bort checks on everyone’s health. Olf and Ulf sustained minor injuries which they play up as much more serious, but everyone seems to be alive and well. Bort sees what the PCs accomplished and thanks them profusely. He offers to buy them dinner in town later as a reward and promises to regale them with tales of his adventures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.602,r=0.451,b=0.709), with ID 3b11cedf-7f11-493e-b432-e6149a8e9311 -->

# ARRIVING IN ETRAN'S FOLLY
After dealing with the wolves and getting the wagon back on track, the caravan is free to continue to Etran’s Folly. The journey takes only an hour, and the wagons roll into town a few hours before dusk. All of the wagons head for the Feedmill, the only inn and tavern in the small community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.719,r=0.451,b=0.831), with ID 9c80d5fd-04f2-4ada-8e0c-81a99478eaa2 -->

Most of the simple wood-and-thatch homes in
Etran’s Folly look identical to one another and are in
a similar state of disrepair. A number of the houses
clearly look abandoned, their roofs collapsed. If the
characters ask about this, anyone in the caravan can
tell them the community suffered heavily from the
plague 20 years ago and has never fully recovered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.833,r=0.451,b=0.939), with ID d71b19e3-226f-4d34-ba80-0db60909924e -->

Upon arrival, the
teamsters secure the caravan
for the night while Bort travels
around town to conduct business
with the crafters and families that call
Etran’s Folly home. This leaves the PCs to explore the
Feedmill and get to know some of the more colorful
members of the community. This would be a good
time to introduce the NPCs described on page 52;
become familiar with them so that you can represent
the townsfolk if the PCs talk to them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.389,r=0.818,b=0.556), with ID cc939f5b-6294-443f-bfd1-700b862826fd -->

Notable Meetings  
The first character that the players are likely to meet is Edra Wythe, the stable hand at the Feedmill. She greets them when the caravan arrives and immediately worries about the condition of the horses. Soon after, the PCs meet Delma and the rest of the staff at the Feedmill. Notably, the goblin Phinick is particularly shy around newcomers, even if one of them is also a goblin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.569,r=0.817,b=0.693), with ID 01f02296-42ac-4f6d-9e7c-c34df2082b34 -->

The first time the characters enter the taproom of
the Feedmill, they find it empty of customers save
for Hallod—a gigantic, brutish human man. Phinick
is serving him food and drink, squeaking whenever
Hallod demands another round. PCs that try to talk
to Hallod find he has little to say aside from offering
curt, insulting replies. Shortly thereafter, he finishes his
meal and leaves. If anyone asks the staff about him,
they say that Hallod is a bit of a bully around town,
but it is simple enough to stay out of his way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.694,r=0.817,b=0.847), with ID 028e2d57-b8a5-49e1-a67c-6443caf0b984 -->

Event 1. Bar Brawl                        Moderate 1
In the early evening, Bort returns to the Feedmill and invites the characters to supper. He has reserved a table upon the dais next to Flonk, the town’s bard, who is tuning his instrument just as the meal is served. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.860,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 29ccd6ca-6880-4d6c-b47c-33a0b5693622 -->

SETTING UP THE MYSTERY
Bort’s poisoning is a mystery central to this adventure, and for everything to go as planned, you should ensure a certain amount of chaos and confusion in the moments leading up to his death. The bar fight, no matter how short, is a distraction that ensures the PCs lose track of the various suspects. It’s particularly important who is present and who goes missing during the fight and its aftermath.
  Present for Dinner: Feedmill staff (Amora, Delma, Kolnral, Phinick, Trin), town locals (Farmer Eallom, Flonk the Bard, Sir Lawren, 14 local farmers), caravan members (Bort, Olf, Ulf), the player characters.
    Leaves During the Fight: Delma, Sir Lawren, Phinick, Trin.
    Arrives After the Fight: Rolth Garley, Tamli; Delma returns with Rolth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.101,r=0.524,b=0.419), with ID f945650c-7dea-41fd-ad63-e116204e6ab4 -->

The rest of the Feedmill is full of local farmers, as well as a few notable characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.431,r=0.526,b=0.464), with ID 0154adb0-79aa-48ec-9b80-c88da7fb003c -->

Kolnral and Trin are serving the guests tonight,
while Delma tends bar and Amora is busy in the
kitchen. Phinick can be seen doing odd jobs all over,
but once dinner begins, he spends most of his time
helping Amora in the kitchen. By the time dinner
starts, Sir Lawren is deep into his cups, leaning back
dangerously in his chair, while Farmer Eallom is busy
gambling and getting drunk with Olf and Ulf. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.464,r=0.526,b=0.586), with ID a6e1e4cd-86f4-42f0-884c-43fe4f641c2e -->

As the first dishes come out (wild game and roasted turnips with a side of burnt seed cake, coupled with watery turnip ale), Bort is busy asking the PCs where they are from and where they are going, and telling some of his fabulous tales (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar on page 54). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.587,r=0.525,b=0.678), with ID 8f52a98a-7480-474e-b0cc-4cdc730553f1 -->

**Creature:** Toward the end of the meal, just as a dessert of warm turnip porridge is being served, Kolnral accidentally bumps into Farmer Eallom as he is sitting down with another ale, causing the farmer to spill all over himself. Eallom stands up and starts yelling at poor Kolnral. Seconds later, Eallom begins throwing punches and knocking over tables, and a bar fight erupts in the common area of the tavern. For this encounter, you might want to refresh yourself on the rules for nonlethal attacks on page 453 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.679,r=0.525,b=0.847), with ID e6bc40cb-f13e-4250-bee2-66e36eab50dd -->

During the fight, the entire common area of the Feedmill turns to chaos as a dozen drunken farmers wind up in a gigantic brawl. Treat the entire common room as difficult terrain, as it is filled with patrons, knocked over chairs, and other debris. How the players decide to get involved is up to them. The farmers mostly fight with fists, but the occasional chair or mug is thrown as well. If the characters can pacify at least three drunk farmers, the fight ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.310,r=0.893,b=0.448), with ID 38e38e0f-03b9-4288-b992-71d9d6c30e9e -->

Several things happen during the fight, which will
be important later. Sir Lawren slips out the front
door while Phinick runs out the back through the
stables. Delma leaves immediately to fetch the sheriff.
Bort, meanwhile, tries to calm things down, but gets
a chair thrown at him for his trouble. Trin gets hit
with a mug in the first moments of the fight and flees
through the stables to find her brother. Meanwhile,
the taproom turns to chaos. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.449,r=0.892,b=0.585), with ID 5f87a356-6ce5-4096-836b-42434d7a1b7d -->

One minute later (10 combat rounds), or as soon as the PCs bring the fight to an end, Delma returns with Rolth Garley, the town’s sheriff, who takes all the offending farmers to a table in the corner for a stern talking to (this is about all the offense warrants and, besides, the town has no jail). If anyone was dealt lethal wounds during the fight, they pull through thanks to Delma’s skill at Medicine, although the sheriff has strong words for anyone who resorted to such tactics on mostly helpless farm folk. If the characters try to help after the fight is over, Rolth half-heartedly thanks them for their assistance, but dismissively tells them that their help is no longer needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.587,r=0.892,b=0.801), with ID 79c3178a-2cce-4d01-82a4-80abba5ae6e4 -->

A Meal to Die For
After the brawl, Bort invites the characters back to the table to finish their meal and enjoy a round of drinks. Dessert was served before the fight began, and Bort proclaims to all that the turnip porridge here is his favorite, which explains the extra large bowl of it sitting before him. In fact, his bowl is unique in more ways than one—it's also poisoned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.813,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID be8feca4-3bfc-445e-b0f9-446a97d17ad3 -->

Poisoned Dessert: Just a few minutes into his dessert, Bort begins to cough and choke. Playing this off as a bit of indigestion, he continues whatever tale he was in the middle of telling. A few moments later it is clear, as the coughing returns, that he is in distress. He begins to turn purple and his mouth begins frothing. Seconds after, his eyes roll into his head and a rumble can be heard in his guts. Mere moments thereafter, he collapses onto the table and dies. The characters might attempt to aid him using Medicine. A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Medicine check determines that Bort is not choking on anything, but that his windpipe has swollen shut, indicating that he has been poisoned. Allow an extra Medicine check to use Treat Poison (against the virulent poison’s DC of 24) to help Bort attempt his Fortitude save to resist, but the amount put in his porridge is just too great, and even if his throat is somehow opened so he can breathe, he still fails every save against the poison and dies (22 Hit Points, Fortitude Save +6). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.454,b=0.433), with ID 0c67b1b1-cb5f-4100-b12e-5deee861d683 -->

Fortunately for the PCs, should any of them
accidentally ingest some of the poison, only trace
amounts remain in the bowl. Treat any trace ingestion
as the poison outlined below, but the maximum
duration is only 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.434,r=0.453,b=0.510), with ID abfc4150-ae8a-4281-b3d4-e504849915f8 -->

Bort’s death happens so quickly that no one in the Feedmill has a chance to react. After Bort collapses, townsfolk gather round to see what all the commotion is about. A few rounds later, Delma and Rolth make their way to the table to see what is happening. As they witness the PCs trying to help, it’s clear the PCs were not responsible, but at first, everyone is just concerned for the dwarf’s well-being. Once it’s clear he is dead, the tavern goes silent, and everyone begins eyeing one another (and their food). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.663,r=0.452,b=0.816), with ID c452d8b3-0f0b-4fb7-b6c8-5c18374809ff -->

Rolth’s Investigation  
As the town’s only real member of law enforcement, Rolth Garley is incompetent. He is the mayor’s nephew and rarely does anything other than settle disputes over livestock and break up the occasional drunken brawl. In fact, the town has not had a crime reported in years, so when Bort dies, Rolth realizes he’s in over his head. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.829,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID a1d7a581-b9f0-4a71-b803-ee7ee0216a59 -->

The sheriff’s first inclination is to
cover the body, take everyone at the
table and all the members of the caravan out
to the stables, and talk to each person in
turn about what happened. Although he is
privately hoping someone will give him a clue,
he is honestly just hoping to gain a better idea of
what happened. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.126,r=0.815,b=0.249), with ID 8cfbb2d0-726c-4007-8b27-951237f7aeb8 -->

Though he can’t be certain, hearing that the PCs tried to help the Bort, combined with the fact that they hardly knew him, convinces the sheriff that they are unlikely to be responsible. The members of the caravan who would inherit the lucrative business are high on the list of suspects, but most were not in the bar, and those that were—Olf and Ulf—have solid alibis: they were drinking and gambling with Eallom before and after the fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.250,r=0.818,b=0.387), with ID 0288f678-9e6d-48bc-8ca0-7957de328199 -->

Feel free to modify this interrogation according to
the actions of the players. Rolth grants requests that
are likely to further the investigation, but he will not
start questioning other townsfolk until he has first
interrogated the PCs and other caravan members. He
is not willing to hold everyone in the bar; he’s certain
they won’t be leaving town anytime soon. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.388,r=0.818,b=0.494), with ID 589bd761-3c29-4a6a-9b74-3a549d858a01 -->

In the meantime, Delma closes the kitchen and
sends most of the other townsfolk home, including
her staff (although Trin and Phinick are already gone). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.495,r=0.816,b=0.540), with ID 49605089-c358-42d4-b432-3d9372bd5d1c -->

Upon finishing his questioning, Rolth realizes that there is no clear suspect, and that no member of the caravan can be ruled out. As the town has no jail, he informs everyone he will need to turn this investigation over to a circuit judge who visits the town occasionally to deal with serious legal matters and crimes. Unfortunately, the judge, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, is not due back for another month, so everyone is stuck here until then. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.541,r=0.817,b=0.677), with ID 70fe3ec6-e525-4814-8848-dbed2ebc5fe9 -->

If the PCs protest, Rolth insists that unless he
knows who committed this heinous crime, he is
bound to hold all possible suspects until the judge
arrives. He does add that if the characters assist in
the investigation, it might be resolved sooner. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.679,r=0.818,b=0.755), with ID cde814f2-41e1-4568-a6ad-2df7f626c220 -->

TRACKING DOWN THE KILLER  
After Rolth orders the caravan to remain in town, everyone heads home. Bort’s body is taken down to the cellar to be kept cool, while Tamli and the rest of the caravan gathers to mourn. She invites the characters to join them out near the wagons. This is a somber occasion, and everyone in the company is at a loss. Bort was their leader, and without him, their future is uncertain. Tales of remembrance are told through teary eyes, and rare bottles of elven wine from Kyonin are passed around for all to share. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.765,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 462432b9-caff-49a6-976a-6a22f7808f23 -->

Tamli remains mostly quiet through this, but speaks
up at the end of the night, just as the sun begins to rise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.160), with ID df532d03-38a4-4428-bdd2-15050d661037 -->

“Bort was more than just a merchant, more than just the boss. He was my friend. We won’t leave here until we’ve found out who did this. Rolth’s a fool, but I’d be an even greater fool if I thought I could get to the bottom of this. Fixing wagons and moving goods, that’s my job. But you,” she says, pointing at all of you, “you might be able to figure out who killed Bort and get justice for him.” She holds back tears as she says, “For all of us. Will you help uncover who did this?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.171,r=0.525,b=0.311), with ID fa0f9d78-3101-4637-bfb8-20038609305b -->

Assuming that the characters agree, they can investigate Bort’s murder in several ways. They can search the Feedmill for clues, they can go through Bort’s ledgers, and they can talk to various witnesses and suspects around town. Each of these approaches is described below. Although there is plenty of time before the circuit judge arrives, Tamli and the other caravan members instill a sense of urgency. No one wants to remain in this town an hour longer than they have to. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.326,r=0.524,b=0.464), with ID 906e4c0c-4c91-4638-8aa5-64dc95b88be7 -->

Searching the Feedmill  
One of the obvious places to start the investigation is the Feedmill itself. After the events of the previous night, the common room was tidied up a bit, but the kitchen is in complete disarray. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.476,r=0.524,b=0.555), with ID b105a9aa-3831-4a7e-96c2-360de0b9c072 -->

**Dining Room:** There is little to be found here that relates to Bort’s death. The poisoned bowl was taken to the kitchen, and there is nothing remarkable about the table or chair where Bort perished. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.556,r=0.523,b=0.617), with ID 76e72cb8-5248-4201-95c6-5752152d18a2 -->

Kitchen: The kitchen contains the cooking utensils needed to operate the Feedmill—kettles, skillets, knives, a mortar and pestle, roasting spits, a sieve, and a butter churner. Of particular note is the kettle of turnip porridge sitting on the counter, next to Bort’s large bowl. Although the remnants are starting to dry out, a PC who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check notices an unusual, faintly floral, smell in the porridge remaining in Bort’s bowl. Checking all the herbs in the kitchen doesn’t uncover a match, nor is the smell similar to that of ground clove and anise in the mortar and pestle that was used to spice the dishes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.618,r=0.523,b=0.800), with ID 9550d25d-c492-42c4-8333-ff8b93dda7b5 -->

**Cellar:** Down in the cellar, alongside a number of large casks of ale and a few old, dusty bottles of wine, is the body of Bort Bargith. His flesh has turned an odd blue color in death, and anyone checking gets the faintest impression of a floral odor from the body. There is nothing else here to be learned that could not be uncovered when he was dying. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.802,r=0.523,b=0.907), with ID 49314ca1-5611-447c-b36b-35bb78e13cab -->

**The Grounds:** There is not much to be gained searching the grounds. There is no sign that anyone <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.183,t=0.909,r=0.524,b=0.939), with ID 96038827-164c-4850-a12a-1c5f0f383a40 -->

unexpected was present. Searching the yard outside the
barn does reveal one very important clue: a PC who
succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check spots a glint
in the grass just outside the stable doors, leading to a
small glass vial with a simple cork. The vial is empty
but contains traces of a floral-smelling liquid. This is
the vial that Phinick used to season Bort’s porridge, and
he dropped it here when he fled during the bar brawl. If
the PCs do not uncover this, Edra finds it two days later
and gives it to them, hoping to assist their investigation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.128,r=0.891,b=0.280), with ID a9a2093a-d9b7-4512-ac5a-2ddfdb742f44 -->

### BORT’S BOOKS
The players might think to check through Bort’s belongings and papers for clues as to why someone might want to murder him. Tamli has the keys to Bort’s wagon and will let the PCs inside, but she will not tolerate them ransacking the place. She remains very protective of Bort’s memory and reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.293,r=0.891,b=0.401), with ID 1858db98-295c-4014-b4f1-631f555aeb4b -->

Inside, Bort’s wagon is filled with knickknacks and
keepsakes from his journeys. His belongings are truly
a bewildering assortment of odds and ends, including
a bottle with a tiny skull floating in oil, a taxidermic
dragon whelp, a mummified owlbear paw, a shining
crystal that holds the illusionary image of a mountain
peak inside, and so on. There are a number of minor
magic trinkets in here, but Tamli will not allow the
players to take or examine these at all. The merchant’s
ledgers are easily found in a rack above his bed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.404,r=0.890,b=0.554), with ID 80dcd224-ef79-4f4f-ae6c-bf5bc2545c6e -->

The books are large and filled to the brim with details about his travels and transactions over many years. Acquiring any useful information from them takes at least 4 hours and requires a successful DC 18 Decipher Writing check (using Society or a related Lore skill). A PC who succeeds at this check uncovers that Bort visited Etran’s Folly at least 22 times in the past decade, and about five years ago the merchant started making deliveries labeled “reagents” to someone referred to only as “H,” receiving rather large sums of gold in exchange. These deliveries are numbered, starting with 1 and ending with delivery number 14, which occurred the day the caravan arrived in town. If the PCs fail to decipher the ledger, they can try again until they find what they are looking for. Each attempt takes 4 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.557,r=0.890,b=0.799), with ID 476c6c14-6173-480f-88a1-e55bde15779e -->

**XP Award:** If the PCs uncover the deliveries made to the mysterious “H,” award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.801,r=0.889,b=0.831), with ID 0bda60bd-a514-40e3-a813-fdb9b80b7aca -->

Questioning Amora                Trivial 1
After Bort’s death, Amora tells Delma that the kitchen should be closed immediately, just in case it was the food. Proud of her work, the cook insists Bort’s death must be foul play because, she explains, simple food poisoning doesn’t work that fast and isn’t as deadly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.845,r=0.890,b=0.939), with ID e7c761dd-b241-4f63-8682-3aa36f286315 -->

Delma agrees, but insists that nothing in the kitchen  
be cleaned or removed, so that investigators can look  
for clues and clear Amora’s good name.  
Removing her apron, Amora heads  
home and does not return for as long  
as the investigation continues. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.125,r=0.457,b=0.220), with ID 2bafccd4-cf85-4883-ab6d-771c85d02acf -->

armor—to protect her from the bees—
armed with a smoke can to pacify any
bees that remain. She invites the PCs to
her home, offering up remedies for any
stings they might have suffered. She
also serves delicious biscuits with
honey harvested from the beehive.

When talk turns to Bort’s murder,
Amora says that she prepared the
dessert, Phinick plated it and Trin
served it. She doesn’t think anyone else
was in the kitchen, even though she went
out more than once to empty the slop
bucket. Amora is terribly worried about her
image, and she seems to care more about
her reputation around town than
about the dead dwarf. If taken
back to the kitchen, she confirms
that nothing there seems out of the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.437,t=0.128,r=0.823,b=0.415), with ID b255c06b-6821-4c61-9efc-808786623bb4 -->

B. THE OLD ORCHARD  
If the characters go looking for Amora, townsfolk can tell them she lives in the Old Orchard, an area just outside town that was once a productive apple orchard. These days, it is foul and rotten, the trees having taken on a sickness. After the trees went bad a few years back, the grove’s tender moved with his family to Almas, and Amora lives in the small shack they left behind. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.229,r=0.393,b=0.418), with ID 65501593-6650-4af9-bcc3-43f79e5f3294 -->

Creatures: Unless care is taken to travel around the outside of the orchard, the PCs are likely to pass near a tree containing a gigantic beehive. The bees do not take well to intruders, and if anyone comes within 30 feet, the bees swarm and attack. Although they can be defeated conventionally, any player who asks can use an action to attempt a DC 12 Nature check; if successful, the PC knows that bees are pacified by smoke. If anyone uses a smokestick or similar item against the bee swarm, the swarm dissipates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.419,r=0.455,b=0.587), with ID 612a2600-6fff-47d9-bfac-c79deda8f8e1 -->

Questioning Delma  
As the owner of the Feedmill, Delma knows much about its operations and the staff that work there, but her knowledge of the evening of the poisoning is limited to what she saw in the taproom, which isn’t much. She knows where every one of her staff lives, except for Phinick; she knows only that he sleeps in the barn sometimes. She is steadfast in her conviction that no one in her employ had any ill will toward Bort, and the thought of any of them randomly poisoning the dwarf is absurd. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.479,r=0.818,b=0.644), with ID b54cb14f-f89a-41c0-b906-716725f87806 -->

The day after the murder, probably after they have
finished up a day investigating, Delma seeks out the
PCs to talk to them about their bill. She is happy
for them to stay at the Feedmill, but they will have to
pay for room and board. While this is not costly
(only about 5 sp per day), she offers them a greatly
reduced rate of only 2 sp per day if they assist her
with a few chores around the shop and town. In
particular, she would like some help with her aging
father Targen, the mayor of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.649,r=0.818,b=0.801), with ID b05221b8-04f2-4e91-8bd9-46e4a47f7158 -->

Event 2. Tour of Etran’s Folly  
For years now, octogenarian Targen Fulst has been unable to walk for more than a few feet under his own power. His eyesight failing, he spends most of his days in a wooden wheelchair made from a modified pushcart.

Assuming the characters agree, Targe takes them to visit the following sites around town, talking to them all the while about the town’s history and its people. The path starts at the Feedmill and visits the following locations in order. Targen knows a great deal of common information about these sites (as described on page 51) and any town history surrounding them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.158,r=0.489,b=0.325), with ID f21acd3f-d5b4-4da4-bfb5-bbf878fed87c -->

The Feedmill: Targen is proud to talk about the Feedmill, the town’s only major business. Targen opened the Feedmill more than 50 years ago, before the Goblinblood Wars. His brother died in that conflict, along with much of Targen’s extended family. The town itself avoided the worst of the conflict, which occurred primarily to the west. If there are any goblins in the party, Targen gives them a wary glance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.326,r=0.530,b=0.495), with ID 071ea437-eeec-4c9d-9f0c-c8055e774fe1 -->

**Plaguestone:** The path next leads to the plaguestone, which was used to give food and aid to those suffering from the plague. Targen can tell the PCs much about the plague that came to Etran’s Folly. He recounts how everyone suspected a local witch named Silwyth of starting the plague (she was actually an alchemist, but Targen has no idea what that is), and after Silwyth caught it herself, she cursed the town’s only priest before she died. Soon after, Father Bolgrist contracted the plague and died. Targen tells the PCs that the witch had a daughter named Vilree who stuck around her mother’s home for a few years, then probably died or ran off. Targen does not bother to recount the fact that Silwyth tried to stop the plague, or that Father Bolgrist was the first to accuse Silwyth of spreading it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.495,r=0.525,b=0.724), with ID 92666470-9752-4bed-82ac-f2afa16a7c07 -->

**Dead Homes:** After visiting the plaguestone, Targen guides the PCs through the north side of town where most of the plague victims lived. Most of their homes are empty and in a terrible state of disrepair. Only the very poor or desperate call this part of town home. Targen notes that anyone with coin lives on the south side of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.725,r=0.524,b=0.832), with ID 7d4b7160-0e23-49f3-acee-09b0c6d9ce5d -->

**Drunk Shepherd’s Path:** Leaving the north side of town, Targen wants to be walked along this old shepherd’s path that wanders through the turnip farms around town. He mentions that they were once sheep pastures, but the last large flock left town years ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.832,r=0.523,b=0.908), with ID 171c492a-42df-4a4a-8066-414f0a1a2cce -->

Targen Fulst

Targen notes as the group wanders through the old woods that while the shrine is currently dedicated to Gozreh, it has served other purposes. He claims that druids used to gather at the shrine long ago. Since Father Bolgrist’s death, nobody worships here anymore. Unfortunately, the area is overrun by wilderness, and the shrine is home to a group of hungry bloodseekers (see Creatures in area C below).

Etran’s Hill: On the way back home, the path leads past Etran’s Hill. Looming to the town’s southeast, this hill was the site of the first home built in the area. Targen notes that Etran spent his fortune founding the town, only to die in a fire that consumed him and his family because the house was too far away from the well and the river. This is how Etran’s Folly got its name. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.459,t=0.128,r=0.894,b=0.464), with ID 97ade179-85f8-407f-9093-7d751a06f595 -->

**Back Home:** The path leads back to the Feedmill. Targen nods off and naps for the last leg of the journey, and upon arriving home, he complains that it took too long and he is late for lunch.

Questioning Edra  
Edra is easy to find, as she lives at the Feedmill and is always around, taking care of the animals and making sure the stables are in good condition. On the night of the poisoning, Edra was busy in the stables with Glunda, tending to Bort’s horses; Glunda can confirm this. When the fight broke out, she saw Phinick flee right away, and she saw Trin leave through the stable doors soon after, clutching a wound on her cheek. She was nowhere near the food or the poisoning. Edra knows that Phinick sometimes <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.769,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID 86072bf2-4dd6-4e5f-a403-978cc0483c1b -->

Two days after the murder, unless the PCs

The day after the poisoning, Edra asks the

Summary : This is an illustration of a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat with a cord, depicted in a stylized, possibly hand-drawn manner, likely for a tabletop roleplaying game or adventure module.

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • Main subject is a person shown from the shoulders up, wearing a tan or beige wide-brimmed hat with a brown band and a cord or strap.
  • The illustration is stylized, with clear outlines and shading, and the person is facing to the right.
  • The background is white, and the image is cropped to focus on the head and hat.
  • There is a green nameplate or label at the bottom edge, partially visible, with the text "Emera Fallen" (the rest is cut off).

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators.
  • The image appears to be digital or hand-drawn art, not a photograph.
  • The hat has a woven texture and a prominent brim, suggesting an explorer or adventurer theme.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The hat dominates the upper portion of the image, with the head and neck below.
  • The cord or strap is draped over the brim and hangs down.

Analysis : 
  • The illustration conveys an adventurous or outdoorsy character, likely intended to represent a non-player character (NPC) or player character in a roleplaying game context. The hat and cord suggest preparedness for outdoor exploration. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.495,r=0.564,b=0.802), with ID 63218aa9-278b-4b2b-842f-f3b717a077ca -->

Questioning Farmer Eallom
Farmer Eallom can be found in his fields most days and in the taproom of the Feedmill most nights. He is in a foul mood each morning as he recovers from the excess of the past evening. He is less hostile to visitors in the afternoons, but even on the best of days the farmer is not friendly. His farm is on the north side of town and is easily mistaken for being abandoned, as it isn’t in good repair.

Eallom’s memory of the night of the murder (as with most any night) is a bit hazy. He remembers getting into a fight with “that clumsy fool Kolnral,” and he recalls talking to Rolth, but he has little to say about Bort. He was gambling and drinking with Olf and Ulf before and after the fight, and he is still quite bitter about the amount of coin they won from him that night. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.417,t=0.127,r=0.804,b=0.405), with ID 5b479866-56e0-41bb-bb9c-b79a0665a486 -->

## QUESTIONING FLONK
Flonk can be found around town during the afternoon and in the tavern at night. In either case, he is busy performing—badly. The bard has little to offer the characters. Before the brawl, he was both drinking and performing, and any information he offers is likely to conflict with other accounts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.416,r=0.802,b=0.539), with ID f1cdf32e-6d0e-4c23-908d-7ae370848e14 -->

Questioning Kolnral  
Kolnral lives not far from the Feedmill with his wife and newborn daughter. After the poisoning, he can be found at home, recovering from the injuries suffered during the bar brawl. He is happy to talk to the PCs about the night of Bort’s poisoning. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.560,t=0.554,r=0.799,b=0.677), with ID 50d3dad1-f579-4c17-843d-6b11e0a13322 -->

Eallom

Kolnral confirms that he served drinks while Trin served the food. He also can confirm that Amora was busy in the kitchen while Phinick assisted around the bar and kitchen. Most of his interactions that night were with Delma, as she prepared drinks for him to serve to thirsty guests. The last thing he clearly recalls is accidentally bumping into Eallom, which caused the farmer to spill his drink and start the brawl. When Kolnral was knocked to the floor, he saw Phinick fleeing the bar, but the rest is a blur. He regained his senses shortly after Bort’s death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.465,t=0.678,r=0.799,b=0.894), with ID d5245511-6ee4-49a7-aa2b-046ba5c82f5d -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated table of contents for an adventure module, featuring a fantasy-themed border and listing the main sections of the adventure.

illustration:
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a vertical, scroll-like panel bordered by purple, organic, magical-looking tendrils and adorned with fantasy elements such as a glowing potion bottle, a flower, and sparkles.
  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and golds, with glowing highlights.
  • The composition is vertical, with the text centered within the scroll and decorative elements framing the top and bottom.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The only on-image text is the table of contents, listing:
    – Part 1: A Mysterious Murder
    – Part 2: The Ranger’s Request
    – Part 3: Into Vilree’s Lair
    – Adventure Toolbox

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The decorative elements frame the scroll, with the potion bottle and flower at the top, and a vial and sparkles at the bottom.
  • The text is vertically aligned and evenly spaced within the scroll.

Analysis : 
  • The illustration is designed to evoke a magical, mysterious atmosphere appropriate for a fantasy adventure. The decorative border and glowing elements draw attention to the table of contents, making it visually engaging and thematic. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.798,t=0.090,r=0.998,b=0.761), with ID a65ea22d-db5a-4537-a17c-e38d679fbe60 -->

after an entire day missing, Delma and the others
at the Feedmill note his absence as being unusual. If the
PCs ask others why he left during the brawl, they learn
that he frequently flees the tavern during fights because
he is often the target of a thrown mug or, worse still,
someone picks him up and throws him at someone else. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.127,r=0.524,b=0.218), with ID 6f4165a3-7c70-449f-b1fb-6488df889bb3 -->

The truth is that Phinick fled from the brawl, but he
soon learned of Bort’s death and became afraid that
the spice he was bullied into putting into the porridge
was poison. The goblin fears he’s responsible for the
dwarf’s murder and is terrified of what the townsfolk
might do to him if they find out. The fact that he
was forced to add the spice, and that he had no idea
what it actually was, does little to ease his concern,
so he spent several days in hiding just trying to figure
out what to do. Finding Phinick is not an easy task.
No one seems to know where the goblin stays, and
searching every building would take a week or more. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.219,r=0.524,b=0.402), with ID 9b1906b5-a6bb-48a7-9023-af73d5359517 -->

Phinick hides in a small shack in the woods and in one of the abandoned homes on the north side of town, and does not come out of hiding until two days have passed, when his food supplies have run low. He has no intention of talking to anyone, and he hopes to sneak back to the Feedmill, get some food, and continue hiding until this whole mess is a distant memory. The PCs run across him as he is making his way between houses on his way to the Feedmill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.403,r=0.523,b=0.540), with ID 7a42b4b9-8d61-4812-8e52-bf1da2534748 -->

Chasing Phinick                Severe 1
Once spotted, Phinick assumes he’s being blamed for Bort’s death and runs off to avoid the PCs. To keep things simple, the PCs each take turns attempting to pass each location, in order. On a PC’s turn, they must attempt one of the listed checks for each location or give up the chase. Each success earns the PC 1 point toward catching Phinick, while a critical success awards 2. If a PC fails a check, they suffer the listed drawback (if any). Either way, the PCs move on to the next location. A PC who accumulates 4 points catches Phinick at that location, and if no PC gains 4 points after attempting checks at all five locations, Phinick escapes. Turns don’t correspond to time; a PC with more points reaches new locations before a PC with fewer points, but once the chase is over, the rest of the PCs catch up. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.552,r=0.524,b=0.800), with ID 70693142-9c3a-4e7c-ad67-1cf9babb9641 -->

If the PCs fail to catch Phinick before he crosses the turnip field, he leaps across the stream and disappears into the woods around town and does not resurface for at least a day. This might lead to another chase or an ambush if the PCs are ready for him, at your discretion. If the PCs fail again, Delma apprehends Phinick when he is caught sneaking food from the larder in the Feedmill. In any case, once the unfortunate goblin is captured, the PCs can question him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.250,r=0.890,b=0.387), with ID d6797601-4b36-4ec1-9b35-1ad4c7f8f93a -->

Phinick’s Tale  
The PCs intimidate Phinick with their sheer presence, and he is terrified of being blamed for Bort’s death. As a result, he goes to extremes to ingratiate himself with the PCs once he is caught. Although he does not at first mention Bort or the poisoning, if the PCs question him about it and succeed at a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidation check, his facade completely cracks and he begins blubbering, begging the characters for mercy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.401,r=0.891,b=0.554), with ID ce47e297-8caf-4611-94e5-cdcc9afbfd9a -->

Phinick explains that shortly after Bort arrived in
town, Hallod, the town bully, cornered the goblin.
Hallod gave him a vial of “spices” and told Phinick
that if he did not put them in Bort’s food, he would
find himself facing the sharp point of one of Hallod’s
many knives. The bully told Phinick that the spices
would only make Bort sick: a little payback for a
bad deal he made with the merchant the last time he
was in town. Not wanting to face a severe beating,
Phinick agreed and slipped the contents of the vial
into Bort’s porridge just before the fight broke out. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.557,r=0.890,b=0.722), with ID b800fe34-b81f-4c32-96db-1bd523c7d4e9 -->

Shortly thereafter, Phinick fled the bar, only to learn
the next morning that Bort had died from his poisoned
dessert. Terrified, Phinick has been hiding ever since.
He realizes he’s involved, but he begs the characters
for mercy, claiming honestly that he had no idea the
vial was filled with deadly poison. If the players bring
Rolth Garley into this, the sheriff takes the goblin into
custody, locking him up in the cellar of his house until
the circuit judge arrives. After hearing the goblin’s story,
Rolth says that it would go much easier for Phinick if
Hallod were in custody as well. Rolth is afraid of the
massive man, and refuses to take on the bully himself,
asking the PCs to do it instead. Rolth is firm in his belief

Questioning Sir Lawren Krent

Sir Lawren Krent can be found most days sleeping in an abandoned home or a drainage ditch. He smells quite bad by morning, but most days, he dumps a bucket of water or two over himself to preserve what shreds of dignity he has left. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.337,r=0.392,b=0.479), with ID 674ab27b-b2b3-42dd-9f04-1a840c5df1ce -->

Sir Lawren is not much help to the PCs’
investigation. He fled the moment the bar brawl
began, and he was very drunk before it had even
started. The former knight is terrified of conflict, and
he is constantly looking over his shoulder as if he is
being followed. See the side quest section on page 59
for more information on what is haunting Sir Lawren. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.479,r=0.453,b=0.587), with ID 43be5f6b-5d92-4f02-be68-aa297adbe54a -->

**QUESTIONING TRIN**  
Trin works four nights a week at the Feedmill while her brother Marny stays home to work the crops, despite the fact that the soil seems to have turned sour. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.598,r=0.452,b=0.664), with ID 751ff9a4-91aa-41b6-9f33-3a2f6c8be647 -->

E. TRIN’S HOUSE                                    Low 1
Trin and Marny live on a small turnip farm on the southwest side of town. Although the farm has been struggling this year, the siblings get by on their combined income. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.675,r=0.451,b=0.754), with ID 7bf71a01-8f77-49ba-be26-be6c7df8e9a6 -->

**Creature:** When the PCs arrive at the farm, a PC who succeeds at a DC 10 Perception check notices Marny running clockwise around the farmhouse. The PCs have enough time for a single action, such as drawing a weapon or moving. A moment later, a gigantic boar rounds the farmhouse, chasing the poor man. If the PCs jump into action, they can roll initiative as normal. If they stay back, the pig chases Marny for a minute, catches up to him, wounds him terribly, and flees into the woods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.756,r=0.452,b=0.893), with ID a26c0e8d-72c7-4836-8359-bc0aeb7cdc4a -->

Trin’s Testimony: Marny thanks any PCs that fought the boar or tended his wounds. If the PCs defeated the angry beast, the farmer gratefully offers to dress and cook the animal for them. Trin recognizes the group from the Feedmill and invites them inside for tea. A bruise is visible on her face. Until they inform her, Trin has no idea that Bort is dead, having left the bar after being hit in the face with a mug. She is shocked by the news of the merchant’s death and gladly helps by relating everything she can remember. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.174,r=0.821,b=0.401), with ID d8bcacb3-5311-4124-9f72-8d3a48a409c0 -->

Trin spent the evening serving food while Kolnral served drinks. As a result, she spent most of her night going back and forth between the kitchen and tables. She recalls serving all of the food at the PCs’ table, including the turnip porridge right before the fight began. During the struggle, she stood near the table, having just dropped off the desserts, and that’s when she was hit with the mug. Her memory after that is a blur until she got home, when her brother took care of her. She does not recall seeing anyone near the food who should not have been; she confirms that Amora prepared it and Phinick plated it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.404,r=0.818,b=0.602), with ID cca1795f-0906-45d6-9b7b-80abcbaaf20d -->

HALLOD’S HIDEOUT  
Eventually the characters should try to find Hallod at Dead Willow. Located on the north side of town, the building is easy to find—it earned its name from a large dying tree in the front yard—and it’s in very poor condition.

A huge, dead willow stands in front of a house that appears to be in serious disrepair. It might have had a second story at one time, but that long ago collapsed into ruin, taking parts of the first floor with it. The windows are all boarded over, and the front door hangs open about a foot, kept from swinging wider by a frayed rope. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.739,r=0.818,b=0.846), with ID ff1c49f6-b56a-4f04-9c0c-d50e0d5052a6 -->

Summary : This is a detailed battle map for a tabletop roleplaying game, depicting "Hallod's Hideout" at a location called "Dead Willow." The map shows both an above-ground ruined house and an underground hideout, with labeled areas for navigation and encounter planning.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a small area of terrain, including a ruined house, surrounding grounds, and an underground complex.
  • A square grid overlays the entire map, aiding movement and spatial measurement.
  • The map is oriented with north at the top (standard orientation, no explicit north arrow).
  • The above-ground area is grassy with a path, a dead tree, and a pond; the underground area is shown as stone chambers beneath the surface.

Keys & Annotations :
  • Labeled areas: F1 (dead tree), F2 (house entrance), F3 (back room), F4 (main ruined room), F5 (underground storage/room), F6 (underground main chamber).
  • Text labels: "HALLOD'S HIDEOUT" and "DEAD WILLOW" in the upper left.
  • Distinct visual cues for terrain: green for grass, brown for dirt, black/gray for stone, blue for water.
  • Furniture, debris, crates, and other objects are illustrated in each room for tactical detail.

Ordering :
  • The map is organized with the above-ground area at the top and the underground hideout at the bottom, connected by a path and implied access points.
  • The labeled areas (F1–F6) suggest a sequence for exploration or encounters, starting outside and moving inward and downward.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical encounters, with clear separation between above-ground and underground areas.
  • The grid and labeled points facilitate navigation, encounter setup, and spatial reasoning for players and game masters.
  • The presence of debris, furniture, and environmental features provides opportunities for cover, obstacles, and interactive elements during gameplay.
  • The layout supports a linear or branching exploration path, with multiple rooms and potential points of interest. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.014,t=0.010,r=0.669,b=0.968), with ID 594a9638-ca7e-429b-9d32-7e1d0939fe64 -->

from the roof. There is danger here: Hallod has placed
more than one trap to harm uninvited guests. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.127,r=0.450,b=0.156), with ID 4df22d46-7c46-4250-b649-09e250eea068 -->

Deep beneath the crumbling house is a small
basement area connected to a series of caves that
eventually emerge under the roots of a giant old
tree in the forest outside town. Hallod discovered
this secret exit years ago when he first explored
the house, and he now uses it as a hideout to serve
Vilree’s interests in Etran’s Folly. He has also used
it to smuggle alchemical reagents out of town, and
to move more sinister cargo in. It is the existence of
these caves that has made Hallod such a valuable
minion to Vilree, and no one but Hallod and a few of
Vilree’s other subordinates know about them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.157,r=0.452,b=0.340), with ID 356c7573-758f-4b61-b4a8-c297b72c23b8 -->

Hallod is here, laying low until the events
surrounding Bort’s death blow over. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.342,r=0.451,b=0.372), with ID 2115798e-daaf-456e-b79a-7f10d7aa8091 -->

F1. The Yard  
The yard around the house is choked with weeds and debris from the collapsed house. The area around the willow tree is all but impassible, as the dead branches and leaves have made a large heap around its trunk. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check reveals that someone frequents the property; their trail leads up to the front door, circles the house, and leads down to the stream. A critical success on this check uncovers that the trail never actually goes in through the poorly latched front door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.384,r=0.452,b=0.556), with ID a254ab9f-e288-4f11-b173-09410bf78769 -->

F2. FRONT DOOR  
The front door to the house no longer sits properly in its frame and is kept from swinging wide open by a simple rope attached to the inside latch. Even with this, it still hangs open about a foot. All of this is a ruse, as this entrance is trapped. (Hallod never goes in using the front door, instead using a window in the back.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.568,r=0.451,b=0.692), with ID f7c08b40-62ed-4664-aae3-076a90c2df6c -->

Hazard: The taut rope holding the door disappears into a pile of debris clogging the foyer beyond. Hidden inside the heaps of straw, broken wood, and chunks of plaster is an old heavy crossbow that Hallod has rigged to fire a spear through the doorway if the rope is cut or otherwise released from the door. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.695,r=0.451,b=0.785), with ID 9a325eb5-e0dc-4f24-8bbc-e92a7a1955bc -->

Beyond the door, the foyer empties into a clearly
abandoned living space. The hearth is choked with
branches and debris from above, the furniture is
smashed and soiled, and a thick layer of dirt and
grime covers every surface. It is obvious that no
one has used this room in years. The only other exit
leads to a room thoroughly filled with debris from
the collapsed roof above. Digging through the debris
would take several hours at least and would likely
cause a further collapse of the ruined second story
above. If the PCs do find a way through, they enter
area F4 without needing to use the hidden window
entrance (F3). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.265,r=0.819,b=0.464), with ID 9cc63013-d4be-48a5-8987-f49bc3e38cd1 -->

F3. HIDDEN WINDOW ENTRANCE  
The footpath that leads around the house passes under a boarded-over window at the back of the house, then down to the stream where Hallod gets water. The boarded-over window is fake; Hallod nailed the boards onto a hinged shutter, allowing it to be opened with ease. This ruse is not simple to detect, but careful inspection and a successful DC 16 Perception check uncovers it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.477,r=0.818,b=0.616), with ID 152ba81d-5e29-4af1-82b2-3ad2ee67fdc5 -->

The shutter is latched from the inside, and there  
does not appear to be a keyhole of any sort, but due  
to its roughly constructed nature, the shutter can  
be opened with a successful DC 16 Thievery check  
(trained) or Forced Open with a successful DC 18  
Athletics check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.618,r=0.818,b=0.708), with ID af4dbd67-62f5-40bb-9bcf-d08a9239a59d -->

F4. CRAWLWAY AND HATCH  
The shuttered entrance leads to a room filled with debris from the collapsed roof. There’s just enough room for two Medium creatures to stand in this space, and a cursory inspection from this spot uncovers a crawlway under the debris. Unlike everything else, this crawlway is mostly free from grime and dust. Characters can move through the crawlway only in single file. Medium creatures can crawl 5 feet per action; Small and smaller creatures can move at normal speed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.722,r=0.818,b=0.877), with ID cc126441-dff1-473e-b3a4-e4818bd246f4 -->

Hazard: After 15 feet, the crawlway takes a left turn. There is a trap located in the floor at this spot. Anyone putting pressure on the floor where the crawlway turns sets off the trap: debris rains down <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.879,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID f4cadfb6-ae95-4e9e-b833-82402616bed6 -->

FALLING DEBRIS                        HAZARD 1

MECHANICAL   TRAP

Stealth DC 17 (trained)
Description A pressure-sensitive floorboard connects to a beam holding up debris in the crawlway’s ceiling.

Disable Thievery DC 15 (trained) on the floorboard before the debris falls
AC 16; Fort +8, Ref +2
Hardness 5; HP 20 (BT 10); Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Falling Debris Trigger Pressure is placed on the floorboard. Effect The ceiling in the crawlway collapses in the square where the passage turns, and also in the two adjacent squares. Anyone in these three squares takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage. For the creature in the center square, where the trap is triggered, this is a basic save. Creatures in the two adjacent squares take no damage on a success or critical success as they avoid the falling debris entirely, but take full damage on a failed save, and take double damage on a critical failure. Creatures that take damage from the debris are immobilized, trapped under the crushing weight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.167,r=0.525,b=0.540), with ID 6d9179c5-6846-40ac-9245-69eed65386a3 -->

Clearing out a square of debris requires a successful DC 17 Athletics skill check, with the following effects.
  Critical Success The square is cleared in 1 minute.
  Success The square is cleared in 5 minutes.
  Failure The square is cleared in 10 minutes.
  Critical Failure The ceiling above the square collapses further, dealing an additional 2d6 to the character digging out the square and any character trapped in that square. This takes 1 minute and no progress is made. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.190,t=0.541,r=0.526,b=0.695), with ID 1f4496ad-efcd-4f58-a80f-1ce62647dd8b -->

Beyond the turn, the crawlway continues for
another 10 feet before opening up into a small
chamber that appears to have once been a closet.
The door leaving the space is barred by debris on the
other side and cannot be opened, but there is a hatch
built into the floor. It is very old, but free from debris
and dust. The hatch is not locked, but the hinge is
terribly rusted. Opening it without making any noise
requires a successful DC 18 Thievery check, although
applying oil to the hinge reduces this to DC 12. If the
PCs make noise lifting the hatch, Hallod has even
more time to prepare for the PCs arrival, as noted
in F5, below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.708,r=0.525,b=0.906), with ID 14f08244-bfaf-46d0-ac5d-a730e27d6599 -->

almost 30 feet. Handholds have been carved into the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.908,r=0.525,b=0.940), with ID 23a62586-7280-4c43-94c1-01a4d5cb6235 -->

stone wall, but they are uneven and treacherous.
There is no light in the chute. Unless the PCs have
a way to bring light with them, climbing down the
chute requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check.
With light, the going is slow, but no check is required.
The chute ends in area F5, down in the basement.
  XP Award: For dealing with both of Hallod’s
hazards, award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.129,r=0.892,b=0.249), with ID 040987a4-7756-4f66-95e4-819a11f68d6f -->

F5. BASEMENT KENNEL                MODERATE 1
The chute deposits the PCs into a short hallway that leads to a wooden door. The door is not locked, and it leads into the deep basement of the house above. When the PCs open the door, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.261,r=0.891,b=0.356), with ID cff56e31-5b3c-4b11-8451-364cd8d4b8d9 -->

The old wooden door swings open on rusted hinges, revealing a room lit by a single, flickering torch. Through the gloom you see piles of small crates and more than a few barrels stacked up haphazardly on the south side of the room. Opposite you is a stout wooden door with iron bands, while the north side of the room is bare save for an iron gate set into the middle of the wall. The stench of smoke and damp dog hangs heavy in the air. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.370,r=0.890,b=0.495), with ID af9740cc-4de8-4b15-8922-78fbff7ff5fd -->

If the PCs made a great deal of noise in opening the hatch, Hallod had plenty of time to set up an additional danger for them by spilling a few pints of alchemical grease on the area in front of the door. The oil covers the square directly in front of the door and the squares adjacent to that one. Anyone attempting to move through these spaces by means other than a Step must attempt a DC 13 Acrobatics check or Reflex saving throw or fall prone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.510,r=0.890,b=0.646), with ID c6b6b368-7348-48b2-9bdc-ee38caef6e0d -->

The door leading out of this room into area **F6** is locked, but it can be opened with two successful DC 15 Thievery skill checks. It can also be Forced Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or by dealing 40 points of damage to the door (Hardness 10). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.648,r=0.890,b=0.739), with ID 559fa827-22d9-4f28-a434-a1febb47b77a -->

**Creatures:** Even if the PCs did not make noise while opening the hatch, they cannot possibly make it down the chute without alerting Hallod, who then stations himself beyond the wooden door to area **F6.** Watching through a slit in the door, he begins turning a wheel that raises the iron gate as soon as the PCs enter the room. This releases four angry and starving guard dogs into the room. Their barks and growls flood the room the moment the grate begins to move. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.741,r=0.890,b=0.892), with ID 959f9873-ed64-4d89-9e36-b6170b370948 -->

Roll initiative for the dogs as normal, but they all
lose one action on the first round as they wait for the
grate to fully open before charging in to attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.893,r=0.890,b=0.939), with ID 19a960c2-c6fd-45be-9138-33d85e8253ec -->

Rewards: Anyone searching through the barrels and crates finds them to be empty save for packing straw and scraps of cloth, but a successful DC 16 Perception check while digging through them uncovers 2 vials of lesser alchemist’s fire, forgotten underneath a pile of straw. A critical success at this check also reveals a small glass bottle filled with a murky, foul-smelling brown liquid. Identifying this liquid requires a DC 19 Crafting skill check. Success reveals that it is a foul alchemical reagent called corpse blood, used in a variety of alchemical items mostly related to disease, poison, or their antidotes. The box containing this bottle clearly once had 7 other bottles in it, all of which appear to be missing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.202,r=0.454,b=0.419), with ID 8d41b2f9-e611-41fd-90f0-a99e5e89786d -->

F6. HALLOD’S HOME  
This chamber is entered via a short hallway remarkable only for a large steel wheel on the wall; this opens the iron gate in area F5, behind which Hallod keeps his dogs. A viewing slit in the door to area F5 allows one to see into that room. Hallod flees immediately after releasing his guard dogs. He moves quickly through this area, exiting into the caves beyond where there are additional defenses and, more importantly, his stash of juggernaut mutagen. This leaves his living quarters unattended, but searching for clues here will take time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.430,r=0.453,b=0.616), with ID 6854600b-9772-4993-8f5a-efd2d9c9903a -->

The home is divided into three areas: the larder, the lavatory, and the living space. The larder is a simple storeroom filled with scraps of old meat, a third of a wheel of cheese, a sack of turnips, and a barrel of weak ale. There is also a crate of empty wine bottles in one corner. They are all of a good Chelish vintage and were probably quite valuable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.617,r=0.452,b=0.724), with ID 02b96a58-299e-4572-b670-755b897d8c86 -->

The lavatory sits just off the main living space, and
it is little more than an open pit. This is also where
Hallod disposes of his garbage, and there are scraps
of moldy food and bits of junk in the corners of the
room. Anyone who investigates can attempt a DC 15
Perception check to notice that there are a number
of small, identical bottles scattered among the trash.
Examining the bottles reveals they all have a silvery
residue in the bottom that smells strongly of iron
and something else terribly acrid. A successful DC
15 Crafting check reveals this to be remnants of a
juggernaut mutagen. A critical success on this check
uncovers that there is also something sweet-smelling
in the mix. (This is an addictive oil that Vilree started <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.725,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID b004583e-3e7c-4f0d-bee3-f955f6f86a16 -->

ensure that Hallod remained loyal to
her, but the PCs have no way of learning this
information just yet.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.126,r=0.784,b=0.188), with ID f03f6a36-210e-42dc-95bf-72a97401e3ff -->

The living area is a mess, with a cot in one
corner and a crude firepit in the other. A simple
chimney leads up from this room before connect-
ing to another in the house above. Bits of trash and a
few pieces of gear can be found with a simple search,
including a whetstone, a dagger, 15 feet of rope, a
hammer, 2 candles, and a coin purse with 2 gp, 8 sp,
and 14 cp. This area connects to the larder, to the
lavatory, to the short hallway leading back to the
kennel, and to an open passageway that leads off
into darkness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.190,r=0.818,b=0.355), with ID 7ab6e312-79a7-4a37-b5ed-c62303f9db71 -->

Hazard: The real prize to be found here is a strongbox located underneath the cot. Although it is not hard to find, it is made from stout wood, banded in iron, closed with a simple lock, and trapped. The chest can be opened with three successful DC 20 Thievery skill checks, or with the key that Hallod has in his pocket. In either case, attempting to open the box triggers the trap if it is not disarmed first. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.358,r=0.818,b=0.479), with ID 41d5288b-9d2e-460f-b6d5-77384e2754dc -->

**Rewards:** Inside the chest is a batch of 14 receipts that match the logs from Bort’s ledgers (see Bort’s Books on page 10), as well as a scrap of parchment that lists each transaction along with a value slightly higher than that listed on the corresponding receipt from Bort. The chest contains some of the gold that Hallod has skimmed from these transactions over the years (the reason for the difference in values). Although Hallod has spent much of the difference, the chest still contains 21 gp and 37 sp.

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar from a tabletop roleplaying game adventure module, listing the main sections of the adventure in a stylized, fantasy-themed frame.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical, ornate sidebar with a fantasy alchemical motif, including purple, organic-looking borders, glowing stars, and a potion bottle at the bottom.
  • The sidebar contains a list of adventure sections: "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder", "Part 2: The Ranger's Request", "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair", and "Adventure Toolbox".
  • The top of the sidebar features leafy plants and a stone sign with partial text: "The Fall of ...guestone".
  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and yellows, with magical glowing effects.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is clear and legible, with a fantasy-style font for headings.
  • The illustration is integrated into the page margin, suggesting a thematic design element rather than a data figure.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The sidebar runs vertically along the page edge, with the potion bottle at the bottom and the stone sign at the top.
  • The adventure section titles are centered within the sidebar, evenly spaced from top to bottom.

Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents for the adventure, enhancing immersion and visual appeal. The fantasy alchemical design reinforces the module's magical setting and tone. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.802,t=0.024,r=0.998,b=0.757), with ID 257da886-ddd1-4396-b216-0d970b036910 -->

the back of the transaction list is a crude map. It
depicts a cave helpfully labeled “HIDEOUT,” next to
a shape that might be a pond; from there, a winding
path passes through a strange V-shaped chamber
before ending at what appears to be a clearing with
a tree stump labeled “DROP POINT.” This is a map
to the place where Hallod drops off the supplies he
acquires, and where he received payments and drugs
from Vilree. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.264), with ID 1470e2d5-e156-4d0b-94d2-581e398340ab -->

The passageway leading from this chamber begins
as worked stone, but as it goes further and further, it
becomes more of a natural cavern passage, worked
only here and there to make it more passable. It
connects to area F7. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.265,r=0.525,b=0.341), with ID b0ae0f25-5428-4135-a70f-b20f2923da06 -->

**XP Award:** If the PCs discover the map in the chest, award the party 30 XP. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.341,r=0.525,b=0.372), with ID c0261c1a-7456-4ce5-8d34-aa3927c75517 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a fantastical serpent, labeled "Giant Lightning Serpent," depicted in a dynamic pose with its mouth open and emitting blue lightning from its mouth and tail.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a large, blue-green serpent with scales, shown in a coiled, upright position.
  • The serpent's mouth is wide open, displaying fangs and a forked tongue, with blue lightning arcing from its mouth.
  • The tail ends in a metallic, coil-like structure emitting bright blue lightning.
  • The background is plain white, focusing attention on the creature.
  • The color palette is dominated by shades of blue, teal, and green, with electric blue highlights for the lightning effects.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is highly detailed, with emphasis on the texture of the serpent's scales and the glow of the lightning.
  • The label "Giant Lightning Serpent" appears in a green box at the bottom left.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The serpent's head and upper body are in the foreground, with the tail receding into the background and curving back into view.
  • The lightning effects draw the viewer's eye from the mouth to the tail, emphasizing the creature's electrical theme.
  • The composition uses a dynamic, diagonal orientation, giving a sense of movement and aggression.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of power and danger, with the open mouth and lightning effects suggesting an imminent attack.
  • The use of bright blue lightning and metallic elements on the tail reinforces the creature's supernatural and electrical nature.
  • The plain background ensures the viewer's focus remains on the serpent and its dramatic features. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.123,t=0.386,r=0.573,b=0.893), with ID 4597531e-a16b-4d3b-a725-588580d93114 -->

F7. Snake Pool

Low 1
Beyond Hallod’s living quarters is a system of natural caves. Although the path is far from level, it has been worked to allow for easy travel; stalagmites have been cleared away in some spots and small wooden footbridges have been stretched over pools of stagnant water no more than 5 feet deep. After about 10 minutes of travel, the PCs arrive at a small cave with a larger, more ominous pool of water in the middle. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter this area. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.123,r=0.891,b=0.296), with ID ebeb345c-0851-47e6-9e9e-0acfadc08411 -->

The passageway opens up into a large natural chamber, the center of which is occupied by a pool of brackish water. Stalactites and stalagmites occupy much of the room, but a path between them leads around the pool and to another corridor on the opposite side of the cave. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.308,r=0.890,b=0.389), with ID e26486e3-317a-4429-a083-ad60dfeea9c0 -->

Creature: The moment the PCs enter the room, a strange blue glow emanates up from the pool, sending a cascade of shimmering light to the ceiling above. Seconds later, the head of a giant blue snake rises from the pool with sparks of electricity dancing between its fangs, while a metal, rattle-tipped tail pokes out of the water behind it, audibly building up a charge with every flick of the rattle.

The giant lightning serpent was a gift from Vilree to Hallod to protect his lair. It is loyal to the brute, but it gives no quarter to the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.401,r=0.891,b=0.568), with ID f482f812-0ada-4f1f-819d-6f4c391e6436 -->

Reward: At the bottom of the shallow pool is the body of an explorer who died here many years ago. Nothing more than bones now, the body has slowly been consumed by limestone that has calcified around its skeleton. A successful DC 15 Perception check spots the body.

F8. HALLOD’S AMBUSH        SEVERE 1
The tunnel beyond the snake’s lair twists and turns for a great distance; it takes the PCs 10 minutes to traverse it before they can detect a faint natural light up ahead, and the air becomes notably cleaner, smelling vaguely of grass. After another 5 minutes of travel, the tunnel opens up into a cave mouth. Read or paraphrase the following to the players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.337,r=0.452,b=0.465), with ID 7aec1115-5758-4a87-818f-b03a04a79833 -->

The tunnel you have been traversing opens into a cave, and you can see a forest beyond the cave’s mouth. The roots of a large tree block the middle of this entrance, as if the tree had grown into a hillside that has since eroded away. Beyond the tree is a large pond; a path around the water begins to one side beneath a curtain of moss hanging from the tree. The cave itself is piled high with two rows of neatly stacked crates and boxes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.478,r=0.451,b=0.604), with ID e18500ac-a295-4f80-906a-d8546af14c02 -->

This cave is where Hallod stored the reagents before delivering them to Vilree at the prearranged drop spot. The thug waits here for the players to arrive, and he has a few traps prepared for them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.617,r=0.451,b=0.677), with ID bcad60fa-a33e-420e-943d-faf56ab53956 -->

**Creature:** Hallod is a rough-looking man. He is bald and has a prominent scar running down his face from an axe wound he took years ago. He is wearing filthy leather armor and wields a nasty kukri with deadly efficiency. When the PCs enter the room, he hops up on a berm formed by the tree roots, aims his crossbow at them, and taunts them by saying, “I wondered when Bort’s lackeys would arrive. Let’s do this!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.679,r=0.451,b=0.800), with ID ff1c9e89-939d-499b-aac9-7d74a00b985a -->

Years ago, Hallod began making use of mutagens
supplied to him by Vilree, but unbeknownst to him,
they were laced with a drug that made them addictive.
Today, Hallod is totally hooked on mutagen and will
do whatever the alchemist demands so long as he can
get his fix. At the start of the fight, he drinks his lesser
juggernaut mutagen, then fires his crossbow and
waits for the PCs to come to him. This also forces
them to deal with his traps. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.802,r=0.451,b=0.939), with ID 34e387e0-541c-4f80-9d31-4eb173f9067a -->

Hallod,
The final shipment of corpse blood is due in just over a week, and it is the last thing I need from that greedy bastard, Bort. I've enclosed a parting gift for him that should ensure he never tells anyone of our dealings. Be sure that he gets it, my darling. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.243,t=0.148,r=0.815,b=0.285), with ID f6046fa1-2bff-4da4-b860-f9a151ead1c2 -->

Attack of Opportunity ↷  
Dirty Trick ◇ Trigger Hallod scores a critical hit with a melee attack. Effect Hallod can attempt an Athletics check to Shove or Trip the target of his attack. This uses the same multiple attack penalty as the attack, but it does not count as an additional attack for that penalty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.510,r=0.522,b=0.617), with ID 7ff15b67-42f2-40b1-8b3c-b1cb9ba40dca -->

One-Two Move  Hallod makes two Strikes, one with each hand; he usually attacks first with his kukri. If this first attack hits, the target is flat-footed to the second attack (which for Hallod is usually a fist Strike). The multiple attack penalty applies to these attacks as normal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.617,r=0.521,b=0.708), with ID 57ff7cb6-80e2-4276-9fd0-3befb89d5561 -->

**Sneak Attack** Hallod deals 1d6 extra precision damage to flat-footed creatures. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.709,r=0.512,b=0.740), with ID 6d384397-bce5-459f-9b36-8c11e0a45be6 -->

**Hazards:** Hallod has set up a pair of spear launcher traps in this room, with rather obvious trip lines stretching from wall to wall between the rows of barrels and crates (these ropes are marked on the map with dotted lines). Due to this obvious nature, anyone about to enter a space occupied by a trip line can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to notice the trigger. Those that fail trigger the trap. Once seen, the ropes are obviously avoided, but characters cannot end their move in a space occupied by a rope without setting off the trap. Even if the PCs do not trigger the traps, Hallod <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.754,r=0.524,b=0.939), with ID 43636d56-00f4-463c-b3e8-4949dadaffe0 -->

In addition, if a character is pushed into a crate or box, the container collapses into a pile of broken wood and debris. The character must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d4 piercing damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.434,r=0.891,b=0.511), with ID f63f37ec-7acb-4a7c-b27a-9a328e12cdac -->

Rewards: Hallod has the key that opens the strongbox in area F6, and the crates here are not all empty.

**Last Missive:** Folded up in Hallod’s pocket is a note written on a scrap of parchment. It is in Vilree’s handwriting, which is distinctly unlike any of the other writing the PCs have encountered in the adventure to this point. The style is plain and very severe, as if self-taught. See the handout above for details of Vilree’s last missive to Hallod. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.709,r=0.891,b=0.816), with ID e9434d58-8815-49fd-ab31-219954b699c2 -->

The Drop Point  
Located about 3 miles outside Etran’s Folly, the drop point on Hallod’s map is little more than a large hollow tree stump in a small clearing. Inside are a few empty crates, but nothing of value. Knowing this location, however, it vital to learning the location of Vilree’s true lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.829,r=0.891,b=0.938), with ID 2bad2ac1-cebd-40f0-aa3e-643335cc6cbc -->

UNSOLVED MURDER  
In tracking down Hallod and exploring his hideout, the players have made significant progress in determining who caused the untimely demise of Bort the dwarf merchant. Unfortunately, the villain who ordered the murder is still at large. Even worse, there’s no way to learn where this mysterious “V” might be found. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.120,r=0.457,b=0.249), with ID 4de2a9e0-9674-440b-85c7-462326f1758e -->

Taking this information to Rolth only adds to the
inept sheriff’s worry. Worse than a simple murder,
the PC’s investigation has uncovered a nefarious plot
involving secret agents and clandestine deliveries,
with roots stretching back many years. These events
do clear the name of the PCs and of the members
of the caravan, but the sheriff pleads with the PCs
to help him uncover the true culprit. There are two
other factors at play here: Tamli’s desire for closure,
and the appearance of a mysterious ranger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.250,r=0.456,b=0.402), with ID 3bc07cc2-989b-45a0-b70d-6401e2d8b6d7 -->

Tamli is keen to hear what happened in the caves underneath Hallod’s home. She listens with rapt attention, the knuckles on her clenched hands white with tension, as the story unfolds. Although she is relieved that the man directly responsible for Bort’s death has been caught, she grows quiet at the revelation that there was someone else involved. After a moment of silence, she asks how the PCs plan to find the mastermind behind all this, expecting the group to continue the search. Should they balk, a pained look crosses her face, and she retrieves her coin purse to offer them 43 gp in assorted coins to continue the investigation. It is her entire savings, but finding the killer means that much to her and the others. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.403,r=0.456,b=0.617), with ID c9e8c4c0-f779-4913-9d0f-f3359961605c -->

Around this time (or perhaps just before the heroes go to Hallod’s home), a mysterious ranger comes to town dragging a sledge and burdened by the carcasses of several wolves. The body of the caustic wolf from the beginning of this adventure is among the corpses (if the PCs did not bury it). The ranger is looking for whoever is responsible (see the Ranger’s Request on page 24 for more information). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.617,r=0.456,b=0.742), with ID f9773e86-3a17-4a70-9989-d90f54f23a9e -->

Hallod Lives?
It is possible that the PCs took Hallod alive, subduing him rather than killing him. If so, Sheriff Rolth has the thug bound to a post in a locked barn just outside town. Hallod is under constant watch, being held until the circuit judge arrives to mete out justice. The PCs are free to question him, but he refuses to say much of anything until the withdrawal from his mutagen addiction begins to take hold, which takes 3 or 4 days. At that point, Hallod will say just about anything to get another dose. Alternatively, the PCs might be able to coerce information out of Hallod or <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.750,r=0.456,b=0.942), with ID d97daa80-4fb5-41c2-b924-9af5b76fc223 -->

THE SECRET OF VILREE  
Vilree’s identity and history are not meant  
to be a great secret, but the PCs should have to  
invest some effort in uncovering her backstory.  
There are many people around town who are  
old enough to remember the plague and the dark  
years that followed it, most notably Edra Wythe,  
Delma and Targen Fulst, and Flonk, who picked  
up the tale shortly after he arrived (although  
his details might be suspect). Most have some  
recollection of the events concerning Silwyth the  
alchemist and her feud with Father Bolgrist, the  
town priest; if pressed, they remember that Silwyth  
had a daughter named Vilree who survived the  
plague but disappeared a few years after. The most  
likely source of this tale is Targen Fulst, who tells  
part of it when the PCs take him on a tour of the  
town (page 12). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.113,r=0.818,b=0.415), with ID 4cda6ec8-5035-4268-a440-d3a6c3c718b2 -->

talk him into revealing a few details by using skills
(mostly likely Diplomacy and Intimidation), subject
to your discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.433,r=0.820,b=0.479), with ID 690af53d-36a2-42c0-b8fe-c6695d73419f -->

In any case, Hallod is not too bright and actually
knows very little about his employer’s plans. He
knows her name is Vilree, and that she once lived
in Etran’s Folly, but he does not know when or
why she left. He met her about six years ago, when
he chanced upon her in the woods. He found her
roasting beetles from nearby trees and collecting
the ashes, and she invited him to share her fire
and her wine. He was enchanted by her strange
countenance—she has big eyes and pointed ears,
but not so pointed as an elf’s. They met several
times over the next few months, and while Hallod
was smitten, Vilree never returned the affection.
Hoping to prove himself, Hallod began to do small
tasks for her, and she began to use him to smuggle
goods back and forth from Etran’s Folly via the
cave network underneath his home. He never
learned where she lived, and as time went on, they
met in person less and less. Vilree is busy, he says;
she has important work to do (not that Hallod
has any idea what that is). He has not seen her in
person for over a year now, and they communicate
only by notes left at their prearranged drop point.
He gets her whatever she asks for; in return, she
pays him and makes sure he has an ample supply
of his additive mutagen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.480,r=0.820,b=0.877), with ID 078c451c-2644-4a5a-a145-4a4a9fc327c8 -->

Hallod has no further role to play in this adventure.
If left in Rolth’s custody, he is taken away by the circuit judge in a month’s time to serve in a labor mine for the rest of his life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.878,r=0.822,b=0.940), with ID 838875bf-f64a-4f2b-9521-17d339b18b16 -->

  • The use of lighting and composition draws attention to the central conflict and highlights the fantasy adventure theme.
  • The decorative border and title suggest this is an introductory or chapter image for a role-playing game or fantasy story segment. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.003,r=0.997,b=0.559), with ID 39e3f217-32be-45ef-a938-3be26cbc6049 -->

This part of the adventure can occur anytime after the PCs arrive in town, but preferably after a few days have passed—perhaps during the investigation into Bort’s death. It begins when Noala Kessir, an elven ranger, comes to Etran’s Folly looking for the people who killed several wolves just outside of town. She had been tracking the beasts, including their mutated leader, and is relieved to see them put down. She hopes to find those responsible, as they might be hardy enough to help her root out the cause of these corrupted animals. She asks around town until she is directed to the PCs. Once this occurs, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.177,t=0.570,r=0.527,b=0.772), with ID 9cfab212-52c8-43f1-83f0-2180724c9153 -->

A woman shrouded in a heavy brown cloak trimmed with leaves marches up to you, pulling a simple wooden sledge behind her. As she approaches, she brings the sledge to one side and uncovers her cargo, a pile of wolf carcasses. She turns to you, and despite having her cloak’s hood pulled low, you can make out weathered lips and a slender chin. In a pointed tone, she asks, “Is this your work?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.783,r=0.525,b=0.896), with ID 19a79bb1-ac75-4476-8c8e-cc24153757e0 -->

Noala has been serving these woods for many years,
having retired here after fighting in the Goblinblood wars. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.907,r=0.526,b=0.942), with ID 9924b879-684a-4118-89e7-c818fbb0874a -->

It was a conflict that left her broken, but not defeated.
Hoping to find purpose after all the violence, she found
these people in need and decided to stay. No one in
town has any particular reason to trust her, but she
does not need their trust to keep the folk and the wilds
from abusing one another. The only person who has
any regular dealings with Noala is Delma, who sells her
supplies and reassures her that the community values
her work. Delma has also made it clear that she hopes to
make the ranger’s role one that is officially supported by
the town, once her father finally retires. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.572,r=0.892,b=0.739), with ID d4648816-b3dd-48ec-8c8b-4ac90a2f3eb8 -->

Noala is suspicious of others, but the aging ranger
recognizes that things have slowly been getting worse
and, as she’s nursing an arm injury, the crisis is beyond
her ability to solve alone. She hopes that the PCs will
help her get to the bottom of the blight that has taken
hold of the wilderness around Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.741,r=0.892,b=0.832), with ID 8970d35d-36eb-4b2d-b1cd-fa1361f30fae -->

# THE BLIGHT
For the past several years, there has been an ever-growing blight in the region. What started a few years ago with a single group of sickly trees has become a series of seemingly unconnected pockets of dead and dying plants. Worse still, some of the animals <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.842,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID 10eef603-dfd0-4711-baa9-35fbac3fd830 -->

living near these areas have strange mutations and
have turned hostile to travelers and locals alike.
There is no obvious cause. The only common
element is that in each afflicted area,
the blight seems to start in a
grove of very large, old trees.
What Noala does not realize is
that below the surface, the deep
taproots of these older trees
are absorbing groundwater
polluted by alchemical runoff
and discarded reagents from
Vilree’s secret lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.125,r=0.545,b=0.332), with ID 37de8162-9efc-4fcb-b908-160ab7b3c83b -->

her right hand, which is entirely covered in an
oddly shaped leather gauntlet. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.124,r=0.760,b=0.173), with ID 3c935306-2db6-4d2a-973b-c2580bef8f46 -->

“These wolves aren’t the first, and I am afraid they won’t be the last. Worse still,”  
she grunts, as she begins to drag the body of the caustic wolf to the fire, “the forest itself is turning sour. Plants and trees are withering, bearing bitter fruit that sickens and kills those who eat it. If you’ve been out to the old orchard, you’ve seen it. The blight is growing, and I need your help to stop it.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.520,t=0.172,r=0.821,b=0.329), with ID 361a8768-1ec9-4b94-8f13-729fbdc6359d -->

Noala’s proposition is simple. She  
explains what she knows about the  
blight and asks the PCs to accompany  
her to these dying parts of the woods  
and get to the bottom of it. While the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.553,t=0.337,r=0.819,b=0.419), with ID fd6f9231-44e4-452e-aa64-ec617da72f82 -->

and they always seem to
have a mundane explanation
for what’s happening: it’s just
a bad summer, or maybe a pig died
in the stream a few months back. Noala
knows it is something more, and while she
has done all she can to keep the people safe and put
down any blighted creatures, she simply cannot solve
this problem on her own. Several months ago, after
cataloging the locations of the largest blights, she went
to Sheriff Rolth with Delma’s blessing, hoping that he
might request aid from the local baron. Unfortunately,
the lazy sheriff has no time for “tree problems,” and he
pointedly refused to help her or even inform anyone
else of the danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.369,r=0.455,b=0.601), with ID 761a85ba-f958-49ae-9bb8-f0d717fbdef2 -->

Now things are worse than ever, and some of the
blights are showing signs that the plants themselves
are changing, becoming something else. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.601,r=0.454,b=0.651), with ID 1362cb0b-3c21-416b-83b3-8e5ea168d675 -->

A SIMPLE TASK
Noala fears that if she does not get to the bottom of
this problem soon, it may spread to the farms and
fields, affecting the town and even spreading further
than this small community. In this desperate hour,
she sees the PCs as her best chance at success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.656,r=0.454,b=0.755), with ID 4954a507-a60f-440a-b150-f9372c25a9a8 -->

After introducing herself, she asks if they might
accompany her out into the woods where she can
burn the wolves’ bodies and talk in private. If the
PCs would rather discuss things in town, the disposal
of the wolf corpses can wait. Assuming they find a
quiet place to talk, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.755,r=0.455,b=0.850), with ID 8e03d1b9-e249-48c5-9a3d-5491c8e69401 -->

The mysterious woman leads you to a clearing in the woods, not far from the town itself, where a small fire is already burning in a carefully kept fire pit. She tosses back her hood to reveal long, elven ears and deep, emerald eyes. With one hand, she begins to drag the wolf <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.860,r=0.455,b=0.943), with ID 86fd7bea-8eb5-4df9-8242-455771f965d4 -->

Noala’s proposition is simple. She
explains what she knows about the
blight and asks the PCs to accompany
her to these dying parts of the woods
and get to the bottom of it. While the
characters might not want to take on <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.337,r=0.820,b=0.435), with ID f5a620f7-6b34-4d03-88d4-8828abfdb695 -->

characters might not want to take on  
this mission merely out of generosity,  
Noala offers to train them in wilderness  
survival skills and ranged combat techniques if they  
agree to help her (see Noala’s Training in the Rules  
and Rewards section on page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.421,r=0.818,b=0.512), with ID 3e62e5f6-54e6-4f99-be74-71f4d20a904c -->

Any offer to help her burn the corpses is gladly accepted, but Noala refuses to talk about her hand, saying only that it is an old wound. If pressed, she offers up that maybe it is a tale worth telling, but only after the blight is dealt with. See Noala’s entry in the NPCs Around Town appendix on page 53 for more information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.510,r=0.819,b=0.617), with ID 05bd46c8-6b63-442f-adda-3fbee430bd6f -->

If the PCs have already defeated Hallod, they might
suspect that these blights and the mysterious “V” are
in some way related. Noala knows nothing of Vilree,
but the fact that there is someone working with vile
reagents strikes her as unlikely to be a coincidence.
She suggests that finding the cause of the blight might
help track down the person behind Bort’s death. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.617,r=0.821,b=0.724), with ID 8fabd8b0-f3f9-465a-83da-e42952acecb9 -->

If the PCs agree, Noala offers to take them to a
nearby blight in the morning, perhaps moving on to a
larger one deeper in the forest if necessary. She tells the
PCs to pack for a lengthy journey, as the largest blight
is located deep in the woods and is hard to reach on
foot. If the PCs have not yet caught Hallod, they may
have to do so before being able to leave town without
provoking Rolth’s ire. Noala is willing to wait for the
PCs, but she stresses the urgency of the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.724,r=0.822,b=0.863), with ID 45247ce9-285d-4f25-8964-38eeedbd79a1 -->

# THE BLIGHTED DEN
When the PCs are ready to go exploring with Noala, she arranges to meet them just outside of town at the site of the wolf ambush. Noala arrives at first light. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.872,r=0.821,b=0.941), with ID 65f1d942-3adb-48c4-9375-3f0024ba56e5 -->

Summary : This is a top-down illustrated battle map titled "The Blighted Den," designed for tabletop roleplaying games. The map shows a forest clearing with labeled encounter areas, terrain features, and a grid for movement measurement.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a forested area with a clearing and a cave, labeled "The Blighted Den."
  • A grid overlays the map, with each square representing 5 feet.
  • A compass rose in the lower left indicates cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).

Keys & Annotations :
  • Two labeled encounter areas: "G1" (central clearing) and "G2" (cave chamber).
  • "THE BLIGHTED DEN" is labeled in the upper left.
  • "1 SQUARE = 5 FEET" is noted in the lower right.
  • A pool of water is illustrated in the cave (G2), and a creature token is present.
  • Three tree stumps or logs are in the clearing (G1), and a large fallen log is to the north.
  • Stairs and large tree roots connect the clearing to the cave entrance.

Ordering :
  • The map is oriented with north at the top.
  • The main path enters from the east, leading west into the clearing (G1), then up stairs and roots into the cave (G2).

Analysis :
  • The map is structured for tactical encounters, with clear movement paths and terrain features for cover or obstacles.
  • The cave (G2) is separated from the clearing (G1) by elevation and natural barriers, suggesting a defensible position.
  • The grid and scale support precise movement and positioning for gameplay. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.023,t=0.005,r=0.995,b=0.549), with ID fbe36e8a-75cb-4574-81da-fd3d3c79ee8f -->

Once all have gathered, she explains her general
plan. She will lead the PCs to the nearby blight, which
the PCs will enter and explore. Noala will roam
around the site, setting up snares on common trails
and ensuring that any stray creatures flushed out of
the area are contained. The PCs might question this
plan, but Noala persists, claiming that her wilderness
skills allow her to excel at hunting, not close combat.
Once the area is cleared, she hopes to investigate it
fully to see if there is anything to be learned. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.570,r=0.525,b=0.724), with ID 2e9fd4c6-0f52-47e0-83ab-5e8151146bb6 -->

Traveling to the first blight takes about 3 hours on
foot. Mounts do nothing to hasten this pace, as the
trail is little more than a winding game path. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.724,r=0.524,b=0.771), with ID 41495646-c682-427e-9ace-ff0fa7223d59 -->

G1. ROTTEN COPSE                        SEVERE 2
The first sign that the PCs are approaching the blight is that the plants in the area are a sickly shade of green with spots of brown. Soon, the forest smells of sweet rot, and the trees look entirely unhealthy, their bark peeling off in sticky black strips. Once they reach this point, read or paraphrase the following to the players. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.782,r=0.524,b=0.895), with ID a8399c21-34f9-40e7-9d2f-493b526669e1 -->

The presence of rot increases with every step you take, and Noala slows to a stop, turns to look at you, saying, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.907,r=0.523,b=0.941), with ID b0e2db61-ea0b-4cbd-b0be-8b8762332a77 -->

“This is where those wolves came from, I am sure of it. Somewhere ahead is their den, but I will leave that for you to explore. If you need my help, you will find me out here. I am going to set up snares and make sure nothing gets out of this rotten copse.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.570,r=0.892,b=0.650), with ID 992de487-9953-496a-8710-60e051719b5a -->

From here, the players need only follow the trail into the heart of this small blight. As they travel, the ground softens and squelches underfoot due to the sticky runoff from all the dying plants. Soon after, the trail opens into an area with tall trees but little underbrush. The path continues toward the rotting remains of a truly titanic tree and, under its roots, there appears to be a small cave. Unfortunately, there is danger here, blocking the PCs’ path. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.663,r=0.891,b=0.800), with ID 1a537604-14f6-4286-af62-74665bc3f1eb -->

**Creatures:** In the center of the clearing is a trio of small, sickly-looking thorn bushes grouped together. If the PCs scrutinize the bushes from a distance of at least 30 feet, they can attempt DC 18 Perception checks to notice that there appears to be a wolf carcass on the ground between them, and the plants have wrapped their tendrils around the corpse. If the characters approach to within 20 feet, the bloodlash bushes shake violently and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.802,r=0.890,b=0.939), with ID cf638eb8-7d43-4da3-9a3d-052f4171aa92 -->

G2. Foul Den                                            Severe 2
After dealing with the bushes, the characters are free to explore the den underneath the old, rotting tree. Anyone approaching the opening picks up the overpowering smell of wet and rotten fur coming from the hole. Unfortunately, the hole is not quite big enough for the PCs to enter without getting on their hands and knees. Should the PCs climb inside, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.184,r=0.453,b=0.328), with ID d6c55520-ba0d-4b20-8605-ee3a77bc1957 -->

The narrow tunnel is slick with foul-smelling mud. It leads down into a cramped den lit by a shimmering pool of oily water. The chamber stinks of wet fur and sickness. Next to the pool, between the gnarled and dying tree roots, is the rotting carcass of what must have once been a truly gigantic wolf. Nosing around it is a pair of hairless mutant wolves, their bodies deformed by large pustules and tumors. Although they have no eyes, they clearly detect your presence, for they turn their heads at you and snarl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.338,r=0.452,b=0.482), with ID ef440121-6f41-430e-a36c-fdaefa5bf217 -->

The glowing pool provides the chamber with dim
light. Without additional light, creatures lacking
darkvision or low-light vision treat all creatures as
concealed. Due to the low ceiling in this chamber,
Medium or larger creatures treat the entire area as
difficult terrain. The roots and moss hanging from
the ceiling make it so that any creature more than
5 feet away is screened from ranged attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.493,r=0.452,b=0.617), with ID 35554b85-becc-4098-8791-ee9ff3ddb480 -->

**Creatures:** The mutant wolves are the last survivors of the pack that attacked the PCs, living here in the den with the corpse of their mother. They are hairless, eyeless, and their blood is an alchemical soup. They do not respond until two characters are in the room, but then they snarl and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.618,r=0.452,b=0.708), with ID 4ccfc3a7-4508-4878-9e14-3b3d4a22e86d -->

**Polluted Pool:** Once the wolves are dealt with, the characters can freely investigate the glowing, oily pool in the center of the den. It is not particularly deep and is fed by a natural spring that wells up from deep below the ground. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting, or a DC 20 Nature or Occult check, recognizes that this water is tainted by something unnatural. A critical success on this check reveals that the chemicals are mutagenic in nature, causing those who drink it to change, often at a terrible price. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.219,r=0.819,b=0.371), with ID b68166dc-adff-4123-a3b5-6af5c1c6feaa -->

The water gives off an acrid smell, and anyone who touches it notices it has an odd, oily texture. Although it is not dangerous to touch once or twice, the water leaves the skin feeling prickly, and prolonged exposure quickly provokes a mild rash. Anyone foolish enough to drink the water must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save against the ingested toxin. A character that fails this save is sickened 1 for 1 hour. A character that critically fails also takes 1d6 acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.373,r=0.817,b=0.525), with ID 87a67d4d-7240-44cf-b720-c90a87177d98 -->

**XP Award:** Discovering the polluted pool is an important step toward uncovering what is going on in the forest; award the party 30 XP for its discovery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.526,r=0.817,b=0.572), with ID 3d841ced-6e7e-44ab-ba96-80baf5563e3e -->

NOALA’S NEXT MOVE  
When the PCs are done in the Blighted Den, they find Noala burning a pair of mangy wolf bodies—stragglers that she caught trying to sneak out of the den after the PCs went in. She is eager to hear what the PCs discovered. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.581,r=0.818,b=0.677), with ID 0f7092d0-a0b6-4376-b53b-78f737cca105 -->

She agrees that the water must be the source of the
pollution, but how the water is being contaminated
is still a mystery. Noala knows of no caves nearby
that contain access to any significant source of water.
Without an obvious lead, Noala suggests they travel
to the oldest, largest blight in these woods. This
will require a one-day journey through unforgiving
wilderness. She suggests they set off at once, but
she will wait until morning if the PCs would rather
return to Etran’s Folly to rest. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.679,r=0.818,b=0.831), with ID 118fa1ea-0da9-4553-9ca3-c13715599bcd -->

# THE PEN
Deep in the forest to the north of town is a blight larger
and older than any other. Noala became aware of it
only once the blight had spread. She has monitored
the blight’s growth, but she has never fully explored
this area, as it is home to ferocious predators. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.842,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 1525ddbc-353e-4a2d-9317-fc62a96027d8 -->

Summary : This is a detailed battle map for tabletop role-playing games, depicting a transition from an outdoor forested area into a cave complex with multiple labeled chambers and features.

map:
Scope & Reference :
  • The map covers a forested area leading into a cave system, with a grid overlay where 1 square equals 5 feet.
  • A north arrow is present for orientation.
  • The map is labeled with locations H1 through H8, as well as "THE PEN" and several markers (V, X).

Keys & Annotations :
  • Labeled areas: H1 (outdoor forest), H2 (stone circle or ritual site), H3 (cave entrance), H4 (cave chamber with pool and cauldron), H5 (sleeping quarters or study), H6 (refuse or storage), H7 (antechamber with stairs), H8 (large ritual chamber with altar), "THE PEN" (enclosure at the back of the cave).
  • Markers: Multiple "V" and "X" symbols scattered in the forested area, possibly denoting traps, creatures, or points of interest.
  • Pathways: A main path leads from the forest into the cave, branching to different chambers.
  • Environmental features: Trees, logs, and rocks in the forest; stone walls and natural rock formations in the cave.

Ordering :
  • The map is organized from bottom (south, outdoor) to top (north, deeper cave), with a clear progression from the forest into the cave system.
  • The cave complex is divided into distinct rooms connected by corridors and stairs.

Analysis :
  • The map is designed for tactical encounters, with clear zones for outdoor and indoor (cave) play.
  • The labeled rooms suggest a narrative or functional purpose for each area (e.g., ritual, rest, storage).
  • The presence of "THE PEN" at the deepest part of the cave may indicate a final objective or boss area.
  • The distribution of "V" and "X" markers in the forest suggests potential ambush points or hazards before entering the cave. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=-0.000,r=0.999,b=0.994), with ID f0e6c8ea-98b8-498c-8d0c-1f429bf1c160 -->

What Noala does not know is that this place was Vilree’s first home after leaving Etran’s Folly all those years ago. It was here that Vilree first experimented with her mother’s books and learned the basics of alchemy. Once her experiments outgrew these facilities, she looked for a new home and discovered a cavern complex in the foothills to the east she would later call “Spite’s Cradle.” Today she uses her old home here, now called the Pen, to test her concoctions on plants, animals and, more recently, humans, leaving much of the work to a small group of orcs that she enslaved three years ago. The brightest among the orcs has even begun experimenting with reagents, calling himself the Sculptor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.344), with ID 03d715e4-fbef-467c-aabb-2e08e2ab9c16 -->

Journey to the Pen  
The journey to the Pen is long and challenging. If the group hopes to arrive before nightfall, they must take no exploration tactic other than movement, covering ground as quickly as possible. Even then, they arrive with only an hour of daylight remaining, and they may opt to wait until morning. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.352,r=0.454,b=0.464), with ID ff6b276b-1624-4361-a8b9-7c4d06d9c8be -->

When the PCs finally do reach the area, they discover it resembles the blight surrounding the wolf den. The plants on the perimeter are sickly and dying. It is at this point that Noala again departs to patrol the perimeter. Before the PCs venture inside, Noala offers them 2 _lesser healing potions_ and 2 _barkskin potions_. After that, she heads off into the woods to begin her preparations. The PCs can take whatever time they need before pushing onward into the corruption. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.464,r=0.454,b=0.602), with ID 2bb3f18b-ff12-4541-8c06-91e5f40d6c3a -->

This blight is much stranger than the blight the PCs visited before. Here, the corruption manifests in distinct bands. The outer band is much like the area around the wolf den, with rotting trees and dying plants. Deeper in, all the plants have died; they are limp and rotten, and the air stinks with sweet decay. There are no birds or insects here, only the remains of creatures desperate enough to eat the poisonous plants. It takes just over 20 minutes to pass through each of these two bands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.602,r=0.454,b=0.755), with ID bd7ec383-01c4-4867-b365-fbe391671993 -->

Finally, the PCs enter the third area, where smaller
trees and plants seem to have returned to twisted life.
Their leaves drip with an oily sap, their branches are
gnarled yet strangely pliable, and their bark looks
like scales. Many of these plants are covered in odd
pustules that emit a faintly glowing light, and biting
gnats swarm around them. Swatting these gnats causes
them to burst into tiny flames that do no damage but
emit a terrible smell. Once the PCs reach this area, it
takes 1 hour to locate the heart of the blight, but a
PC who succeeds at a DC 17 Survival check uncovers
faint boot tracks that reduce this time to 30 minutes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.755,r=0.454,b=0.941), with ID 8813ddd5-0719-4567-b054-7870d9427ffa -->

H1. FOREST GUARDIANS

MODERATE 2

The Pen is built into the side of a hill in the middle of a field of twisted, poisonous brambles. There is only one way in, passing through Vilree’s plant guardians. When the PCs approach, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.120,r=0.801,b=0.239), with ID 695528fc-7297-48f5-b579-4753ff457ea4 -->

Deeper into this massive blight, the plants take on unnatural shades, and their branches seem to shudder and quake at the sensation of something passing. Up ahead is a wall of thick brambles with some sort of thorny iris in the center. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.246,r=0.819,b=0.315), with ID 0aaf4b6f-d6ae-426f-a334-4badc153b5c9 -->

The thorny iris is the doorway into the Pen itself,  
but before the PCs can reach it, they must pass by a  
number of forest guardians that have been cultivated  
here to keep intruders away. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.324,r=0.819,b=0.387), with ID 285c7e3c-b92b-4960-bb03-3deb8b439d1d -->

Creatures: Clustered near the gate are four vine lashers (each indicated on the map with a V), small creeping plants each with one large fibrous tendril that can reach out and grab creatures. These plants wait to attack until the PCs are close, holding them near the poison blooms (see Hazards below) as long as possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.388,r=0.820,b=0.482), with ID 07090fda-f16c-401d-a232-23c4bb463abe -->

Hazards: There are three large, colorful plants called poison blooms here (each indicated on the map with an X). If a non-plant creature approaches within 10 feet of any of these poison blooms, all three of them each unleash a cloud of mindfuddle gas that spreads out to a range of 20 feet. The poisonous gas remains in the area for 1 minute, and the poison blooms need 10 minutes to recharge before they can expel this gas again. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.554,r=0.820,b=0.680), with ID f2670500-4005-4396-ad98-51d5c23dacfb -->

**Thorn Iris:** The players are left with one final obstacle before they can enter the Pen: the thorn iris. This doorway, made up of thorny branches winding clockwise in a broad circle, does not have a handle or keyhole. It instead opens when one particular branch in the pattern is twisted. The branch is the only one in the entire iris pattern that winds counter-clockwise, making finding it something of a puzzle. Locating this branch requires a successful DC 18 Nature check or DC 23 Perception check.

H2. THE YARD                SEVERE 2

On the other side of the wall of brambles is a yard dominated by three large, wooden cages and a pool of bubbling sludge. A wretched-looking horse stands in one <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.259,r=0.526,b=0.345), with ID 1c4f6e55-5796-4606-8d8f-cd0085273e15 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy illustration of a horse composed entirely of stone, labeled "Stone Horse," depicted in a dynamic pose on a rocky surface.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a horse whose body, head, and limbs are made of rough, angular stone plates and cracks, giving the appearance of a living statue.
  • The horse is rearing up with one front leg raised, standing on a rocky outcrop.
  • The eyes glow with a yellowish light, adding a supernatural or magical effect.
  • The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and muted earth tones, consistent with stone and rock textures.
  • The background is mostly white, with some foliage visible on the left edge.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The only visible text is a label at the bottom reading "Stone Horse" in a serif font on a green background.
  • The illustration is detailed, with visible cracks and facets on the stone surface, and the hooves appear metallic or stone-like.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The horse is centrally positioned, occupying most of the frame.
  • The raised leg and head create a sense of movement and dominance.
  • The rocky ground beneath the horse anchors the figure and provides context for its stone composition.

Analysis :
  • The image conveys a sense of strength, durability, and magical animation, typical of fantasy creatures.
  • The glowing eyes and dynamic pose suggest the stone horse is not merely a statue but a living or enchanted being.
  • The detailed stone texture and anatomical accuracy blend realism with fantasy, making the creature both familiar and otherworldly. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.350,r=0.552,b=0.911), with ID a3b33399-b270-4418-b9ea-9e88af2286ab -->

of the cages, while another cage is filled with a swarm
of gigantic rats covered in white blisters. The third pen
looks empty, but it appears to be built around a small cave
located in the hillside. There is another cave entrance on
the north side, near one of the pens. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.125,r=0.891,b=0.205), with ID a7f2aa24-eb67-4ebb-aa3f-28d8e2e56e3b -->

This yard is used by the orcs to house some
of their more successful experiments, and while
these creatures are not exactly loyal, they are
quite dangerous when allowed to run free. This is
especially true if the PCs gave the orcs here ample
warning of their approach by destroying the thorn
iris instead of finding a way to open it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.218,r=0.891,b=0.325), with ID 85e786b6-d385-4c4c-8182-676e035f2611 -->

**Creatures:** There are two orcs in this area as well as the caged experiments. If the PCs catch the orcs unaware, one of them is dumping a bucket of sludge into the pool when the PCs open the iris, while the other is in front of the horse’s cage (the northernmost cage on the map). When combat starts, the first orc flings his bucket at the nearest PC, a ranged attack with a +4 bonus that deals 1d6 acid damage plus 1 persistent acid damage. He then charges up to attack. Meanwhile, the second orc opens the horse’s cage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.479), with ID f5c80f9f-4669-4e9e-9a5e-f94391be7fa3 -->

If the PCs alert the orcs to their approach, both are positioned at a cage door—one at the door with the horse, the other perched atop the cage with the rats. The moment the door is breached, the orcs open their respective cages, making this an especially deadly battle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.480,r=0.891,b=0.571), with ID ffbeb657-a2f5-46af-a10e-3967c4c4a102 -->

Opening a cage requires 2 actions (one to unlock the cage, and a second to open the door). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.565,t=0.571,r=0.890,b=0.602), with ID 5e44672f-4175-4c33-88b7-419035782c24 -->

North Cage: This cage contains a warhorse that the orcs have been experimenting on for some time now. Despite their ministrations and the creature’s half-starved condition, the beast is loyal to them. Its flesh has a stony appearance and its hooves appear to be made of metal. The moment the horse’s cage is open, it dashes forward to attack. If for some reason the door is not opened, the horse grows very agitated as the orcs are slain. When the last of them falls, it rears up to shatter the door of its pen and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.679,r=0.892,b=0.861), with ID 7af27b2f-45a6-45dc-9c4d-118461d5684b -->

**South Cage:** This cage appears to be empty, but the floor is littered with the bones of previous inhabitants and scraps from the meals that fed them.

Hazard: The large pool of toxic sludge in the center of this area is a hazard to any who draw near. Randomly determine the direction of the wind at the start of the fight by rolling 1d8; a result of 1 indicates the wind is blowing north, a 2 is northeast, and so on, moving clockwise to an 8, which indicates the wind is blowing northwest. The fumes are especially strong in the direction indicated, creating a draft that stretches 20 feet from the pool. Any creature that starts its turn in this draft takes 1d4 acid damage and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (falling into or entering the pool deals an extra 1d4 acid damage in addition to the normal effect). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.740,r=0.452,b=0.940), with ID d52823e7-d900-41cf-a032-0234da7c0e0f -->

Each round, check to see if the wind shifts
slightly by rolling 1d8; on a result of 1–2,
the wind shifts one direction clockwise (from
south to southwest, for example), on a result of
3–6 it stays the same, and on a result of 7–8 it
shifts one direction counterclockwise. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.126,r=0.790,b=0.218), with ID 89141ffe-7ca5-47e9-995c-eac94bc07dec -->

Regardless of the wind direction and the acid  
fumes, anyone adjacent to the toxic pool at the start  
of their turn takes 1d4 acid damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.219,r=0.817,b=0.264), with ID 0e7fc4fa-f0f7-4c2f-a38c-c44c6eb35317 -->

### H3. The Black Cave
This cage appears empty, but at the back of it, a crevasse opens up into a small cave that contains another experimental creature: a fiery leopard. As the result of a more recent experiment, it has not been trained and is not loyal, so the orcs do not release it against the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.276,r=0.818,b=0.372), with ID 7678ea24-c59a-4d16-8262-d6f381312f64 -->

Opening the cage door does not anger the leopard
or cause it to attack. Instead, it waits inside the
cave, in agony from experiments performed upon it
by the orcs. When the PCs enter the cave, read or
paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.373,r=0.819,b=0.450), with ID 14e0ccda-bf85-43cc-ba6f-d918f4cb1b41 -->

Stepping inside the cave, a cloud of smoke hovering around the ceiling becomes visible. Curled up in the back of the cave is a cat that looks to be on fire. It glares at the sight of another creature entering, letting out a weak snarl that fades into a plaintive yowl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.462,r=0.818,b=0.543), with ID a99c9db8-e112-4f4e-a858-64982e6bac5c -->

**Creature:** The fiery leopard is in far too much pain to fight the PCs unless they provoke it. Even if attacked, it looks for any opportunity to flee the situation. A character trained in Nature can approach the leopard and calm it with a successful DC 14 Diplomacy skill check (if the character has Wild Empathy) or a DC 19 Nature skill check. A critical failure on this check causes it to attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.819,b=0.678), with ID c42c11b6-0d4d-4f28-a621-b5ca17254285 -->

Although the fiery leopard will not allow itself
to be handled, and anyone attempting to touch it
takes 1 point of fire damage, the PCs can alleviate
the animal’s suffering if they can first calm it. Most
obviously, the poor creature is in need of water,
but any it tries to drink is quickly boiled off by the
leopard’s intense heat. Chilling the water first with
a ray of frost or similar effect allows the leopard
to hydrate before its fire evaporates the water. A
successful DC 15 Medicine check reveals that the
leopard has also been wounded, probably by the orcs
when they were handling it. Healing the fiery leopard
for 3 Hit Points restores it to full health. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.325), with ID 7d4cb21c-630d-447a-9378-0093bd88d0e0 -->

If the PCs hydrate the leopard and heal its wounds,
it perks up noticeably. At this point, it just wants to
escape this place; if the PCs allow it, the leopard
bolts out of the cage, into the yard, up a wall, and
out of the Pen. Alternatively, the PCs might try to
transfer the leopard to a new cage and move it, but
that is difficult even after it has been healed. It does
not fully trust the characters, and touching it still
results in fire damage. The chance of success here is
up to you to decide, but it should at least involve
a few skill checks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.326,r=0.525,b=0.493), with ID f4626d12-56b6-4fad-a6dc-c08ddba4e9f7 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a leopard with flames emanating from its body, accompanied by a label reading "Fiery Leopard".

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a snarling leopard, depicted in a dynamic, aggressive pose with its mouth open and teeth bared.
  • Flames are illustrated as emerging from various parts of the leopard's body, including its back, legs, and tail, giving the impression that the animal is on fire.
  • The leopard stands on a dark, flat rock or platform.
  • The background is plain white, isolating the subject.
  • The colour palette features naturalistic leopard fur tones (yellows, browns, and blacks) contrasted with bright orange and yellow flames.

Technical Details : 
  • There is a rectangular label at the bottom right of the image with the text "Fiery Leopard" in white on a dark green background.
  • No scale bar, magnification, or scientific annotation is present.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The leopard is positioned centrally, with its body angled toward the viewer and its left forepaw extended forward.
  • Flames are distributed across the body, with some extending above the head and along the limbs and tail.
  • The label "Fiery Leopard" is placed in the lower right foreground, partially overlapping the rock.

Analysis : 
  • The illustration conveys a sense of power, aggression, and supernatural or magical energy, emphasizing the "fiery" aspect through the integration of flames with the animal's natural form.
  • The plain background and central placement focus attention entirely on the leopard and its fiery effects. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.066,t=0.497,r=0.533,b=0.945), with ID d6720b3c-9ccb-4427-a069-4dda2dc0e141 -->

If the characters help and release the leopard, they might see it again; if a character has the right feats, they might acquire the unique creature as an animal companion (see the Rules and Rewards section on page 57 for details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.891,b=0.203), with ID 1b9bd264-0fcc-4081-b30b-5e21b4543322 -->

H4. FOREST LABORATORY                MODERATE 2

The bright light from outside is replaced by flickering torchlight in a narrow passageway cut deeply into the hillside. Suddenly, the passage opens into a broad natural cavern containing a series of large tables on the far side of the room. A series of alchemical experiments, most bubbling and frothing as they cook, are arranged atop the work spaces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.245,r=0.891,b=0.388), with ID 63734029-7f59-4d1c-8e46-7189f47c3695 -->

This chamber is the primary alchemical workshop
for the Pen, and it is where the orcs administer the
concoctions sent to them by Vilree. The Sculptor has
recently begun using the tools and reagents here to
work on experiments of his own; Vilree is unaware
of this. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.402,r=0.890,b=0.493), with ID 6223e43a-a984-4698-9713-9e93588524eb -->

**Creatures:** There are a pair of orcs here, brothers who assist the Sculptor, watching over the cauldrons and reactions as they slowly simmer and bubble. They are near the workbenches when the PCs enter, but they promptly howl in rage and attack. In addition to using the alchemical weapons they have on them, the orcs favor grabbing random vials off the tables and throwing them at the PCs (see Hazards below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.496,r=0.890,b=0.617), with ID f74eeaca-ee3f-4e60-9d7a-402625f54b84 -->

**Hazards:** The tables are covered with actively cooking reagents, half-finished alchemical items, and other dangerous equipment. If left unattended for ten minutes, the cooking reagents can start a fire in the laboratory; the orc alchemists also know how to intentionally use this equipment for dangerous ends. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.171,r=0.452,b=0.264), with ID b8538c70-5557-405a-9afd-c29a685efd1e -->

A creature adjacent to a table can grab an item from it as an action and use a second action to throw or otherwise use it. Roll on the Random Alchemy table to determine what was grabbed. If a character first takes the Seek action and succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check, they can roughly identify the items before grabbing one, allowing them to roll twice on the Random Alchemy table and choose the preferred result. The orc alchemists always roll twice, taking whatever result you prefer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.265,r=0.452,b=0.418), with ID d4caa069-25cb-48a0-93fd-c4385af7a791 -->

A character can Shove over a table or cauldron, requiring a successful DC 15 Athletics check. This causes everything on the table or in that cauldron to be ruined, posing a risk to anyone who might be hit by an explosive concoction. If a table is pushed over toward a creature, all creatures adjacent to that edge of the table are hit by a number of alchemical experiments, with a DC 18 Reflex saving throw determining the number: a critical success avoids them all, a success indicates the character is hit by one experiment, a failure indicates the character is hit by two, and a character who gets a critical failure is hit by three. Roll each experiment on the Random Alchemy table. Once a table has been knocked over, no one can grab a random experiment from it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.586,r=0.452,b=0.830), with ID a742a45c-c5d2-4010-b541-e2dfc69bad2f -->

If a cauldron is overturned, roll on the Random
Alchemy table to determine what was in the cauldron,
and any creature in the square the cauldron was
emptied into takes triple the effects of the alchemical
item that was rolled (the effect can’t be tripled in the
case of a tanglefoot bag). The character may attempt
a DC 18 basic Reflex save, but this save should be <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.833,r=0.452,b=0.939), with ID 99571bad-3606-41f8-96f2-07a9d907b306 -->

rolled before the contents of the cauldron
are revealed and, if the cauldron contained
elixir of life, the Hit Points it heals are reduced
by the saving throw. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.126,r=0.784,b=0.188), with ID 227595b9-768f-4668-9291-7be554d9fbc3 -->

Rewards: In addition to any gear the PCs might salvage from the alchemists, there are a few other things here they might recover. For each table that was not knocked over, roll twice on the Random Alchemy table. Those items can be taken as long as someone succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check to finish them (roll for each item). There is also 20 gp worth of alchemical reagents here that an alchemist can use to craft additional items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.189,r=0.818,b=0.326), with ID 6973a181-3dfa-4303-b529-c6d2f2f9d7d6 -->

H5. STORAGE CAVE  
This area is used primarily for storage of alchemical gear and reagents. Anyone can tell that most of the barrels and crates are quite old, but the gear and equipment in the laboratory is of the same style and make and looks as if it may have once been stored here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.338,r=0.818,b=0.447), with ID 3156d00d-8cce-4e69-85a4-067a9a793bea -->

In fact, Vilree left all this behind when she
moved to Spite’s Cradle years ago. The Sculptor
and his assistants began to experiment with the
gear six months ago and set up the laboratory to
make elixirs, bombs, and other alchemical tools. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.449,r=0.817,b=0.525), with ID 407149a0-1f4b-46a1-9781-70d56ad5ea45 -->

The equipment here is old but quite valuable to
the right buyer. If the PCs returned with a wagon,
they could load it all up and sell it. The ultimate
value is up to you, but it should be no more than
about 100 gp, and the PCs would have to travel to
Almas or another large city to find such a wealthy
buyer. Alternatively, they could sell it all to Delma or
Tamli for one quarter its value. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.526,r=0.817,b=0.648), with ID 2a89fe0f-b051-4623-986e-b3d8a65e0794 -->

**H6. REFUSE PIT**  
The door from the laboratory into this area is secured with a simple wooden bar on the laboratory side. There is also a secret door leading into the chamber from the lair of the Sculptor (area **H7**). That door is hidden from both sides and can be found only by searching that square and succeeding at a DC 22 Perception check. The cavern is strewn with refuse such as bones and broken equipment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.660,r=0.818,b=0.800), with ID a2b92304-9566-4f12-955c-b8bc5259352b -->

**Rewards:** Scattered among the bones are a few trinkets, including a low-grade cold iron dagger, a _wolf fang_ talisman, and 8 gp in miscellaneous coins. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.802,r=0.818,b=0.847), with ID bfe11cda-3bae-45f6-828b-4a87631c7ac5 -->

H7. LAIR OF THE SCULPTOR                High 2
The northernmost passageway that exits the laboratory ends in a set of stairs that leads up to a massive double door to the west. Made from stout wood and bound with iron, the pair of doors is <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.860,r=0.818,b=0.939), with ID 554d0255-16cf-49a0-8aab-84af9f6ead53 -->

crudely decorated with a carving of a small rural
village that has been set ablaze. Anyone examining
the carving can tell it must have been made many
years ago and, despite its poor overall artistry, the
village bears an unmistakable resemblance to Etran’s
Folly. The doors are not locked. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.525,b=0.218), with ID dc1670c3-b412-47ed-b2f1-3c016a53bc52 -->

This chamber is the lair of the Sculptor, the orc who runs the Pen. When he and the other orcs were asked to hold this place by Vilree several years ago, they initially resented the duty and preferred to stay with the war band. Over time, however, the orcs have come to appreciate their freedom here and enjoy the experiments they are asked to perform. The leader, in particular, became interested in alchemy and took on the nickname “the Sculptor” in the hope he might one day impress Vilree with his talents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.219,r=0.526,b=0.372), with ID 00452c7c-76ad-4d59-ab91-d411f0b5c570 -->

Creature: There is a very good chance the Sculptor heard the fight through the door and knows the PCs are coming. If this is the case, he is standing by the door to area H8 when the PCs enter, prepared to open it the moment they arrive and flee to the blood ooze, hoping to use his final experiment to stop them. In any case, he tries not to fight in this room, using alchemy and whatever minions he has available to slow the PCs down while he escapes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.372,r=0.484,b=0.618), with ID 5ad819b8-fabb-4328-af74-c71a0d7409ec -->

The Sculptor is a canny foe who will stay in the fight so long as it goes his way, but he will attempt to flee when he thinks he’s losing. If he unleashes the blood ooze (area **H8**) against the PCs, he stays in the fight as long as his minions take the brunt of the PCs’ damage; harrying the PCs with bombs whenever he can. When out of options, he attempts to flee the Pen, leaving through the refuse pit, through the laboratory, past the cages, and out into the wilderness. If he is reduced to half Hit Points or fewer, he does not escape; Noala spots him as he flees and hunts him down. If the Sculptor has more than half his Hit Points remaining, he wounds Noala with alchemist’s fire and traps her with a tanglefoot bag to allow his escape. Should this happen, he flees to Vilree and can be found somewhere in Spite’s Cradle later on (likely in a laboratory).

**Rewards:** In addition to the gear and items carried by the Sculptor, there are a few other critical things to be discovered in this room. A small stash of coins worth 18 gp and a fine set of silver scales worth 30 gp sit atop the desk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.618,t=0.602,r=0.893,b=0.693), with ID ab4cbf8c-ee12-4d87-97e6-50554ae8528c -->

This room also contains a trove
of valuable information about what
Vilree was hoping to accomplish here.
Most of the texts are written in Orc,
as they are the Sculptor’s notes on
the various experiments he has been
asked to perform over the past few
months. Almost all of these involve
evolving permanent mutations in
creatures by exposing them to energy
mutagens (see Rules and Rewards on
page 56 for more information). While
many of these experiments were
ultimately successful, they had an
unintended side effect: the creatures
became far too bestial and unreliable <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.631,t=0.694,r=0.894,b=0.941), with ID d4fc72bf-f50c-4c1d-a639-c1baa65de423 -->

to use as minions. About 2 months ago, something
changed, and Vilree stopped asking him to perform
experiments without offering an explanation. The
Sculptor took it upon himself to continue the work,
with varied and unpredictable results, and a number
of creatures escaped. One of the most recent notes
says, “The coagulant thing is finally taking shape. It
might not be what she asked for, but she is sure to be
impressed! When it is ready, I will take it to Spite’s
Cradle and show it to the mistress myself.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.126,r=0.456,b=0.279), with ID 04560857-5ddb-448b-9f44-c19a660eb7e8 -->

All of this can be uncovered by spending a few
hours going through the Sculptor’s notes, although
a broad outline of it can be uncovered in an hour
or so with a successful DC 15 Crafting check. Any
character that examines the notes should be allowed
a DC 18 Perception check to notice an unusual
entry: about 3 years ago, Vilree commanded the orcs
to capture a human. This person was placed in a
covered pit in the woods and exposed to something
that the Sculptor refers to as the viridian vapor. The
last note on this experiment reads, “The human died
in agony in less than a day. We burned his body and
filled in the pit as instructed.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.280,r=0.456,b=0.479), with ID 1ab5d8fc-656c-438d-b828-961c63ce7b99 -->

H8. THE TRUE EXPERIMENT        MODERATE 2
From the moment the door to this area is opened, whimpering moans can be heard from the center of the chamber, where a human man is strapped to a large rack. His flesh is missing in places, replaced with large glass and metal cauldrons that seem to be extracting blood from him, mixing that blood with reagents to transform it, then pumping the blood back into the poor man. Around the room, the PCs can see shackles mounted to the wall where previous prisoners must have spent their final moments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.520,r=0.456,b=0.693), with ID cc66fbd5-b441-4cf6-b9ca-ef1fd32aabe6 -->

**Creature:** The danger here is a newly created blood ooze that the Sculptor made by extracting the blood from several humanoids and mixing it with a soup of alchemical reagents. The ooze is currently inside the human prisoner, where it is being fed by blood that is drained from the human’s body, transformed, then pumped back in. While the Sculptor knows how to keep the ooze docile using a spray of caustic agents he keeps on a table just inside the room, anyone else that approaches the body causes the ooze to burst from its human enclosure and attack, desperately hungry for more blood. If the Sculptor has fled here, he unleashes the blood ooze, using a powdered blood coagulant in his pouch to drive the ooze toward the PCs (he can try three times before running out).

The victim in this chamber is far too gone to be saved, especially since the blood ooze takes the last of his blood as it departs his body. He was a farmer named Pindro from the outskirts of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.263,r=0.820,b=0.325), with ID f3e4a0c5-db10-49a8-b72a-ca2f52b0a111 -->

There is little to be learned in this chamber, with one vital exception: an old set of delivery instructions is pinned to the north wall of the room, placed there to help the orcs find their way back to Vilree’s lair in the hills to the west. They have not needed it in some time, but to the PCs it is invaluable, as it includes directions to Spite’s Cradle from “Hallod’s drop-off stump.” Combined with the map to the stump from Hallod’s hideout, the PCs now have enough information to track down Vilree, the villain behind everything. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.326,r=0.820,b=0.479), with ID f497299e-66c8-4933-9283-2c3c6c53dbde -->

NOALA'S REQUEST  
After dealing with the creatures in the Pen, the PCs can meet up with Noala outside. She prevented a few corrupted animals from escaping, but she says they were nothing too serious (unless the Sculptor escaped, as noted in area H7). In any event, she is far more interested in learning what happened to the PCs inside the blight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.549,r=0.813,b=0.678), with ID 8bd2c226-df0e-43b9-8987-6295d75b030e -->

The PCs’ tale greatly disturbs Noala, but she is
relieved to hear the orcs will be conducting no more
experiments in her woods. Unfortunately, Noala
does not believe that this one laboratory could
possibly be responsible for all of the blights she has
located. She suspects that Vilree must be ultimately
responsible, and she implores the PCs to bring the
alchemist to justice “for Bort’s sake, if not for the
sake of the woods.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.678,r=0.819,b=0.816), with ID f0271849-8690-4ba2-9884-23462b55e20b -->

If the PCs ask Noala to accompany them to Spite’s Cradle, she is humbled but ultimately declines, citing that her place is in the woods. Until this threat has been removed, keeping the forest safe is a full-time job. She wishes the PCs well and promises to share some of the secrets of the forest with them through training upon their return (see Noala’s Training in the Rules and Rewards section on page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.816,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID 576fd0fb-9ef7-4e46-ba4b-733128721fa8 -->

Once the PCs have learned the information from the Pen, they likely know that Vilree is the person responsible for not only ordering Bort’s poisoning, but also for the blights near Etran’s Folly and the mutated monsters that have spawned there. The PCs must find Vilree’s lair in the wilderness and bring her to justice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.176,t=0.570,r=0.526,b=0.680), with ID 18718333-6e7d-4d08-9282-7197350ff964 -->

# SPITE’S CRADLE
Some twenty miles west of Etran’s Folly are the foothills at the edge of the Five Kings Mountains. A few years ago, it was here that Vilree found a small war band of orcs living in a complex cave system situated in a narrow limestone valley left behind when a creek dried up long ago. In the depths of these caves, Vilree found crystals and other reagents that would prove invaluable to her research. She used her alchemy to enslave the orcs, killing their chief and installing a more suitable replacement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.688,r=0.526,b=0.862), with ID 9714d039-fae7-418c-9f23-62b67931a7b3 -->

In the years that followed, she turned the caves
into a small fortress where she could practice her
alchemy and plan the ruin of Etran’s Folly. She
named the fortress Spite’s Cradle, as it was here
that she would nurture her hatred for the people <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.862,r=0.526,b=0.940), with ID 85106952-4f0a-4886-9739-2203efea05bd -->

who caused the death of her mother, treated her as
an outcast, and left her to die.
   Now, on the eve of her revenge, the PCs have
discovered her lair. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.572,r=0.893,b=0.632), with ID 4908b1b0-622e-4626-9f7a-f4147ee20e6f -->

The inside of Vilree’s fortress (areas **15–117**) is lit
by sputtering torches. The walls are stone and the
ceilings are about 9 feet high. The orc lair (areas **13**
and **14**) is not lit, and neither are the natural caves
down in the depths (areas **118** and **119**). Vilree’s
innermost sanctum (area **120**) is lit by the glowing
crystal formations that line the cave walls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.633,r=0.893,b=0.740), with ID f582b2a0-af17-4743-90fc-07def5a9854a -->

11. The Gate  
Using the map to the drop point from Hallod’s Hideout and the directions from the Pen, the PCs can easily find Spite’s Cradle. On foot, it takes 7 or 8 hours to reach the place, although if the PCs manage to borrow or buy some horses, they can reduce that time to about 5 hours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.752,r=0.891,b=0.848), with ID 9a11195e-9627-4f1e-afcc-37782fe52e6c -->

The directions from the orc laboratory lead to the foothills far west of Etran’s Folly. Here, nestled in the shadow of the Five Kings Mountains, there are countless small valleys and crevasses, but the directions lead to one particular valley: a place called “Spite’s Cradle.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.862,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID 0420b0cc-5a4e-4419-9b74-d95a81ee3788 -->

*paizo.com, Jarvin Bayona <animaznman@yahoo.com>, May 30, 2025* <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.309,t=0.988,r=0.693,b=1.000), with ID cfd7855d-d5fc-4629-98f7-64af39d31a3f -->

Up ahead, a wooden palisade spans the valley; a gigantic double door set into its center. Beyond this wall, a guard tower is barely visible, although it's difficult to tell whether it is occupied. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.124,r=0.454,b=0.191), with ID 462031b0-30ce-41e1-9c08-7030646538ed -->

The PCs can get past the palisade walls in a variety
of ways, but if the orcs spot them and sound an alarm,
things will get much more difficult inside. The wooden
palisade walls are 15 feet high, and the tops are carved
to points. It’s easy to get a grappling hook onto these
walls, but the guards will quickly spot that. The gate
is barred from the inside using three heavy wooden
beams, each of which can be moved with a successful
DC 15 Athletics check. The cliffs that make up the
sides of the valley are steep and 30 feet high, but
not impossible to scale. Climbing the limestone face
requires at least two successful DC 18 Athletics checks
(one to climb up and another to climb down) and a
successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to move across the
crumbling stone without causing a cascade of debris
the guards are likely to notice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.202,r=0.454,b=0.449), with ID 00668978-11e2-42bd-be97-08da115d1688 -->

The guards in the tower do not have a particularly
good view outside the wall, giving the player characters
an easy approach, but their view of the ground between
the wooden palisades is favorable. The guards generally
look around once every few minutes, and they only
attempt Perception checks against disturbances in the
yard (like a grappling hook or the sudden appearance of
falling rocks). They know they are in a remote location
and don’t expect invasion. PCs that approach from
above have to beat Graytusk’s Perception DC 19 to
approach unnoticed. See area I6 for more information
on what happens if the guards raise the alarm. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.449,r=0.454,b=0.633), with ID 5d7fd396-eb5a-4686-9cf0-79227eff3dad -->

12. GUARDED YARD                        TRIVIAL/LOW 3
Beyond the palisade is a well-trodden yard. A small wooden hut is built against the southern rock wall, facing a squat stone fortress. A guard tower stands at the north end of the edifice while a two-story dome anchors the south. The fortress has a brooding look about it, with narrow windows set between heavy pillars of rock. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.642,r=0.454,b=0.788), with ID 632b044f-7de1-4aea-9a58-08e82806a142 -->

This area is home to the orcs that serve Vilree.

  Creatures: During the day there are usually two orcs out in the yard relaxing or preparing a meal. This number rises to four at night, when the orcs are most active. In any case, they are not expecting a fight. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.800,r=0.453,b=0.877), with ID 340ace6f-8c49-423c-85ac-1d5e34ec0bfd -->

If the alarm has been raised, nine of the 10
orcs are here, including Lord Nar but excluding
Graytusk, who remains in the guard tower. All nine
have their weapons drawn and are ready for battle, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.878,r=0.455,b=0.941), with ID 5611178d-f514-474d-8d94-f1252162591e -->

13. LORD NAR’S THRONE                        LOW 3
A crude leather tarp covers the entrance to this simple wooden hut built against the side of the valley. When the PCs enter, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.245,r=0.819,b=0.313), with ID 79953d13-4a09-4a22-8d59-819e62939731 -->

In the center of this wooden hut is a massive stone throne. Crudely carved with howling orc faces, the chair is clearly intended to intimidate. Flanking it on the walls of the hut are two massive leather canvases featuring simplistic paintings. On the left is an image of a mountain peak with an orc head howling up at it from a great cavern at the mountain’s heart. On the right is the image of a tall, slender woman with black hair. Her ears suggest she is elven or half-elven. In one hand, she holds a large beaker overflowing with green liquid; in the other, she holds naked fire. At the back wall, you can make out a curtain partly concealing an opening into the cliff face. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.323,r=0.819,b=0.512), with ID a7ce385f-b1ec-49a0-8353-e604279154f8 -->

This hut and the caves behind it are the lair of the
orcs serving under Vilree’s command; their leader is
Lord Nar, a large, brutish orc. If the alarm has not
been raised, Nar will be seated here on his throne.
He sleeps on it in the mornings and into the early
afternoon, but he is awake all night, venturing
outside only for food or to relieve himself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.523,r=0.819,b=0.632), with ID 08b8354d-fcc9-4387-ada6-67b642de0e5a -->

Lord Nar was made the ruler of the orcs shortly
after Vilree took command of the war band. The
ceremony is still talked about in hushed whispers by
the surviving orcs. The previous chief was asked if he
would submit and, when he refused, Vilree burned
him alive using her powerful alchemy. When the
question was posed again, this time to Nar, he readily
agreed. In the years since, Vilree has addicted all of
the orcs to a mild sedative that makes them easier to
manipulate; if the PCs drink from any of the water
sources here or in the caves, they will taste something
odd, but it takes weeks of constant exposure for this
sedative to have any lasting effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.632,r=0.819,b=0.832), with ID 6b98d85b-39c2-43a3-a9a2-e50ac5280aef -->

**Creature:** Nar is a corpulent orc, having grown fat off the luxury of being Vilree’s chosen. While the other orcs resent him, they are too afraid of Vilree’s power to test her decisions. Nar, for his part, plays up the importance of his role in the war band. He visits Vilree once a week to update her, and while these meetings are usually dull except for the occasional order, Nar likes <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.832,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID f4353240-b6a0-490b-8f95-42e3b7676cf9 -->

to pretend that she is taking his counsel. If threatened
by the heroes, Nar explains that harming him will
incur the lady’s wrath and that the PCs had best just
surrender to him if they know what is good for them.

PCs and calling on all his orcs to do the same. The

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of strength and primal authority, fitting for a character named "Lord Nar."
  • The use of animal pelts and a large club suggests a tribal or barbaric archetype.
  • The detailed textures and earthy colors enhance the impression of a rugged, wilderness-dwelling figure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.001,t=0.378,r=0.546,b=0.952), with ID d0d9b2d6-f024-4ca7-b860-318824abf07a -->

Rage ◆ Lord Nar flies into a rage that lasts 1 minute and grants him 8 temporary Hit Points, 4 additional damage with his listed attacks, and a –1 penalty to AC. He cannot use actions that have the concentrate trait while raging, unless they also have the rage trait. Once his rage ends, Nar cannot Rage again for 1 minute. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.341,r=0.887,b=0.434), with ID ad80a034-5a00-482e-9784-16b85f60aa86 -->

Rewards: A bronze key hangs from a leather cord around Nar’s neck; this unlocks the doors to Spite’s Cradle in area I5. Set into the seat of Nar’s throne is a hidden compartment containing the war band’s riches. It can be opened by simultaneously pressing a pair of buttons disguised as orc eyes in the throne’s decorative carving. Inside the compartment is a bag containing 28 gp in silver and copper pieces, a flawed sapphire worth 20 gp, a scroll of heal (2nd level), a scroll of sound burst, and a scroll of restoration. The scrolls belonged to the war band’s shaman, who tried to leave soon after Vilree arrived but, unbeknownst to Nar, Vilree captured her and used her to create the Amalgam (see area I16). Finally, the compartment contains a tiny straw doll made to look like Vilree that Nar keeps here to practice talking to his mistress. It even has hairs collected from her comb that he has lovingly placed on its head. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.449,r=0.892,b=0.755), with ID e7fd7b58-c69c-49da-9fa0-a25b52458470 -->

14. SLEEPING CAVES                LOW/MODERATE 3

The cave opening reveals a connected pair of cramped chambers that stink of sweat and campfire smoke. The floor is covered in debris and piles of filth. Almost a dozen sleeping mats are nestled in nooks and built into the walls throughout this space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.766,r=0.891,b=0.879), with ID 6e841358-f16a-4a40-a1c3-a5e553df8c86 -->

The orcs use these two caves as their home; unless the alarm has been raised, this chamber usually has a few orcs in it at all times. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.892,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID d03d5f05-d688-4d51-93b2-fc7b9b6342cf -->

**Creatures:** A total of eight orcs sleep in these chambers, although there is space for almost a dozen. Most of the bedrolls on the map actually indicate two nooks, one above and one below, both with sleeping mats and personal effects. During the day, there are usually five orcs here, with two in the yard and one more up in the tower with Graytusk. At night the number drops to just three, with four in the yard and a different orc up in the tower with Graytusk. If a fight breaks out in area 14, the orcs here will come to investigate during the second round of combat, using the first round to gather their weapons, entering the throne room singly or in pairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.327), with ID 0ae57fab-ea10-4559-b10a-778f9fcd4faf -->

**Rewards:** The orcs do not have much of value, but there are a few things of interest to be found here. Scattered among the nooks is 37 sp, 52 cp, and a lot of damaged or shoddy common items (such as ropes, whetstones, backpacks, and candles). If the PCs are looking for something in particular, there is a 50% chance they can find it so long as the item is not magical and has a value of 5 sp or less. Anyone searching the caves can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to find a small cache located under a rock beneath a bedroll. This cache contains an *invisibility potion* and a silver key (worth 1 gp) that unlocks the door to area **I8**. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.402,r=0.454,b=0.588), with ID 9d556f4d-71be-4621-a171-079b3f5a6554 -->

15. Reception Hall                        Moderate 3
The large double door leading into Spite’s Cradle are made from heavy wooden planks reinforced with iron bands. They are locked from the inside with an average quality lock, but can be opened with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks or by using the bronze key that Lord Nar wears around his neck. The doors are emblazoned with the image of a small village in flames. This is clearly based on the image on the doors leading to the Sculptor’s chambers in the Pen, but it is more refined and was made by a more practiced hand.

Once the PCs find a way inside, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.598,r=0.454,b=0.802), with ID d318c913-13cc-49dd-961c-728143fda4f7 -->

The doors swing wide to reveal a small reception hall. A worn carpet stretches from the doors to another double door across the way. To the right is a curved wall with a map of the nearby area painted on it. Spite’s Cradle is in the center, with lines drawn to all of the nearby major settlements and noting travel times by horse. Where Etran’s Folly should be, there is only a simple legend that reads “Ruins of Plaguestone.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.814,r=0.454,b=0.943), with ID 7978c5b6-cd94-46dd-944b-b2a1cf249ea0 -->

The map gives only the broadest
implication of Vilree’s plans. After
destroying Etran’s Folly, she plans to slowly
build a web of domination over the region using
alchemical drugs and coercion to establish a
hidden empire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.125,r=0.784,b=0.218), with ID 43a795b3-1215-4ecd-afd6-b0702fd9bcff -->

**Creatures:** Two years ago, when Vilree was first experimenting with energy mutagens, she paid a hedge mage to bind a pair of minor air elementals to her service so that she could learn more about the elemental forces. After her research took her elsewhere, she placed the elementals here to serve as guardians, ordering them to attack anyone who enters the room who does not belong. Once the PCs enter, the wind suddenly picks up as the elemental takes shape and attacks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.220,r=0.820,b=0.374), with ID 7fd34256-83f0-40d4-803c-4d6d78afb3fa -->

16. GUARD TOWER                                    LOW 3  
This tower actually consists of two locations: the  
tower’s interior and its covered rooftop. The area  
shown on the map is the interior. The rooftop area’s  
only noteworthy features are a hatch granting access  
to the tower interior via a ladder and a bucket with  
100 arrows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.443,r=0.822,b=0.555), with ID e027c727-d438-41a8-b5ea-d17b81314620 -->

**Creatures:** There are always two orcs in this location. One is an ordinary guard, from among those who dwell with Lord Nar. The other is Graytusk, the only capable hunter and tracker among the orcs. Unless she is out on the hunt, Graytusk spends all her time in the tower, either watching from the rooftop or getting a few hours of sleep in the interior room. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.556,r=0.821,b=0.678), with ID aa382d73-5bb6-4f16-8cec-1ac8c4d5140f -->

As noted in area 11, the primary job of the orcs here
is to watch the yard. The orcs attempt Perception
checks against anyone in the yard every few minutes,
increasing to every round if there is a disturbance
(such as falling rocks or a grappling hook thrown
over the wall). If the orcs spot anything, their first
action is to sound an alarm, alerting Nar and the
other orcs that there’s trouble. Within a few rounds,
all of the orcs are roused and in the yard. They
remain this way for at least 30 minutes while they
try to figure out what’s going on. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.678,r=0.820,b=0.847), with ID 2ba7bf7d-fcad-4aeb-b442-c6100dbf1b80 -->

In combat, the orc brute descends to area 12 using the stairs on the side of the tower. Graytusk stays here on the rooftop area, raining down arrows upon any intruder she sees. With 40 arrows in her quiver and 100 arrows in the bucket, she’ll be able to sustain that routine for quite a while. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.848,r=0.820,b=0.940), with ID cecdbdf9-b48d-4692-bb83-ce8f4d714099 -->

This chamber is a small study. To the north, a staircase ascends to a double door; to the south, a stone door is set into the curved wall of the fortresses’ structure.

that includes all of Vilree’s business dealings over
the years, including all of the deals with Bort. While
most of these dealings were ordinary in nature,
she did place orders for large amounts of certain
reagents. In the past year in particular, her orders
got larger and larger, including a number of vile-
sounding reagents such as corpse blood, essence
of bile, and fester root. Anyone who succeeds at a
DC 18 Crafting check can identify these as reagents
used in poisons and diseases. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.279), with ID 2edcb1b0-eba1-4a7d-af56-598731ce3d76 -->

servants. While successful, the experiment
proved too costly and time consuming to be

Summary : This is an illustration of a small, bat-like creature named Pergy, depicted holding a wooden spoon, accompanied by descriptive text detailing its behavior in a role-playing game scenario.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a small, round, bat-winged creature (Pergy) holding a large wooden spoon.
  • The creature is rendered in a cartoonish style, with a focus on its wings and utensil.
  • The background is plain, with the illustration integrated into a block of text.
  • The text describes Pergy's actions when surprised by player characters (PCs) in a kitchen setting.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration is in color, with soft shading and a whimsical tone.
  • The text provides game mechanics: Pergy throws hot soup at the nearest PC (+3 to attack, 1 bludgeoning and 1d4 fire damage), then attempts to flee and alert another character named Vilree.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Pergy is positioned on the left side of the image, facing right, with its wings partially extended.
  • The wooden spoon is held in the foreground, emphasizing its role in the described action.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually supports the narrative text, helping players or game masters imagine the encounter.
  • The creature's comical and non-threatening appearance contrasts with its described defensive actions, adding a whimsical element to the scenario. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.219,r=0.821,b=0.449), with ID 2c0df6a8-8c1b-4aa1-a47c-1e81f042e2c1 -->

There are a
handful of diaries
here from when Vilree
was young; they detail
the years after her mother,
Silwyth’s, death, when she tried
to survive in a town that shunned
her. The diaries end on the five-year
anniversary of Silwyth’s death,
when Vilree decided to leave
the town. She mentions that she found
a new place to live and learn about her
mother’s work: a series of caves
deep in the forest north of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.282,r=0.376,b=0.493), with ID 568ed5e9-3ff9-4411-adb1-76d49373932f -->

If the characters spend  
any time going through the  
personal belongings, they  
undoubtedly hear a racket  
coming from the kitchen (area  
19); the noise is made by Vilree’s  
homunculus as it attempts to cook.

**Rewards:** Among the curios and mementos on the shelves is a silver locket that contains a small painting of young Vilree. The locket is worth 5 gp. In addition, there is a _hand of the mage_ on one of the shelves, grasping a vial of lesser bravo’s brew. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.603,r=0.453,b=0.678), with ID 549d1211-64e4-4e94-a950-19682e885f4a -->

19. KITCHEN

Dirty pots and pans are piled high on the table in the center of this room, obscuring the view of the fireplace that sits beyond. Something in this kitchen is making a terrible racket; it sounds like a wooden spoon clattering against an iron pot. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.691,r=0.451,b=0.802), with ID 1aa9008d-c399-4023-b1d1-dd527135c858 -->

This kitchen is where Vilree prepares meals, but when she is busy, she allows her homunculus servant to attempt to cook. Unfortunately, the homunculus is a terrible cook, rarely making anything remotely edible. There is not much of value, but the PCs can get food and a wide variety of exotic spices worth a total of 2 gp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.817,r=0.451,b=0.922), with ID ea9b23c8-6053-4929-a4d0-4c42587f34ff -->

110. THE LADY’S HALL  
The stairs ascend to a small hall that leads to Vilree’s personal chambers. The curved wall of the fortress here is covered in paintings of Vilree’s mother, Silwyth, painted by Vilree to remind herself of all that she has lost. The paintings depict an elven woman of unnatural beauty, with raven hair, fully green eyes, and a mischievous smile dancing across her lips. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.478,t=0.522,r=0.818,b=0.662), with ID 69511c50-29e9-4ea2-bef8-c5f7cea3cbbe -->

The door leading into Vilree’s chambers is both
trapped and locked. It can be opened with the key
Vilree keeps on her person or with three successful DC
20 Thievery skill checks. Opening the door without
using the key triggers the trap (see Hazard below). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.664,r=0.818,b=0.739), with ID eee53210-be87-4d0c-b195-d9b78ab1c132 -->

Hazard: Vilree has created a dangerous trap in this area to punish anyone foolish enough to violate her private sanctum. If anyone tries to open the door without first using the key, small compartments open in the ceiling, drenching the room with a freezing alchemical solution. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.741,r=0.818,b=0.831), with ID b85efe96-4723-48e5-8b85-b6218b90480b -->

11. Vilree’s Chambers

The doors open to reveal a bedchamber with a large bed opposite the door, flanked by a desk and a dresser. The heady scent of lilac hangs heavy in the air, emanating from a cone of incense that is still smoking faintly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.275,r=0.525,b=0.375), with ID 2ff39deb-925b-4c6a-ba41-3d62d831f221 -->

Vilree uses this chamber as her sleeping quarters,  
but she hasn’t used it much over the past few weeks.  
It contains her bed, a dresser filled with robes and  
work aprons, a desk filled with personal effects and  
correspondence, and a chest (detailed in Rewards  
below). A door in the corner leads to the privy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.386,r=0.525,b=0.479), with ID 707798b2-040d-41ad-9ec2-238a9d788f92 -->

If the PCs spend at least 10 minutes looking
through the correspondence, they find Hallod’s
letters confirming the delivery of various shipments
of alchemical reagents. Another piece of parchment
contains a timeline of dates and notable occurrences;
near the bottom, it shows the date that Bort’s caravan
arrived in town with the note “Tied up loose end:
merchant.” There are two entries beneath that line:
one is dated yesterday, and reads, “The last reaction is
in place.” The final entry does not have a date listed—
that spot is blank—but it reads, “Mother avenged.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.479,r=0.524,b=0.647), with ID 506acf01-6b19-48d2-baec-6174ad5f03c9 -->

**Rewards:** While the clothes in the dresser are of good make, they are not particularly valuable. One of the drawers contains a mistform elixir and two lesser elixirs of life. The chest in the corner is closed but not locked. Inside are three sacks containing a large amount of coin (53 gp, 86 sp, 416 cp) Vilree earned selling alchemical elixirs to merchants over the years. There are also four moderate alchemist’s fire, two lesser tanglefoot bags, and a moderate fire energy mutagen (page 56). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.648,r=0.525,b=0.802), with ID 20458bc9-c6af-4d33-8f63-c7888db58376 -->

112. SILWYTH’S SHRINE                MODERATE 3

Standing at one end of this long chamber is a marble statue of an elven woman holding a flask. She is dressed in a flowing gown, and liquid tears streak down her cheeks into a small pool surrounding the statue’s base. Other than the faint burbling of water, this chamber is peaceful and still. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.812,r=0.525,b=0.942), with ID d45da8a7-c1cc-4c1e-9533-34012c792c7b -->

Years after building a home here, Vilree hired an
artisan in Almas to sculpt a statue of her mother.
She had it shipped in secret and installed in this
room so Vilree would have a place where she could
go and remember the woman who tried to save the
folk of Etran’s Folly, was branded a witch, and cast
out. The statue serves as both a reminder and a
warning: never count on others for aid. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.891,b=0.248), with ID 0e4349ac-b284-4728-b641-bda9bb3cf863 -->

At the bottom of the pool is a sealed stone box that
bears the alchemical symbol for life alongside Silwyth’s
name. The box contains her remains, which Vilree
brought here shortly after the shrine was completed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.249,r=0.891,b=0.310), with ID 73015a95-f394-4a06-9c59-01b4ccecfb72 -->

**Creatures:** The pool and fountain in this room are powered by a pair of brine sharks that Vilree bound years ago. These elementals live in the pool and come out only if someone other than Vilree tries to approach the statue, whereupon the pool suddenly surges onto the ground as the elementals take form and attack. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.312,r=0.891,b=0.402), with ID 9cfeb6f0-6cfd-41d6-af0e-3a36d0032948 -->

113. Storage  
This chamber is piled high with boxes, barrels, and crates. While most are partially empty, they do contain a wide variety of alchemical tools, reagents, and supplies that could be used to create a vast array of alchemical items. If the PCs could find a way to transport all of this, the reagents alone would allow for the creation of 50 gp worth of alchemical items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.476,r=0.890,b=0.602), with ID 0ee34258-75d9-4712-b2fc-480a3a8b5a1a -->

I14. MAIN LABORATORY                              SEVERE 3

The doors open into a long chamber packed full of alchemical gear and experiments. Cauldrons stand next to tables where even now volatile mixtures are brewing and bubbling. A large furnace is opposite the door, just behind a long pool of water with a statue of a woman standing at its head. To the east, a passageway reveals a set of descending spiral stairs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.614,r=0.890,b=0.754), with ID 5851c745-f3e0-4596-ba91-714d578dbf8a -->

This is the laboratory where Vilree does most of the
work that funds her nefarious plans. It is here that
she makes all sorts of elixirs, tools, and bombs to be
sold in Andoran, Cheliax, Isger, and beyond. After
all, her ambitions far outpace those of an ordinary
practitioner of alchemy. Vilree plans to make a name
for herself, to create the legend that her mother never
had—and legends cost gold. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.770,r=0.890,b=0.892), with ID 0ac42525-4683-4a6e-af3c-7f25be30d444 -->

PCs arrive, but the flasks are still carefully filtering
reagents and are far from ready. The furnace is lit
and is being used to melt copper, burning away
impurities for a future experiment. Finally, the pool
is used as a fresh water supply and is drawn from
a well upstream from the spot where Vilree dumps
waste into the depths. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.126,r=0.453,b=0.234), with ID 8f335484-2237-477f-91c0-985755d7f16c -->

The statue standing over the pool is of Vilree; she
stands in the same pose as her mother in area 112,
only she does not have tears streaming down her
cheeks. Instead, her expression is hard, cold, and
calculating. The stairs to the east descend to area 115. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.235,r=0.452,b=0.310), with ID b969910c-461c-40dd-9083-4d02c424c1c2 -->

Creatures: Vilree long ago realized that she couldn’t trust anyone with her most delicate work. Orcs might be good for testing mutagens and holding prisoners, but they lack the common sense and caution necessary to work in a laboratory. To this end, she experimented to create larger, smarter, and more capable alchemical servants. After a year of research, the first alchemical drudge was created. Appearing like large, wingless homonculi, four such creatures occupy this laboratory, overseeing basic tasks like tending an ongoing experiment or keeping the place tidy. They have strict orders to attack anyone who enters unaccompanied by Vilree. Each is loaded with a different bomb type for its alchemical strike, dealing acid, cold, fire, and electricity respectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.311,r=0.452,b=0.540), with ID 09467c76-e2f3-4894-af8b-ee08dee960cd -->

Empathy Link (arcane, divination, mental) An alchemical drudge can’t speak, but its mind is linked to its creator. It can share basic emotional information with its creator, such as fear, happiness, or anger. If the drudge is destroyed, its master automatically knows this.

15. Gallery

The spiral stairs from the laboratory descend fifty feet before ending in a narrow hallway. To one side, more stairs descend further to an iron door, while the hallway continues south to a simple wooden door.

The stairs descend to Vilree’s holding pen (area 116), where she brings prisoners and test subjects for delicate experiments. The door to the pen is barred from this side.

Screeching open on rusted hinges, the door opens to a room that is quite large, with a ceiling twenty feet above. The north side of the room is divided into three cells by iron bars. To the south is a high platform overlooking the cells. Two of the cells are empty, while the third contains a pitiful mass, huddled in the corner even though its cell door is open. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.690,r=0.819,b=0.831), with ID 08bc30d5-354d-4caa-b9e3-fdc6b91df09e -->

This chamber is used by Vilree to hold subjects for her experiments. The platform is for observing prisoners from above, and it connects to area 117 via a passageway. The cells contain piles of sweat-soaked straw, scraps of fur, a few scales, and other signs that creatures have been held here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.847,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID 67a5dfa4-5baf-47db-ae50-8c0b9e93e7db -->

**Creature:** Successful experiments are sent out to be used by other minions, but failures are fused into a horrible, pitiful thing known only as the Amalgam and which functions as the jailor here. Vilree captured the orc war band’s shaman as she tried to escape, and then used a powerful mutagenic extract to fuse the poor orc with a hobgoblin. Today, the Amalgam is made up of over a dozen creatures and is recognizable only as a mass of flesh and limbs. In nightmarish pain, the Amalgam’s only release is to obey Vilree, who occasionally gives the thing a painkilling elixir. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.127,r=0.526,b=0.296), with ID 2b0953e6-b45e-40a3-b576-0a3c9b25288c -->

The Amalgam does not notice the PCs until they

Summary : This is a detailed fantasy illustration of a monstrous creature called "The Amalgam," accompanied by descriptive text about an alchemical laboratory setting from a roleplaying game supplement.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a grotesque, multi-limbed creature named "The Amalgam."
  • The creature has at least six visible arms, with a mix of humanoid and monstrous features, and a partially exposed, raw, red musculature.
  • It wears tattered, dark cloth over its torso and has a partially skeletal, monstrous face.
  • The background is minimal, with some greenish plant elements on the left and a faint laboratory setting implied by the text.
  • The color palette is dominated by muted greens, reds, and purples, emphasizing a horror or alchemical theme.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference is present.
  • The illustration is digital, with high detail and shading to emphasize the creature's unnatural anatomy.
  • The label "The Amalgam" is overlaid near the creature's feet in a stylized font.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature is centered and dominates the composition, with its limbs splayed outward, filling most of the frame.
  • The background is largely white or empty, focusing attention on the creature.
  • The text is arranged around the illustration, with a block of green-highlighted descriptive text to the right and a narrative box below.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually communicates the unnatural, horrific nature of "The Amalgam," likely a product of alchemical experimentation as described in the accompanying text.
  • The multiple limbs and exposed musculature reinforce the theme of mutation and unnatural science.
  • The overall effect is to evoke a sense of dread and curiosity, fitting the context of a fantasy roleplaying game encounter. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.006,t=0.393,r=0.895,b=0.960), with ID e581d46d-bde5-4496-8ed5-e2ebfece03ec -->

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated table of contents for an adventure module, presented within a fantasy-themed border featuring magical elements.

illustration:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a vertically oriented, ornate frame with a magical, alchemical theme, including swirling purple and green shapes, a glowing orb at the top, and a potion flask.
  • The interior contains a parchment-like area listing the adventure's sections.
  • The color palette is dominated by purples, greens, and golds, with star-like sparkles for a magical effect.
Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The text is legible and centered within the parchment area.
  • The following sections are listed:
    – Part 1: A Mysterious Murder
    – Part 2: The Ranger’s Request
    – Part 3: Into Vilree’s Lair
    – Adventure Toolbox
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The decorative frame surrounds the text, with magical elements concentrated at the top and bottom.
  • The text is vertically stacked and evenly spaced within the central parchment.
Analysis : 
  • The illustration is designed to evoke a sense of fantasy and magic, setting the tone for the adventure content. The structure clearly organizes the module into three narrative parts and a toolbox section, with visual emphasis on the magical theme. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.788,t=0.093,r=1.004,b=0.766), with ID 6c68db0a-cb8b-41eb-a614-6f3db5e9c992 -->

Vilree left the room while creating two doses of energy mutagen (page 56). Her formula book is open on the central table next to the bubbling concoction (see Rewards below). This project takes up only a small corner of the large table, which is otherwise empty. The alchemy tools here are all tainted with an oily green residue. By consulting the formula book and inspecting the available ingredients, a PC can attempt a DC 22 Crafting check to identify this residue as a side effect of the viridian vapor. The book describes an absolutely lethal disease contracted by inhaling the vapor. The disease causes a horrific fungus to grow in the lungs within hours, leading to death. The books do not describe a cure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.125,r=0.455,b=0.341), with ID 87f4ef88-ba63-4f4a-99c0-457686ea574a -->

Clever PCs might compare the ingredients and
reagents that Bort supplied with the formulas in the
book. It takes 10 minutes to find the right information,
but one thing becomes abundantly clear: Vilree had
enough ingredients to create 500 batches of viridian
vapor. Worse, none of those ingredients can be found
here in the laboratory in any quantity, although there
are a number of empty containers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.342,r=0.454,b=0.464), with ID a39aba91-dc8b-4d86-bab0-eea8efb49d50 -->

A parchment tucked inside the formula book bears a simple diagram of a round, flat-topped rock with a depression on top. The diagram depicts a procedure for using acid to create a reservoir inside the stone. There is only one note on the illustration, reading “Mother’s ring will be the key.” The PCs may not realize it at first, but this diagram depicts the plaguestone in the center of Etran’s Folly. Over the past few months, Vilree has hollowed out the stone and secretly filled it with viridian vapor. Her plan is to destroy the stone using her mother’s ring, which she has had enchanted to explosively shatter the stone when it comes into contact with the ring. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.465,r=0.453,b=0.678), with ID 54f73246-6ad2-42f5-b84c-6ebd10581271 -->

The tall glass cylinder at the west end of the room contains the remains of a dwarf, Vilree’s most recent test subject. To ensure the viridian vapor was suitably lethal, she had her orcs venture deep into the mountains and capture the first humanoid they encountered. The unfortunate dwarf was on his way home from visiting relatives when the orcs set upon him. He died in this chamber a few days later, and his skin split open as the fungus inside him consumed his flesh. Worse still, the vapor is still swirling around his body and his rotting flesh can now transmit the disease. A successful DC 20 Medicine check by a PC who has read Vilree’s formula book confirms that these are effects of the viridian vapor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.679,r=0.452,b=0.892), with ID 4bf4555f-6ae8-4c2c-971e-2f078aa7a4ed -->

Rewards: There are a number of valuable alchemical items in this room. Vilree’s gear could easily be plundered to create a set of alchemist’s tools, and the reagents present are enough to craft 80 gp worth of alchemical items. There are also a number of finished items here: 3 minor elixirs of life, 2 lesser elixirs of life, 2 lesser alchemist’s fire, 4 lesser acid flasks, 2 lesser tanglefoot bags, 2 lesser frost vials, a lesser cognitive mutagen, a lesser stone body mutagen, and a moderate electricity energy mutagen. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.372,r=0.818,b=0.525), with ID 93b77915-7661-4c73-a2f9-7bd0e8913eb4 -->

But the real treasure here is the formula book on the table. It contains a wide variety of formulas, including all of the items found in this adventure (acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bomber’s eye elixir, bottled lightning, bravo’s brew, cat’s eye elixir, elixirs of life, liquid ice, mistform elixir, tanglefoot bags, and of course, the viridian vapor).

The stairs descend into a rough-hewn chamber, the far side of which looks like a natural cave. In the southeast corner, a passageway winds off into darkness. A sputtering torch is mounted next to the door.

These caves are the reason Vilree moved her laboratory here. As the PCs get closer to the cave walls, the character with the highest Perception notices veins of green in the rock. This ore is a key ingredient in the creation of the viridian vapor, and part of the reason it is so deadly. When ground up, the green rock deals serious damage to the lungs, allowing an infection to take hold and grow within hours. If the characters have studied Vilree’s formula book, they know this green rock is called flaystone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.659,r=0.819,b=0.940), with ID 475a7d61-bb3e-4c4c-8bdf-c3bdee416176 -->

The twisting corridor opens into a large cavern filled with large, glistening stalactites and stalagmites. Puddles of brackish water dot the floor, and while the sound of rushing water seems to be close by, the source is not in this room. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.121,r=0.525,b=0.237), with ID 5f8e588e-5baa-4f61-bddd-5526c079b76c -->

This cavern was too cramped for Vilree’s use, but a number of paths have been opened through the chamber, allowing characters to easily move through it.

**Creatures:** Vilree is careful not to make too much noise when passing through this chamber, but the PCs have no idea that the room is inhabited by a large number of bats that swarm at the slightest provocation. The swarm tends to move, use Blood Feast, and then move again, while the giant bat picks a target and attacks until slain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.248,r=0.525,b=0.403), with ID ddc1a9dd-bfae-4695-9c78-9c94aae87388 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a grotesque, monstrous creature labeled "The Behemoth," featuring exaggerated anatomical features and stitched-together body parts.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a large, humanoid monster with oversized hands, a distended belly, and a disproportionately large head.
  • The creature's skin appears pale and fleshy, with numerous visible stitches and patchwork seams across its body and face.
  • It has a single, bulging eye on the right side of its head, a gaping mouth filled with sharp, irregular teeth, and a small, pig-like nose.
  • Two small, bat-like wings protrude from its back, colored reddish-orange with visible veins.
  • The monster stands in a hunched posture, with its left foot forward and both hands clenched into fists.
  • The label "The Behemoth" is placed in front of its left foot, on a green plaque with white text.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.
  • The illustration uses a muted, earthy color palette with emphasis on flesh tones and red/orange highlights in the wings.
  • The number "46" appears in green at the bottom left corner, possibly a page or figure number.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The creature dominates the foreground, occupying nearly the entire frame.
  • The wings are positioned behind the shoulders, and the head is tilted slightly to the right.
  • The label is placed at the base of the left foot, partially overlapping the toes.

Analysis :
  • The visual message emphasizes the unnatural, stitched-together, and intimidating nature of "The Behemoth."
  • The exaggerated proportions and patchwork design suggest a creature assembled from disparate parts, evoking themes of monstrosity and horror.
  • The label and number indicate this is likely an entry in a catalog or bestiary. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.052,t=0.559,r=0.548,b=0.953), with ID 67eeafdc-86c3-4148-8ea1-f864f0d1be0c -->

120. THE EMERALD DEPTHS                SEVERE 3

The winding passage ends in a large cavernous chamber. Running through the middle is an underground river rushing from east to west. A narrow bridge crosses the water; it looks slick with moisture and mold. On the far side of the chamber are immense formations of cloudy, green rock, and in front of them is a large black cauldron with a fire burning at its base. Light filters into this chamber from above through a twisting crevasse in the ceiling; the far side of the cavern is lit by glowing green orbs suspended by chains from stalactites. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.122,r=0.891,b=0.311), with ID 9b165464-8ca4-43bd-9777-e59b8b214edc -->

It was here that Vilree did much of the work to make the viridian vapor, starting with a thick solution of powdered flaystone. And it is here that Vilree waits for intruders. She likely received warning from the alchemical drudges that the PCs were drawing closer, and she is ready for them. When the PCs are all in the room, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.326,r=0.891,b=0.449), with ID 72b47dde-4e8a-4e7b-8d0f-86efe49d58df -->

Stepping out from behind the massive cauldron is a thin woman, gently pointed ears rising up from her oily, raven-black hair. She is wearing stitched leathers bearing countless pouches and pockets filled with glass vials. She looks at you with a sneer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.463,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 7b4325a8-6d45-450f-b430-942bd5db7838 -->

“So, you must be the fools that arrived with Bort. Sorry about your *friend*,” she says, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “I couldn’t let anyone piece together what had happened here, and he knew too much. I am sure you think you can stop me and save the town. You shouldn’t have bothered. They are a wicked, worthless lot and don’t deserve compassion. How could they, when they let their own suffer and die in agony? Scorning a child out of spite?” As she says the words, she looks at each of you in turn. “Leave now and never look back. No one need ever know you were here.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.541,r=0.890,b=0.710), with ID 7747fb0f-2261-47f1-8f6d-ae935e28d267 -->

It’s unlikely the characters will take Vilree up on her offer, but if they leave, she lets them. Assuming they don’t, she says only “Pity,” which is the command word for her greatest alchemical servant, the Behemoth, to rise up out of the water and hold the bridge between Vilree and the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.724,r=0.890,b=0.815), with ID f6368b2e-3701-49a9-acf7-04824c10017e -->

**Creatures:** Vilree and the Behemoth should make for a very dangerous encounter. The Behemoth’s sole job is to prevent anyone from getting across the bridge, while Vilree remains on the far side, lobbing bombs and firing her alchemical crossbow at the PCs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.555,t=0.817,r=0.890,b=0.892), with ID 381be350-aeed-4bd2-93a0-87a7fb16dca0 -->

Depending on how the fight goes with the
Behemoth, someone could get knocked into the
water. This water flows quickly from east to west <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.893,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID 982cebc1-7df5-4b6a-ad70-115fd199d948 -->

and, should anyone be swept out of the room, they
have almost no chance of surviving (the river enters
another underground cave about a half a mile from
here, and finding a way back to surface is another
adventure entirely). Swimming against the current
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check, but
the DC drops to 16 if the character swims with the
current or swims directly to the nearest edge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.127,r=0.453,b=0.248), with ID db6ecac5-2d27-4890-9efb-ad21d7dba7d2 -->

If the PCs take down the Behemoth and engage her in melee, Vilree drinks her moderate acid energy mutagen and draws her blade. She otherwise fights cautiously, using her crossbow and bombs, as well as elixirs of life to heal serious wounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.249,r=0.454,b=0.327), with ID 7a819336-b6df-4638-b485-5989a7c6dc84 -->

Summary : This is a fantasy character illustration of an elf-like figure named "Vilree Eldara," holding a crossbow and a magical object, with a sidebar listing adventure module sections.

illustration:  
Scene Overview :  
  • The main subject is a slender, elf-like character with pointed ears, dark clothing, and a dramatic, tattered cloak.  
  • The character is holding a crossbow with a glowing green vial attached and is conjuring pink magical energy in the other hand.  
  • The name "Vilree Eldara" is displayed on a green nameplate at the character's feet.  
  • The sidebar on the right lists adventure module sections: "Murder," "Part 2: The Ranger's Request," "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair," and "Adventure Toolbox," with a potion vial and sparkles as decorative elements.  
  • The background is mostly white, with the sidebar featuring a blue, organic border.

Technical Details :  
  • No scale bar or measurement indicators are present.  
  • The illustration uses a muted, dark color palette for the character, with bright green and pink highlights for magical effects.  
  • The sidebar uses parchment-like textures and stylized fonts.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The character is centrally placed, facing left, with the crossbow extended forward and the magical energy held behind.  
  • The sidebar is positioned vertically along the right edge, partially overlapping the character's outstretched arm.

Analysis :  
  • The illustration emphasizes the character's dual nature as both a ranged combatant (crossbow) and a magic user (magical energy).  
  • The sidebar suggests this image is from a tabletop roleplaying game adventure module, with the character likely being a significant NPC or antagonist.  
  • The dynamic pose and magical effects convey action and danger, fitting for a fantasy adventure context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.463,t=0.359,r=0.962,b=0.949), with ID 8d22ca77-c2fa-4e1a-b5d0-2c0b109d7630 -->

**Alchemical Crossbow** Vilree’s crossbow can deliver bolts that are alchemically infused. As an action, she can slot an alchemical bomb into the crossbow, and the next 3 attacks she makes with it deal 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the bomb. These attacks never deal splash damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.125,r=0.513,b=0.219), with ID e1f3dfb2-8f50-45fd-ac36-8f57309c3799 -->

Alchemy Vilree has used her alchemy ability to create 4 moderate acid flasks, 6 moderate alchemist’s fire, 2 moderate bottled lightnings, 3 lesser elixirs of life, and 2 lesser tanglefoot bags. These are infusions. She can spend an action to create an additional vial of any one of these items, or any of the items listed as formulas in her book. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.219,r=0.518,b=0.325), with ID f70b228d-6a10-4da7-939c-40b6645a14b0 -->

**Far Lob** Vilree's bombs have a range increment of 30 feet.  
**Quick Bomber** ![icon: black diamond with white arrow] Vilree can interact to draw a bomb and then make a Strike with it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.326,r=0.523,b=0.372), with ID 5b5c1a88-7bb8-4cea-a9fa-ace7d8f9e52f -->

Last Threat: Vilree is confident of victory, but if things turn against her she has one final ploy. When she’s reduced to fewer than half her total Hit Points, on her next turn, read or paraphrase the following. (This might also be adapted as she lies dying.) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.387,r=0.524,b=0.463), with ID effc46c2-0404-4f20-9bab-83c50acca39d -->

completing this critical part of the story. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.182,t=0.495,r=0.523,b=0.540), with ID 144f9879-dd35-401c-ba04-4f1e28a2902d -->

Vilree looks at you with contempt. “It doesn’t matter, you know. I’ve already won. I dispatched my minion to destroy the town just before you arrived here. Everyone in Plaguestone will be dead long before you ever get there!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.554,r=0.523,b=0.633), with ID 47af4000-d45c-40e2-8ecf-6d2778ea35de -->

Vilree sent an alchemical drudge to the town
shortly after the PCs arrived at her laboratory (or
about an hour ago, if the PCs took their time). The
drudge exited the chamber by climbing up and out
through the crevasse in the ceiling that provides light
to this chamber. The drudge is carrying Silwyth’s ring,
which has been enchanted so that, if it touches the
plaguestone, rock and ring will both explode, covering
the town in a growing cloud of viridian vapor. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.648,r=0.524,b=0.785), with ID 8665813f-9f87-4602-852d-f76f8cb756b7 -->

# RACE TO SAVE ETRAN'S FOLLY
By the time the PCs defeat Vilree, her alchemical drudge has a significant head start in the race back to Etran’s Folly. The PCs have a choice if they want to save the town: they can attempt to track the drudge, or they can race back to town and wait for it at the plaguestone. If the PCs have horses, they won’t have to stop and rest and won’t be fatigued for the final confrontation.

on horseback, they will beat the drudge by several  
hours, giving them time to prepare an ambush. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.127,r=0.890,b=0.158), with ID 3f23b09e-5def-4d1a-9e08-a625cc1bac3e -->

Track the Drudge  
If the PCs decide to track the drudge, they must first attempt a DC 20 Survival check to find its trail. This DC is reduced to 15 if they first locate the spot where the crevasse leading out of area I20 reaches the surface, as this is where the drudge first began its journey. Once the trail is discovered, it is relatively easy to follow. The drudge is relentless in completing its task, and it is not subtle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.170,r=0.891,b=0.309), with ID 55f90891-1d56-42bd-920e-5ea77852ef20 -->

During the chase, ask the PCs if they are taking any
breaks to rest or if they are simply pushing on despite
growing fatigue. Note this, as it will matter when it
comes to the final confrontation with the drudge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.311,r=0.890,b=0.371), with ID acaf5a6a-fca1-4930-bc16-10af70f9e8af -->

After finding the trail, it is a simple matter to follow the plodding footsteps of Vilree’s minion as it makes its way toward Etran’s Folly. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and the unsuspecting town grows ever closer. Vilree’s alchemical servant never seems to tire, and there is no sign that it ever stops for food or rest, but it does seem the distance is closing. The trail looks more and more recent. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.417,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID cf438c73-dec9-4e66-9ca4-467b09352fcc -->

Just as Etran's Folly comes into view, so does Vilree's drudge. It is close to the town but with haste it is still possible to catch it before it can complete its grim task! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.541,r=0.890,b=0.587), with ID f98359a6-f3d5-40c0-b47e-28409b5b4c96 -->

### RACE TO TOWN
If the PCs race the drudge back to town, they have no idea how fast their competition is traveling to the plaguestone. Although the journey is to the same place, the two divergent paths make it hard to guess who might be in the lead. Ask the PCs if they are taking breaks to rest or are simply pushing on despite growing fatigue. Note this for the confrontation with the drudge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.599,r=0.891,b=0.738), with ID 7dfcc268-cbc7-426d-9c8b-29b256517994 -->

There is still a grim possibility that the town of Etran’s Folly is now a town filled with the dead and dying. Miles pass, minutes turn to hours, and finally the unsuspecting village grows ever closer. There is no sign of Vilree’s minion, but that only adds to a growing sense of dread. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.785,r=0.890,b=0.876), with ID 469636ae-a6c9-4b9d-be9c-a8e652befb33 -->

Etran’s Folly comes into view at the crest of a hill.

Summary : This is a decorative illustrated sidebar from a fantasy roleplaying game adventure book, listing the main parts of the adventure and a toolbox section, framed by a magical, alchemical motif.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical parchment-like panel bordered by twisting, purple, root-like tendrils with glowing orange and yellow magical lights.
  • At the top, there is a glass flask containing a yellow liquid, suggesting an alchemical or magical theme.
  • The parchment lists the following text sections: "Part 1: A Mysterious Murder", "Part 2: The Ranger's Request", "Part 3: Into Vilree's Lair", and "Adventure Toolbox".
  • At the bottom, a small green potion vial and a book are depicted, reinforcing the fantasy and adventure theme.
Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.
  • The illustration uses a muted, earthy color palette with purples, greens, and yellows.
Spatial Relationships :
  • The parchment is centered vertically, with the magical border enveloping it on all sides.
  • The flask is at the top, the potion and book at the bottom, creating a vertical flow.
Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic chapter divider or table of contents, visually reinforcing the magical and adventurous tone of the book. The use of alchemical imagery and glowing effects draws attention to the importance of the listed sections. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.779,t=0.077,r=0.999,b=0.765), with ID 39d108e0-60e8-4a5c-9390-308abab643e8 -->

glowing green gas. The disease has the  
following statistics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.123,r=0.787,b=0.191), with ID 94d4423a-6eee-41bb-9fbc-1ba02d69e41e -->

Stopping the Drudge                Moderate 3
Once the scene is set, all that remains is to defeat the drudge before it can touch the ring to the plaguestone. If the PCs succeed, they will be hailed as heroes, but should they fail, a miasma will spread over the town, spelling the end of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.120,r=0.459,b=0.250), with ID 7ed96b47-200f-4866-a2e8-0da728df3bed -->

Creature: The alchemical drudge relentlessly carries out its final command. Its starting position and distance to the stone depends upon choices the PCs made. If they didn’t stop for breaks, the PCs are all fatigued (unless they have horses, in which case the horses are fatigued instead), but they can square off against the drudge while it is still at the edge of town, 120 feet away from the stone. If the PCs rested, the drudge starts only 60 feet from the stone, near the middle of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.248,r=0.459,b=0.494), with ID c95166eb-99e4-4ea5-b09d-af696d53aeb7 -->

If the PCs chased the drudge, they are just 30
feet behind it. If they raced to town on foot, they
start at the stone, but the drudge is 30 feet closer
to its destination. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.104,t=0.493,r=0.457,b=0.556), with ID 7fdd9c0b-3412-4add-9174-a935d8c56019 -->

Finally, if the PCs raced back to town on horses,
they arrive 2 hours before the drudge, but they must
stay alert because they don’t know when to expect
the drudge to arrive. They do, however, have the
chance to put up barriers or set an ambush, at your
discretion. At the very least, they start at the stone
and the drudge is 120 feet away, giving them ample
time to stop it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.556,r=0.455,b=0.678), with ID bc671fa0-2c5d-46de-b7ad-41b598805c2a -->

Once combat has begun, the drudge only fights
back if its path is blocked; otherwise, it moves
toward the stone with all its actions, heedless of
danger. Once adjacent to the stone, it must spend
one action to retrieve the ring and three more to
activate it. If it does, the plaguestone explodes,
killing the drudge instantly and dealing 6d6 slashing
damage to everyone within 30 feet (DC 22 basic
Reflex save). In addition, this explosion spreads the
viridian vapor all around town, infecting everyone
as noted in Hazard below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.678,r=0.455,b=0.849), with ID 73e35596-0573-40f7-a960-8ec00f266ae3 -->

clears the PCs and the members
of Bort’s caravan of Bort’s
murder. Even Sheriff Rolth is
impressed that the strangers
did so much to help the tiny community. Delma
lets them stay at the Feedmill, free of charge,
for as long as they like, and any tab they might
have acquired is wiped away. The PCs are free to
leave and continue their journey to Almas if they
like, but they will have to wait at least a day if
they want to continue traveling with what is now
Tamli’s caravan, as the caravan members want to
give Bort a proper burial. If the PCs decide to train
for a few days with Noala, Tamli and crew are
happy to wait as well, enjoying a little rest before
getting back on the road. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.397,r=0.819,b=0.647), with ID 4bc65831-bc42-46d4-acb6-95e6b20d46d5 -->

**Rewards:** Tamli invites the PCs to the funeral and gives them all a chance to say a few words, a fond farewell to the caravan master that treated them all amicably. In spite of any shady deals he might have made over the years with questionable characters, he was genuinely kind and fair to his staff and those who rode with him. Tamli sheds more than a few tears as she says goodbye and attempts to make peace with the situation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.648,r=0.820,b=0.786), with ID 00d0980b-6fa2-47ee-87db-8ea51d3b6b83 -->

After the ceremony, she approaches the PCs to give them a gift. Bort was fond of rings, collecting a variety of them throughout his travels. She wishes to give one ring to each character, and states that many of them are magical. Describe the rings and their powers to the PCs (as noted in Rules and Rewards on pages 57–58) and allow them each to choose one. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.786,r=0.821,b=0.908), with ID 54d0e6d6-67d6-4896-b075-69521740f1e8 -->

Not even mentioned on most maps, the town of Etran’s Folly has seen better days. The town’s population has never fully recovered from a plague that struck almost 20 years ago, and many of the homes on the north side of town stand empty and abandoned. In spite of such hardships, the townsfolk carry on and are friendly to outsiders and travelers. Those who approach are sure to marvel at huge turnip fields surrounding the village, but should be wary of the turnip ale favored by the locals—it’s quite strong and it’s definitely an acquired taste. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.651,r=0.900,b=0.929), with ID 971dd7db-3272-4def-a200-988f683aff8a -->

  • Decorative elements (vines, potion, stars) surround the text, with the potion at the top and the vial at the bottom.

Analysis :
  • The illustration serves as a thematic table of contents, visually dividing the adventure into three narrative parts and a toolbox section, reinforcing the magical and mysterious tone of the adventure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.794,t=0.093,r=1.000,b=0.763), with ID 01a8bfac-decb-42aa-98a9-11b3117a8f57 -->

used to be sheep pastures. The path
leads from the north side of town, out
through the fields, to the old shrine,
and back around to the south side
of town, passing by Etran’s Hill.
**Etran’s Hill:** To the southeast
of town is a small hill covered in
old stones and bits of burned debris.
This site was once the home of the
town’s founder, Etran Bolmere, and
his family. They moved to this area
from Taldor, hoping to found a small
community as a stopover for the
overland travel through the region.
Rumor has it he built up on the hill
so that all would see it, despite it
being far away from the nearest
source of fresh water. Just 5
years after founding the town,
the house burned down, killing
Etran and his family, while also giving
the town its current name (it was originally
called Etranton). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.461,t=0.120,r=0.820,b=0.478), with ID f2745c24-9cff-4910-9385-6cf3eac6a1f9 -->

This section of this book includes useful tools for running “The Fall of Plaguestone.” In the following pages you’ll find a gazetteer of the town, including brief descriptions of the town’s significant inhabitants. There is also a quick review of the NPC caravan members, new character backgrounds tied to this adventure, rules and rewards found only here, a selection of side quests that link with the new backgrounds, and a few new monsters.

ETRAN’S FOLLY GAZETTEER  
Etran’s Folly is a tiny community of about 300 people, but many of them live on farms or in small homes on the outskirts. It once sported a population nearly double that number, but a plague wiped out a number of families 20 years ago and the community has never fully recovered. Aside from the Feedmill and the ruins up on Etran’s Hill, the buildings in town are of typical wattle-and-daub construction, with thick thatch roofs.

LOCATIONS AROUND ETRAN’S FOLLY

**Dead Homes:** The homes on the north side of Etran’s Folly are mostly empty these days, and most are in a state of severe disrepair. When the plague hit the town a little less than 20 years ago, this neighborhood saw many casualties and as a result, almost no one lives here today. Those who do call this part of town home are either desperate or are squatters with no official claim to the property. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.618,r=0.453,b=0.740), with ID cb1c9a0f-bd52-489e-bec1-74eb9e4ac7a0 -->

**Dead Willow:** On the northwest edge of town, near the river, stands an old dead willow tree in front of a dilapidated home. Though not unlike other nearby homes with overgrown plants and poorly maintained structures, this one is significant because it is the home of Hallod, the town bully and servant of Vilree. This home and the dungeon beneath it are both fully described in the Hallod’s Hideout portion of the adventure, starting on page 15. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.741,r=0.453,b=0.878), with ID b10b4a45-e78e-4fd6-b92c-7dfeccea31f5 -->

**Drunk Shepherd’s Path:** Wandering through the outskirts of town, the Drunk Shepherd’s Path is little more than a meandering foot trail that leads through the nearby turnip farms, many of which <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.878,r=0.453,b=0.941), with ID 6ef47242-78bd-4293-b142-2c6afc2c9e21 -->

Feedmill: Located in the center of town, the Feedmill is the town’s only inn, tavern, and general store, all crammed into one overcrowded business. Since it happens to be the only place in town with rooms to rent (albeit in the loft above the stables), it is the place where Bort and his caravan stay every time they visit. While the accommodations are far from great, the old straw mattresses are still better than sleeping on the hard earth outside. The food here is passing at best, with much of it focused on the town’s primary crop: turnips. A typical meal here consists of roasted wild game, turnip stew, a slice of dry seedcake, and a sweet turnip porridge for desert. Few desire seconds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.473,t=0.471,r=0.820,b=0.694), with ID aa7df5ae-4c52-435b-acfc-797be4565b93 -->

The Feedmill is owned by Targen Fulst, the aging
mayor of the town who opened the business over
50 years ago. Targen is far too old and senile to take
part in the day-to-day activities, instead leaving
those to his daughter, Delma Fulst, who also tends
the bar and the till for the general store. The other
employees are Amora Kasillan (cook), Edra Wythe
(stablehand), Kolnral Brannak (server), Phinick
Padley (helper), and Trin Sathern (server). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.694,r=0.820,b=0.833), with ID a17432dd-9b9a-4f51-a142-995e5411c960 -->

Most common items (level 1) can be found in the
general store, but unless they’re items that might be
useful to a farming community, the store has only
one or two in stock. The only magic items they
have on hand are three *minor healing potions* and
a *potency crystal*. No alchemical items are in stock,
and if anyone asks Delma, she simply replies that the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.832,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID 0a0633fa-4a45-40ec-a8e3-ce5fea9b8037 -->

town hasn’t had “one of them chymist witches” for
almost 20 years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.126,r=0.524,b=0.157), with ID 8a4f21d9-ed52-4383-84a8-9efc48e88ba9 -->

Old Shrine: The town once offered prayers to a number of deities, with Gozreh chief among them. Most townspeople ventured out to this small shrine dedicated to Gozreh just outside of town, located in a dell brimming natural beauty. After the plague took the town’s only priest, much of the community’s faith has faded. While most residents still offer up prayers now and then, there are no organized services, and most holy days are observed only in small, personal gatherings. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.178,t=0.158,r=0.458,b=0.387), with ID 9f50c124-c871-479d-9028-6526e9826178 -->

Today, the old shrine is in the  
process of being reclaimed by the  
wilds. Its standing stones are covered  
with a tangled mass of moss and ivy.  
Worse still, the shrine is now home to a nest  
of four bloodseekers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.388,r=0.476,b=0.479), with ID bd302a33-2a9c-459f-bb4a-217ff556367e -->

**Plaguestone:** At the height of the plague, the healthy kept their distance from the sick, hoping to stave off infection. As heartless as this might seem, the town did come up with a way to offer aid and succor to the quarantined ill. Just west of the Feedmill, a great stone was used to exchange food and remedies for coin, with the aid being placed on one side and the coins dropped into a depression on the other side that was filled with vinegar to decontaminate them. This plaguestone was the only contact that the ill had with others in town and their loved ones. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.479,r=0.524,b=0.662), with ID fa05408f-d909-4e14-bb66-0a248578a4df -->

Today, the stone is covered in moss and ivy, a
silent witness to those grim months. The town
folk pay it no heed, which might prove to be their
downfall, as Vilree’s plan to destroy the town uses
this very stone as the implement of her revenge.
Over the past few years, she has slowly hollowed
out the inside of the stone using acid and filled
it with a virulent plague. Anyone inspecting the
stone might notice a crack in the top, but there is
no way for observes to detect the deep reservoir
of alchemical soup that hides within, aside from
destroying the stone. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.664,r=0.524,b=0.847), with ID 605576f4-636d-42d7-9e51-ef10ecad3b72 -->

NPCS AROUND TOWN  
The following NPCs can be found in and around the town of Etran’s Folly. Unless otherwise noted, they are 0-level characters with a +5 bonus to skills applicable to their profession. In most cases, they <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.856,r=0.524,b=0.941), with ID a5f4b96c-d80c-4164-9bbc-4d12b289ba64 -->

flee or surrender if faced with violence unless their
lives or the lives of their loved ones are in danger.
Each entry contains a brief description of the
NPC and their general attitude. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.126,r=0.890,b=0.187), with ID 39c17526-34dc-49e5-a310-9fe5c1234b96 -->

Amora Kasillan (LN female human cook): Amora spends most of her days in the Feedmill’s kitchen. She’s loud and boisterous and can often be heard singing off-key while she works. She is very proud of her cooking, boasting that everything has to be just right, and that she makes the finest meals in Etran’s Folly. She does not allow any substitutions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.599,t=0.188,r=0.892,b=0.325), with ID 0d6afb32-f6f6-4595-8b6a-29873b74d410 -->

Amora stands at just under 6 feet tall, with short brown hair kept tied tight behind her head. She is rarely seen without an apron on, even at home. Amora’s voice and laughter are as big as she is, and while she is perfectly friendly to guests, she can fly into a fury if anyone criticizes her cooking. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.598,t=0.326,r=0.892,b=0.463), with ID 290d3aa2-491b-492a-9463-1847baa2cf3a -->

**Delma Fulst (NG female human bartender):**
Daughter of mayor Targen Fulst, Delma rung the Feedmill, the town’s only tavern, inn, and general store. Delma has a shrewd eye for business that she learned from her father, but unlike him, she has compassion and empathy for the folks around town. She knows that without the Feedmill, the town would probably fade away, so she does everything in her power to ensure that it is always well stocked and offers up fair prices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.465,r=0.891,b=0.616), with ID 2498bca3-fd87-4a62-9039-8a86de4dcf14 -->

Edra Wythe (NG female halfling stablehand):
Edra works in the stables and barn at the Feedmill. She takes her job seriously—when there actually work to be done. Otherwise she can be found napping in one of the stables, passed out from drinking too much turnip ale. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.618,r=0.890,b=0.708), with ID 4f446cf4-8fbf-479e-8077-49f8b2ceaa09 -->

**Farmer Eallom (CN male human farmer):** Farmer Eallom is the town drunk, and lives in a run-down turnip farm on the edge of town. He spends most nights at the Feedmill getting drunk on turnip ale and a tarry rum-like drink that the locals just call “wagon grease” (also made from turnips). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.710,r=0.889,b=0.800), with ID 62aa8e09-d63b-4736-a93d-c511166a24e8 -->

Flonk the Bard (CG male half-elf musician):
Flonk is the town’s only source of musical entertainment, not that he is any good, despite decades of practice. His lute is missing two strings, and the self-proclaimed “bard” knows only about a half-dozen songs. He can be found at the Feedmill every night, singing and strumming away—badly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.549,t=0.802,r=0.889,b=0.907), with ID 78659d52-79bb-478a-ab39-5d2cca4062f6 -->

Hallod (LE male human bully): Hallod is a large, imposing man, bearing a number of scars <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.550,t=0.908,r=0.891,b=0.939), with ID 86e1a81f-cedf-4d58-933d-cec557ba5fbb -->

crisscrossing his face from years of bar fights. He is
one of Vilree’s servants in town, and he is the one
who accepts the shipment from Bort when
the caravan first arrives. Hallod is
also the one who bullies Phinick
into poisoning the merchant. PCs
can find Hallod in the Feedmill
at night or in his shack at the
northern edge of town. Hallod
appears in area F of the adventure,
which starts on page 15. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.454,b=0.295), with ID 6a035de4-bd97-4119-9953-0ba50f3f5033 -->

little, as most justice in Etran’s Folly is
metered out with crude blades or farm
tools long before he arrives. Rolth’s
only real job is to handle disputes
between farmers over crops
and livestock. Rolth is lazy and
not too bright, and he is so out of
shape that most who want to avoid
his justice need only to run away.
When Bort is murdered, Rolth’s only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.466,t=0.120,r=0.823,b=0.374), with ID 554f2bb3-67ca-45ed-a013-12b01c12a753 -->

Kolnral Brannak (NG male human server): Kolnral is one of two servers at the Feedmill, along with Trin Sathern, and is quite skilled at his job. His wife and child also tend to a small plot on the eastern side of town to bolster the family’s income. Kolnral is friendly but not too interested in talking to strangers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.295,r=0.398,b=0.449), with ID 2957ef8c-dc23-4068-8e49-661919064a33 -->

Noala Kesrir (NG Female Elf Ranger):
Noala came to the region of Etran’s Folly about 10 years ago, settling here after serving as a mercenary in the Goblinblood Wars. Toward the end of that struggle, she was caught inside a burning building during a raid. Her right arm was terribly burned in the fire, making that hand all but useless. As a result, she wears a custom leather gauntlet over her right hand that allows her to fire her bow, but it reduces her accuracy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.449,r=0.455,b=0.602), with ID 84996dd8-94ea-492b-9fbe-46b2ffb3fab7 -->

Noala thinks of herself as a steward of these
lands, even though no one else seems to recognize
her as such. She is rarely found in town unless
needed, instead preferring to work in the wild,
preserving the delicate balance in the woodlands
around the community. Only Delma seems to
recognize and appreciate Noala for all she does
for the town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.602,r=0.454,b=0.724), with ID ee4219b0-734b-4e71-bfb5-ecbe06410874 -->

Phinick Padley (CN male goblin helper):  
Performing all sorts of odd jobs around the Feedmill, Phinick can most often be found helping with inventory in the morning, then transitioning over to help Amora in the kitchen in the afternoon. Phinick is tolerated by the townsfolk, but only barely—a fact that keeps him on edge. The twitchy goblin is rather timid and shy around big folk, trying too hard to fit in. Phinick is bullied into adding a special “spice” to Bort’s food in Part 1 of the adventure, and he quickly goes into hiding after the merchant’s death. For more on Phinick, see Chasing Phinick on page 14. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.724,r=0.454,b=0.907), with ID b9932e28-46af-4a5f-a0fe-701b3acbab98 -->

**Roth Garley (LN male human sheriff):** Roth is the only law in town, but he does relatively <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.908,r=0.455,b=0.940), with ID bd48044f-7962-4a3a-b0f6-71701978797a -->

when Bort is murdered, Roth’s only
decisive action is to hold the caravan to
determine who among the crew killed
their boss. When the PCs step up and
offer to help, he reluctantly agrees,
knowing that he is entirely out of
his depth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.544,t=0.273,r=0.821,b=0.376), with ID 0710d819-8e22-4a8d-9951-4f6d8ebdcae1 -->

Sir Lawren Krent (LG male human ex-paladin): Poor Sir Lawren arrived here a few months ago when the caravan he was traveling with left without him. Disgraced and drunken, Sir Lawren saw things during the fall of Lastwall that he cannot unsee without the aid of strong drink. He can most often be found drinking in the tavern of the Feedmill or passed out in a lean-to shelter nearby. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.371,r=0.821,b=0.526), with ID e5a9c7bd-d8e3-4b44-a34a-b2916663d0dc -->

**Targen Fulst (CG male human mayor):** Targen was known around town as being a bit forgetful 20 years ago, but at age 80, he is mostly infirm, with poor eyesight and trouble walking more than a few steps at a time. His memory is now badly failing him, and he has trouble remembering the name of his daughter Delma, sometimes referring to her as Reganna, his long-passed wife. The entire Fulst family is related to Etran Bolmere, who founded the town a few hundred years ago. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.526,r=0.820,b=0.678), with ID 8710ca7d-382f-410b-b1da-ee21db48401a -->

Although Targen has long abdicated any mayoral responsibilities, the town has yet to name a new mayor, seeing no need with so few inhabitants. Targen lost most of his family to goblins in the Goblinblood war, and as a result, he is very distrusting of any goblin characters he might meet, keeping an eye on them and clutching at valuables. However, he has grown to tolerate Phinick. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.678,r=0.821,b=0.801), with ID f950704b-5d50-4f96-af58-93142576084e -->

**Trin Sathern (NG female human server):** Working every night at the Feedmill, Trin dreams of escaping Etran’s Folly. She desperately wants to leave this place and make a new life for herself in Almas or some other city. If the players show any sign of helping her leave town, she becomes especially friendly, as the thought of getting out of the place is almost intoxicating to her. She is excited to hear any tale about faraway lands or unfamiliar places. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.801,r=0.822,b=0.940), with ID 91b93fbc-822d-47c9-b3df-0f49b9d55a72 -->

BORT'S TALES
The following are just a sample of the outlandish stories told by the traveling merchant Bort Bargith. These tales are so practiced that Bort receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Perform checks to impress when he uses one of them and to any Deception check he attempts to defend the tales' more outlandish claims. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.194,t=0.120,r=0.506,b=0.249), with ID a601a565-cea6-4055-ad22-ef4f9bb238a1 -->

**Bort and the Chilled Giant:** In this tale, Bort was traveling through one of the high mountain roads in the Five Kings Mountains when his caravan was captured by a fire giant. As Bort was being lowered into a kettle, he managed to trick the giant into using a rare plant called "frostbloom" in his soup, claiming it was quite spicy. When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.

**Pharasma's Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort's boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.193,t=0.249,r=0.511,b=0.632), with ID bec99448-ac1a-4ab9-a186-3ae7be7a08e1 -->

BORT'S CARAVAN AND CREW
Traveling all around the Five King's Mountains and into the lands beyond, Bort's Merchant Caravan is well known and regarded as a fair and honest purveyor of goods, raw materials, and supplies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.657,r=0.524,b=0.740), with ID 0ee4cf2b-331f-4a54-a701-136afa30384a -->

**Bort Bargith (NG male dwarf merchant):** Bort keeps his prodigious beard immaculately trimmed and well maintained. Bort is a friendly, honest merchant, who prides himself on having whatever a small community might need. He’s warm and caring toward the members of his crew and polite and courteous to his paying passengers. He can often be found with a mug of ale in one hand and savory food in the other, telling some outlandish story about his travels, which generally involves him getting out of danger in the most ridiculous of ways (see the Bort’s Tales sidebar). He is slow to anger, quick to laugh, and more than capable of verbally dancing out of any danger. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.181,t=0.741,r=0.524,b=0.940), with ID e8aabcaf-5d87-4bd2-b69f-5e4c990ad10f -->

Cooky (LN old male elf cook): Aged even for an elf, Cooky’s real name is Talair Starlight, although only Bort knows that. To everyone else he is Cooky, the merchant caravan’s resident cook—although some call him “cocky” behind his back, owing to the fact that he only has one ear and is constantly tilting his head to one side to compensate. Attached to the back of Cooky’s wagon is a large iron pan that can hold hot coals and even burning logs, allowing him to slow cook stew in a pot above the flames, even while travelling. Cooky has a hard time hearing most folk, although many of the others in the caravan think he can hear just fine and chooses to ignore others when they irritate him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.546,t=0.127,r=0.892,b=0.325), with ID 20aed1f8-e5af-4f50-9072-532705c86589 -->

**Glunda Grapeleaf (N female gnome teamster):**
Born in heart of the Fangwood, Glunda has always had a strong tie to the beasts and plants of the world. When she was taken in by the druids in Crystalhurst, she developed her skills, even learning to speak with animals. Her time with the druids was not to last, for soon after the desire to wander called to her, and she left Nirmathas, joining up with Bort’s caravan to travel and see the world. Glunda regularly uses her rudimentary skills to speak to the pack animals and tend to their needs. She almost never talks to anyone other than Tamli and Bort unless absolutely necessary, preferring to sleep near the animals rather than gather round the fire. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.327,r=0.891,b=0.539), with ID 577e74bc-90ec-4696-96ab-2fe631f55ca0 -->

Olf and Ulf Redfren (CG male human teamsters):
Hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twin Ulfen brothers used to be part of a merchant vessel that plied the waters of Lake Encarthan, but when war came the region, the boat was sunk and the two barely made it to shore alive. They signed up with Bort soon after. These gregarious brothers like to play pranks on the other members of the caravan and their traveling companions and frequently dress alike and try to confuse people as to who is Olf and who is Ulf. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.541,r=0.891,b=0.693), with ID 62f76aeb-09e4-4a1e-bad0-02bfee4017d6 -->

Tamli Grent (LN female half-orc chief): If Bort is the smiling face behind the caravan, Tamli is its overseer. As Bort’s second in command, Tamli oversees the other staff and wagons in the train, making sure that all are in good spirits and good working order respectively. She is skilled at handling beasts of burden, but stern with the other members of the caravan. Her personal manner with outsiders and passengers are a bit brusque and awkward. She carries a lock of hair on a leather cord around her neck that’s from her son, who she lost years ago when she fled from Belkzen. She doesn’t like to talk about it with those she doesn’t trust. The only person she regularly confides in is Bort, although she can often be heard barking orders at the other members of the caravan. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.695,r=0.891,b=0.938), with ID 247addfa-5fde-4a2b-8973-ac819295cc3a -->

CHARACTER CREATION AND BACKGROUNDS
This adventure is designed for 1st-level characters, built using the rules found in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. In addition to the backgrounds presented in that book, the following are additional background options available to PCs at the start of the game to represent their ties to the world and the story that is unfolding in Isger and its neighboring countries. Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.118,r=0.455,b=0.390), with ID 65b9303d-3334-4982-9962-2d8e08bc1f08 -->

Lesser Scion  
You are the youngest child in a noble house (in Cheliax, Isger, or Andoran) and stand to inherit nothing from your family. Although you have a minor title, it affords you no lands or wealth, but it has garnered you a small amount of respect and deference in your travels. When play begins, you are riding in a caravan bound for Almas, where a cousin has promised to allow you to stay with them for a month. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.399,r=0.454,b=0.540), with ID e942e704-f401-49cf-9f72-cc0a1ac1eaea -->

**LOST AND ALONE**  
You were training to become a knight in Lastwall when the Whispering Tyrant escaped his imprisonment and destroyed the nation. It was only by dumb luck that you are alive at all, but the memories of that fateful day haunt your dreams.

GM NOTES: BACKGROUNDS  
Although the characters can be of  
any background, you should encourage the  
players to consider the ones presented in  
this adventure, as characters with these  
backgrounds will find it easier to integrate  
themselves into the story. These backgrounds also  
help contextualize the characters in the events of  
the world around them.  
  GMs should take particular note if any  
of the PCs are interested in selecting the  
teamster background. The group should  
contain no more than one character with this  
background. The adventure assumes that any  
such character just joined the caravan and  
hence has no special knowledge about the  
other teamsters or the town of Etran’s Folly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.112,r=0.818,b=0.397), with ID e177064b-5397-4138-8047-44a2e31c8992 -->

REFUGEE  
The fighting around the Lake Encarthan region has forced many of the people residing there to flee from the violence. Although your home is gone, you have managed to survive and are making your way south in search of a better life. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan taking you to what might be either a new home in Andoran or simply another waypoint in your journey. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.523,r=0.819,b=0.662), with ID 8b5a6ab4-d4a0-4499-bee5-7294721dfd3b -->

TEAMSTER

You don’t know anyone from the company just yet, but most of its members seem to be honest merchants and traders. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.752,r=0.819,b=0.877), with ID d4e5995c-a57c-4e28-bf73-7481d1be9cc2 -->

ALCHEMICAL CROSSBOW

UNCOMMON   ALCHEMICAL

This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an *acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bottled lightning, frost vial,* or *thunderstone*). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.179,t=0.336,r=0.526,b=0.681), with ID ff0319c3-fc13-4642-ba70-0051212b5d0e -->

Summary : This image displays the description and effects of a potion or elixir from a role-playing game, including its benefits, drawbacks, types, levels, prices, and durations, accompanied by an illustration of the potion bottle.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a stylized potion bottle with ornate gold and red designs, shown upright on the right side of the image.
  • The left side contains text detailing the potion's in-game effects, benefits, drawbacks, and two types (lesser and moderate).
  • The composition is split vertically, with the bottle on the right and text on the left.
  • The lighting is even, and the colour palette is dominated by reds, golds, and browns.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement is present.
  • The text includes specific game mechanics: resistance to physical damage (except bludgeoning), speed reduction, penalty to Reflex saves, and durations for each potion type.
  • The potion types are "lesser" (Level 5, Price 22 gp, 10 minutes duration) and "moderate" (Level 12, Price 300 gp, 1 hour duration).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The potion bottle is in the foreground, occupying the right third of the image.
  • The text is left-aligned and occupies the remaining two-thirds, with clear separation between the illustration and the written content.

Analysis :
  • The image is designed to provide both a visual reference for the potion and a detailed description of its in-game effects, making it easy for players to identify and understand the item. The ornate design of the bottle suggests value and importance, while the text offers clear mechanical information for gameplay. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.551,t=0.551,r=0.895,b=0.781), with ID d3cea476-4911-4e48-abd2-bb7e894a13a8 -->

Noala’s Training  
After the PCs assist Noala in finding the source of the blight and investigating the Pen, she agrees to teach them some of her special woodland survival techniques. Her knowledge can be disseminated in several of the following ways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.844,r=0.891,b=0.940), with ID 982e5008-8da8-4445-ad26-018f9064ac3a -->

**Ranger Archetype:** Noala can assist any character that is looking into selecting the ranger multiclass archetype. Furthermore, if a character has the ranger archetype, Noala’s Wilderness Spotter feat counts as a ranger archetype feat for that character (if the character selects the feat multiple times, it is a ranger archetype feat only the first time). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.126,r=0.455,b=0.234), with ID 3dedab88-2d8c-4a87-b38b-09ac2cf5173b -->

Retraining: Noala can serve as a teacher who can retrain ranger feats and skill feats as long as the new skill feat is linked to Nature or Survival. As long as the feat being trained is level 5 or lower, Noala reduces the training time to the minimum allowed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.235,r=0.454,b=0.326), with ID 804361b7-bc6e-4e9e-afd2-2b73d92b29c9 -->

**Special Feats:** Noala can teach the characters a special ranger feat as well as a special skill feat that can be taken by anyone trained in Survival. Note that Noala’s training does not grant characters these feats, but merely unlocks them for later selection. This training takes about 2 days per feat but can take place at the same time as any retraining performed with Noala. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.327,r=0.455,b=0.435), with ID 573e88c5-1c5d-49ce-a710-221460b69b30 -->

RELENTLESS STALKER 🗘                                    FEAT 2

UNCOMMON      MOVE      RANGER
Trigger An adjacent creature you are hunting attempts to move away from you using an action that has the move trait.
Your hunted prey cannot escape your relentless pursuit. Stride up to your Speed in tandem with the triggering creature, remaining adjacent to the foe throughout its movement until it stops moving or you run out of movement. You can ignore difficult terrain during this movement unless the difficult terrain is caused by a magical effect. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.443,r=0.455,b=0.633), with ID c64c0f4a-1836-49f9-b122-7473989e903e -->

WILDERNESS SPOTTER FEAT 2

UNCOMMON   GENERAL   SKILL
Prerequisite Expert in Survival
Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren’t tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.643,r=0.454,b=0.846), with ID bc376a5a-c93d-4d07-bbc0-6860c14b4fa3 -->

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.847,r=0.454,b=0.880), with ID bc856e43-2e88-4cd3-bef9-4b1fdbb21750 -->

Fiery Leopard  
Through their actions at the Pen, the PCs might have befriended the fiery leopard found in area H3. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.888,r=0.455,b=0.942), with ID 55073d2a-614c-4751-bcba-69dc7e96579e -->

Once released, the leopard bolts from the Pen, but, at the GM’s discretion, it might appear again to help with the fight against the alchemical dredge at the very end of this adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.125,r=0.785,b=0.203), with ID 807dd0af-af15-435d-bc36-cdd994a5e9ac -->

After this point, the leopard continues to shadow the group and anyone with Nature can slowly attempt to befriend the wild beast. This process should take at least 10 downtime days, during which time the character attempting to befriend the leopard must succeed on at least three DC 18 Nature checks. No more than one check may be attempted per day. If the character fails to succeed at three Nature checks within this time, the leopard loses interest and wanders off. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.204,r=0.820,b=0.357), with ID 74e22263-20bd-4cac-8918-a37b7a216098 -->

If successful, and if the character has the ability to take on an animal companion, then that character gains the fiery leopard as an animal companion at the end of the 10 days. Treat the fiery leopard as a cat (see page 215 of the Core Rulebook) with the following modifications. If no one takes the fiery leopard as an animal companion, it will never truly be part of the group, but it may still follow them on adventures and help out at random times, subject to the GM’s discretion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.356,r=0.821,b=0.510), with ID a7512094-401e-42fe-bda0-62e76fac7ca4 -->

**Burning Glow** The fiery leopard sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius which gives it a -2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks made at night or in a dark environment. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.725,r=0.821,b=0.773), with ID 36b62184-9489-459b-979d-f6bbd8aa1b58 -->

BORT'S INHERITANCE  
Being a well-groomed merchant with a penchant for finery, Bort is fond of jewelry, particularly rings. He has a number of fine magical rings in his collection that he keeps among the rest of his possessions in his wagon when he’s not wearing them. Bort has collected these rings from his travels, and aside from being valuable magic items in their own right, Bort has an associated story and memory from each of them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.782,r=0.821,b=0.940), with ID 76825612-1f88-476c-8bae-c70508957157 -->

BACKGROUND SIDE QUESTS  
Depending on the backgrounds of the player characters, one or more small side quests might occur during this adventure. While all are focused on backgrounds presented in this adventure, most are also suitable for characters with certain backgrounds from the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (noted where relevant in parentheses in the Background entry). These side quests can occur at any point during the adventure. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.105,t=0.119,r=0.456,b=0.280), with ID 2e863559-6434-4570-b862-fa2bec627a84 -->

Finally, the refugee background doesn’t have a
specific side quest presented here, but you are free to
add if you wish. Use the side quests presented here as
examples when building your own. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.281,r=0.454,b=0.343), with ID 5c8ba61c-e699-42c8-bb3c-ab13e79cdc49 -->

Dereliction and Redemption  
Background: lost and alone (Warrior)  
Sir Lawren Krent is running from far more than just the nightmares he saw during the fall of Lastwall: he is also hiding from a terrible shame. Unfortunately, the result of his cowardice followed him here to Etran’s Folly, and it wants revenge. Just after sunset, Sir Lawren approaches the characters with a look of worry and panic on his face. Speaking directly to the character with the appropriate background, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.353,r=0.454,b=0.528), with ID c694ecb7-3be6-48b9-8894-40bf21a0b20a -->

Krent looks at you with his eyes wide and bloodshot.  
“Talmore, my old friend. You have to help me. I think *his* minions have followed us here. I seen ’em. They’re coming!” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.538,r=0.453,b=0.591), with ID 1a3ca30e-939b-4ad0-943b-d1828b3587ac -->

Krent is clearly deep into his drink, and in his
altered state, he sees one of the PCs as his former
comrade Talmore. Though he’s clearly mistaken,
what is real is his apparent terror that minions of
the Whispering Tyrant have followed him to Etran’s
Folly. In truth, Krent is partly correct. Talmore was
a fellow crusader in Lastwall and Krent’s close
friend, but when Lastwall fell, Krent left Talmore’s
side during a fight to hide from the undead horde.
When it was over, he searched the battlefield only
to find his friend’s mangled body. Distraught, Krent
took Talmore’s holy symbol and fled. The incident
weighs heavily on poor Krent, and he’s been running
ever since. Now, the knight is seeing things, but while
most of his visions are simply manifestations of his
shame and guilt, one is not. The ghost of Talmore is
indeed haunting him. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.601,r=0.453,b=0.862), with ID 609263cf-b554-4794-9217-aeb733f62a0f -->

From this point onward, Krent sees the PC as his
long-lost friend, recounting old tales, apologizing for
the time he left a scar on his face after accidentally
cutting him during sparring practice, and asking
how he managed to escape Lastwall. If the PC <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.863,r=0.453,b=0.941), with ID f9c09aad-eb16-4b52-a26d-3dfcb58c3885 -->

acts confused, Krent merely plays it off  
as a joke and continues treating the PC  
as Talmore. Clever characters might easily  
get Krent to reveal parts of his history by  
pretending to be Talmore. Throughout, Krent  
insists that the enemy is here, begging his friend  
for help in defeating the vile undead agents. If the  
character agrees, Krent says that they are hiding in  
an old ruined farmhouse that Krent occupied when  
he first came to town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.122,r=0.813,b=0.281), with ID 1e9c2527-7e33-4041-ab5a-dd6678168b81 -->

Confronting the Ghost        Moderate 1
The creature that dwells here is the ghost of Talmore, bound to the holy symbol that Krent took from his dead body. If the PCs enter the dilapidated house, read or paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.291,r=0.820,b=0.373), with ID 253fe32f-d02f-45af-98ca-5f61cc6d9188 -->

A sagging straw roof barely protects this abandoned house from the elements. Piles of debris litter the common room, which shows signs of occupation, although not too recently. A backpack sits in one corner with a glint of silver inside its open flap, resting next to a shattered chair and a moldy old blanket. Quite suddenly the air seems to grow cold, and the sound of moaning fills the house. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.384,r=0.819,b=0.512), with ID f8f3afcd-061f-4da6-bfe5-8a29d735db28 -->

The ghost of Talmore appears and attacks any who are inside the home (using the statistics of a ghost commoner with the weak adjustment), but he will not pursue them or attack downed foes. He looks like the gaunt form of a soldier whose raiment is quite similar to Sir Lawren’s. The ghost appears to have a nasty-looking scar running down one side of his face. If the ghost is defeated, he rematerializes after only a few days to continue haunting the holy symbol of Iomedae. The only way to put him to rest is by giving the holy symbol a proper burial, something the PCs can learn if they know the holy symbol’s origin and succeed at a DC 16 Religion check. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.524,r=0.819,b=0.724), with ID 37fffe9e-f03d-40a9-b149-e5851e3a3e0e -->

The characters can avoid fighting the ghost if they can convince Krent to enter the home and apologize to the ghost of his friend. If he does so, the ghost fades away for the evening, allowing the PCs to bury the holy symbol in peace. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.475,t=0.725,r=0.820,b=0.802), with ID 510af734-a2c5-4219-b03d-fce745ff3591 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a spectral armored knight holding a glowing sword and shield, labeled "Ghost of Talmore".

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a ghostly armored knight rendered in shades of blue and white, giving a spectral, ethereal appearance.
  • The knight is clad in full plate armor with a flowing mane-like plume and a skirted lower half.
  • The shield is large, kite-shaped, and features a radiant sunburst or star emblem glowing at its center.
  • The sword is also glowing, matching the spectral blue theme.
  • The figure stands in a dynamic pose, facing slightly to the right, with the shield forward and sword angled downward.
  • The label "Ghost of Talmore" appears at the bottom in a fantasy-style font on a dark plaque.
  • The background is plain white, with some leafy plant elements intruding from the upper left edge.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit size reference.
  • The illustration uses a cool color palette dominated by blues and whites, with glowing effects on the armor, sword, and shield.
  • The label is centered below the figure, with a green-black background and white text.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The knight occupies the central and lower portion of the image, with the shield on the left and sword on the right.
  • The leafy plant in the upper left is in the background and does not interact with the main subject.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a supernatural, heroic, or legendary character, likely from a fantasy setting.
  • The glowing effects and ethereal color scheme emphasize the ghostly, otherworldly nature of the "Ghost of Talmore".
  • The prominent shield and sword suggest a defensive and martial role. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.034,t=0.320,r=0.530,b=0.947), with ID 11508380-f941-492a-afcb-564aeaffc7d5 -->

has a revelation. This PC is a distant relative of both
Targen and the town’s founder, Etran Bolmere.
  When Targen hears the name of the PCs, read or
paraphrase the following. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.126,r=0.892,b=0.189), with ID 2e015cd3-ab12-4ea4-9f1c-5b14543e7a99 -->

“Well, isn’t that peculiar.” The aging mayor stares at you intently. “I thought something about you looked familiar. I think we might be kin. Distantly, but I remember my father telling tales of the family history, and your family was mentioned at least once.” As he continues, he seems almost disappointed. “Such a shame that the family history went up in flames with the rest of the Bolmere estate.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.201,r=0.891,b=0.312), with ID 7e584445-fa18-44bd-9ae3-f69e54c58184 -->

Targen knows nothing else about the relationship,
stating that any proof would reside in the ruins of
the Bolmere estate, atop Etran’s Hill. In any case,
after he lets Delma know that the PC is kin, that PC
receives free room and board at the Feedmill. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.325,r=0.891,b=0.402), with ID 7a9721cf-dc73-43bd-8f1c-6842bab635e5 -->

The ruins of the Bolmere estate are just south of town. The place is entirely overgrown, but much of the scorched and crumbling stonework can still be seen under a layer of moss and ivy. Thoroughly searching the ruins takes at least an hour. At the end of that time, roll a secret DC 18 Perception check for each character taking a look around. If anyone succeeds, they spot a loose piece of stone masonry in the crumbling chimney set into the estate’s north wall. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.404,r=0.890,b=0.539), with ID ed00f86f-522f-4a9b-b53c-bfdfc9d2719c -->

Reward: Behind the stone is a copper lockbox covered in a green patina. Inside is an old, leather-bound book and a tarnished silver amulet. The book is a piece of the Bolmere family history, listing births and deaths going back several hundred years. Looking through these names does confirm a distant relationship between the PC, the Bolmere family, and Targen and his daughter. There might very well be other revelations in here, but those are left for you to decide based on the character’s backstory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.548,t=0.541,r=0.891,b=0.693), with ID 886a123e-318e-4290-a6ce-0b64839edb9c -->

The silver amulet is an old family treasure. While
it bears a faint aura of conjuration, it does not seem
to have any powers, but the word “Karvasalon”
is carved into the back. If someone wearing
the amulet casts a _planar ally_ ritual while
speaking that name, instead of what they
were intending to call, the amulet calls
a mysterious creature cloaked in
shadows. This thing has served
the family for centuries, and
although no one has called it
in many years, it still answers the summons. The
creature refuses to say why, but when asked about
the arrangement, it merely states that it owes “an
eternal debt.” The exact statistics and abilities of
Karvasalon are up to you to decide, as is the creature’s <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.547,t=0.694,r=0.890,b=0.938), with ID aa45f419-dcc0-482b-ae45-57655d35623b -->

Last Delivery  
Background: Teamster  
Bort’s death has repercussions for the members of the caravan, including for any PC who works for the caravan, even if they are relatively new to the team. The most pressing challenges are being handled by Tamli and the others, but in going through Bort’s ledgers, she discovers that he still has one last delivery to make here in town. This side quest can occur at any time after Bort’s death, starting when Tamli comes to find them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.169,r=0.453,b=0.342), with ID ca3ef7d5-36aa-4648-94f8-be882be413de -->

Emerging from the yard, you can see Tamli carrying something long and awkward wrapped in burlap. She catches your eye and makes her way straight to you. “I have a little chore that needs to be seen to. Bort’s final delivery is here in town, and it needs to be done delicately.” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.353,r=0.452,b=0.436), with ID 86cb9b1a-2b01-4acc-9bef-262497a5b417 -->

Tamli unwraps the burlap bundle to reveal a pair of sparring swords that were ordered by Pari Hemsoth, a young woman who lives with her mother on a farm about a mile from town. Bort’s records for the delivery included a rather cryptic note that reads, “Make sure the mother doesn’t find out.” While Tamli does not quite know what this means, she trusts that the PCs will deliver the goods discreetly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.447,r=0.452,b=0.571), with ID 6a8f5d50-f0c6-45c5-945f-d2b72f36fba9 -->

In truth, Pari wants the swords so that she can advance her training. She hopes to leave this town sometime soon, hopefully as an adventurer. This has been her dream since she was little, when her older brother died in the Goblinblood Wars, but the loss of her brother has made her mother paranoid and extremely overprotective of her only remaining child.

Getting out to the Hemsoth farm is not difficult, but approaching it to make the delivery without being spotted by Pari’s mother takes a bit of ingenuity. The PCs could simply use Stealth, but making it up to the farm without being seen requires succeeding at at least two consecutive DC 18 Stealth checks. Failure results in Elmora, the mother, storming out and demanding that the “vagrants” get off her farm at once. She does not want any adventurers talking to her daughter. Another option is for the PCs to try distracting the mother with a Bluff, Diplomacy, or even Thievery check, making it much easier for someone else to sneak up. Ultimately, any reasonable plan should have a good chance of success. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.109,t=0.573,r=0.452,b=0.888), with ID a060c34c-0d44-47e1-86d9-6817fccbc2f3 -->

Once the PCs have found a way to deliver the
swords, Pari is very grateful. While she is happy
that she can continue her training regardless, she <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.894,r=0.453,b=0.939), with ID 3c1cdb8e-91d6-4949-bbf0-b04dbd2d8aa8 -->

asks if any of the PCs might be willing
to help her learn how to use a sword. If a
PC agrees, she will happily pay for the service.
This allows a character to spend downtime to
earn gold, using their attack bonus in place of
a Lore or Crafting skill modifier as long as they
are trained in martial weapons. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.126,r=0.787,b=0.235), with ID a1ae9b7a-7377-459e-93b0-8a753f7d8b1b -->

New Faith  
Background: Missionary (Acolyte)  
The town of Etran’s Folly has not had a proper church since Father Bolgrist died of the plague nearly 20 years ago. When the plague hit and the fiery priest of Gozreh blamed Silwyth, calling her a witch, most in town believed him. When the priest himself succumbed to the plague, most considered the matter closed. Since then, the town has been without a priest and his shrine has fallen into ruin, being used as a barn on the edge of town. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.476,t=0.247,r=0.818,b=0.417), with ID 93f93bef-fbe3-48a8-b16d-9aa498a27dad -->

If the characters poke around the old church, an
aging dwarven farmer ambles up and asks what they
want with his barn. Introducing himself as Metmon,
he explains that he has been using the old church as
a barn for almost 10 years now, but he doesn’t have
too much use for it these days. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.419,r=0.818,b=0.509), with ID 0d7a35ac-ab13-46a6-a521-1c238e845584 -->

If the PC show signs of faith, Metmon says that
they can have the old building if they plan on
bringing “godly ways” back to the town. Metmon is
a worshipper of Abadar, but he will be just as happy
to see the church of any good or lawful neutral
deity established in town. He even offers the help of
his son, Edfur, in cleaning out the place. If the PCs
agree, this can become a downtime activity for one
or more characters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.511,r=0.817,b=0.646), with ID 5f589660-be49-4b6c-8526-3be81f73432a -->

Clearing out the church and repairing the roof
take at least 20 days to complete, but this can be
reduced to 15 with Edfur’s help. During this time, if
one of the PCs helping Edfur is trained in Religion,
the young dwarf becomes very curious about that
PC’s faith, asking all sorts of questions and showing
a genuine interest in the PC’s beliefs. If the PC
engages with Edfur, he asks what he has to do to
become a priest of the faith. He explains that if he
can learn enough, he hopes to one day become the
town’s priest, leading the people of Etran’s Folly in
spiritual matters. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.649,r=0.817,b=0.831), with ID 520c8295-ffa0-4200-a388-c6c1b2d8324f -->

How this side quest comes to a conclusion is
really up to the PC. They can spend time with Edfur,
teaching him about the faith, or they can send him
to nearby Elidir for more formal training. The PC
might decide to stay in Etran’s Folly for a time,
tending to the locals until Edfur is ready, or they
might even retire from adventuring to live here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.477,t=0.834,r=0.818,b=0.938), with ID cef37f11-a3fe-43aa-bcdb-57d13380341d -->

**TREASURE**
While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims’ wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.180,t=0.119,r=0.408,b=0.343), with ID a63ec0de-7894-4770-b23c-afe54a59dbc9 -->

Summary : This is a digital illustration of a fantasy plant creature, likely from a tabletop role-playing game bestiary, depicting a menacing, animated vine with a bulbous, toothy head and leafy base.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a single, large, dark purple vine with a thick, sinuous stem that curves upward and forward, ending in a bulbous head with two fang-like protrusions.
  • The base of the vine is surrounded by a dense cluster of green leaves, suggesting it is rooted in the ground.
  • The perspective is side-on, showing the full length of the vine and its head, with the leafy base in the foreground.
  • The lighting is even and digital, with no strong shadows or highlights; the colour palette is dominated by dark purples, greens, and browns.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, magnification, or measurement indicators are present.
  • No on-image text, UI elements, or labels are visible.
  • The illustration is clean and stylized, with smooth shading and clear outlines.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The vine's head is positioned in the upper left quadrant, curving down toward the center, while the leafy base spreads horizontally across the bottom.
  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the vine's head and curve drawing the viewer's eye from top left to center.
  • The background is white, isolating the plant and focusing attention on its form.

Analysis :
  • The illustration conveys a sense of menace and animation, suggesting the plant is predatory or dangerous.
  • The exaggerated curve and fang-like head imply movement and threat, typical of fantasy monster design.
  • The leafy base grounds the creature, making it appear as if it could blend into undergrowth before striking. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.480,r=0.508,b=0.963), with ID 17a49fc0-5544-449d-a62a-cb6e3de89eb2 -->

**Blood Siphon** ![inline micro-figure: two black diamond icons] The tendrils of the bush reach out to siphon the blood from a victim up to 20 feet away with persistent bleed damage, causing the victim to immediately take that amount of bleed damage (basic Reflex DC 17). The bush regains an amount of Hit Points equal to double the damage dealt. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.326,r=0.885,b=0.402), with ID 3a737b73-58f9-4b69-ba1b-a5ef1d1db324 -->

**Spinning Strike** ![inline micro-figure: three black chevrons] The bush spins in a circle, lashing out in all directions at once. It makes one attack roll and compares the result to the AC of each creature within its melee reach, rolling damage only once and applying it to each creature hit. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.402,r=0.889,b=0.464), with ID 3f6f8151-2ddb-4693-9eda-91baee3da674 -->

Weeping Wounds A bloodlash bush’s vines cause terrible lacerations that continue to bleed. A creature hit with a vine attack takes 1 persistent bleed damage (2 on a critical hit). Unlike other forms of persistent damage, this damage is cumulative, to a maximum of 5 persistent bleed damage but it can be stopped like any other persistent bleed damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.426,t=0.463,r=0.889,b=0.541), with ID 928d7378-33d4-414a-a8a7-d59e54759cf8 -->

**Light Hold** A creature grabbed by a vine lasher is not immobilized, but the grabbed creature's space and every adjacent square use the rules for difficult terrain. If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed creature within 10 feet of itself. If two or more vine lashers have a creature grabbed in this way, then the target's space and adjacent square instead use the rules for greater difficult terrain. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.440,t=0.709,r=0.891,b=0.802), with ID 853ce5f0-3e57-4176-8410-094f243cbae7 -->

Often overlooked in light of more obvious threats, some plants can be just as deadly and dangerous as wild beasts.
    The bloodlash bush attempts to lacerate its foes, using its weeping wounds to irrigate the ground around itself. The seeds of a bloodlash bush can take root only in soil that has been soaked in blood.
    The vine lasher attacks in groups, attempting to immobilize prey and slowly tear a creature to pieces. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.448,t=0.815,r=0.893,b=0.941), with ID c81f880a-00fb-4c93-9e07-cc88b5f69bca -->

**Siphon Vitality** ![inline micro-figure: two black diamond icons] The blood ooze draws forth blood from nearby creatures, causing their flesh to break open and blood to spill out which replenishes the blood ooze.

The blood ooze regains an amount of Hit Points equal to half the damage Siphon Vitality dealt to the single creature that took the most damage. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.478,r=0.572,b=0.573), with ID 7b44bce7-7c12-4f21-88b1-0e2ee8a5df2a -->

VARIANTS
Blood oozes are sometimes made from creatures with very different types of blood that can occasional impart other powers and abilities to the resulting blood ooze. Blood oozes made from dragon blood often gain some small amount of energy resistance based on the dragon’s type (fire resistance 5 for an ooze crafted from a red dragon, for example). Those made from trolls gain a limited form of regeneration. Finally, a blood ooze made from the blood of fiends might gain a cruel and vindictive intelligence drawn from the thoughts and minds of its parent creatures. Such an ooze might even work with others, tricking lesser creatures into thinking it is some sort of deity or engaging in whatever ruse it can contrive to secure a constant source of fresh blood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.591,t=0.112,r=0.819,b=0.559), with ID ab3507e6-76ea-41c6-86d4-ae715fa16fc3 -->

Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws near, leaving the body a husk of its former self. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.106,t=0.585,r=0.477,b=0.678), with ID 39a43495-7642-4aeb-b0a3-aca347d77ed4 -->

The process by which such an ooze is created involves draining the blood of at least four Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected blood to a fifth creature, along with deadly reagents designed to prevent the blood from coagulating. During this time, the host slowly dies while the blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6 hours later. Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who created them, but some creators have noted that newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming other members of the host creature’s family. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.678,r=0.439,b=0.848), with ID 3a00a4c2-0ea1-43fa-85c5-393f32a94a99 -->

It is not widely known that an existing
blood ooze can reproduce by splitting
itself in half. It undergoes this division
only if it has grown so large that
splitting in half would create a pair of
normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed above. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.107,t=0.848,r=0.469,b=0.940), with ID 1096cdb8-f974-43e9-ac99-98522284d2e2 -->

# ADVENTURE

## A TROUBLED TOWN

A group of new adventurers traveling through the village of Etran’s Folly—also known as Plaguestone—must come together to solve the murder of a friend. What starts as a simple investigation quickly turns sinister with the discovery of forbidden alchemy, mutant animals, and a nearby forest rotting away due to a mysterious blight. It becomes clear that if these heroes don’t intervene to stop whatever evil is brewing, the fall of Plaguestone is all but certain! The Fall of Plaguestone is the first standalone adventure for Pathfinder Second Edition, designed for 1st-level characters. It tells the story of how a group of strangers band together to form a group of adventurers while saving the town of Etran’s Folly from a terrifying fate, serving as a perfect introduction to a new Pathfinder campaign! <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.001,r=0.856,b=0.240), with ID f313970b-44a0-4145-add7-0b3a182dee3d -->

Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration depicting three adventurers in a dense, mystical forest setting, with dramatic lighting and dynamic poses suggesting a tense or action-filled moment.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Three armored and armed characters are present: one crouched in the foreground with a shield, one with long white hair in blue clothing to the left, and one standing on a rock in the background aiming a crossbow.
  • The setting is a lush, green forest with large, twisted tree roots and beams of sunlight filtering through the canopy.
  • The composition is dynamic, with the foreground characters partially obscured by wooden crates, suggesting a moment of stealth or ambush.
  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and muted blues, with high contrast between the sunlit background and the shadowed foreground.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.
  • The illustration uses painterly digital art techniques, with detailed rendering of armor, weapons, and forest elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The crouched character with a shield is in the immediate foreground, partially behind a crate.
  • The character in blue is positioned to the left, mid-ground, facing the standing figure.
  • The standing figure with the crossbow is elevated on a rock, backlit by sunlight, and positioned centrally in the background.
  • The arrangement creates a sense of depth and tension, with the viewer’s eye drawn from the foreground action to the illuminated background.

Analysis :
  • The scene conveys a narrative moment, likely an ambush or confrontation, with the characters’ poses and placement suggesting readiness and alertness.
  • The use of lighting and perspective emphasizes the dramatic and fantastical nature of the setting, highlighting the central figure as a focal point.
  • The presence of crates and gear hints at a possible camp or supply area, adding context to the encounter. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.002,t=0.246,r=0.998,b=0.682), with ID b23665c9-648e-4554-aec1-764e9057eb41 -->
