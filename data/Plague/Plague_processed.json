Alas, the pox was too virulent, and in the panic, the townsfolk blamed Silwyth for not coming to their aid. When the aging elf caught the plague herself, the townsfolk refused her succor, leaving no food for her at the plaguestone. She died soon after, cursing survivors to a life of misery, leaving her daughter, Vilree, all alone. The young half-elf Vilree never forgave the people of Etran's Folly for their treatment of her mother.\n\nOver the years, Vilree lived in the shadow of Etran's Folly; stained by her mother's reputation, she never found acceptance in town. Seven years ago, she left and took up residence in a nearby ancient cave complex. Bitterness grew in her heart, motivating her to learn alchemical arts her mother had once used to heal. She gained even greater skill than Silwyth had, but she used her talents to harm animals, plants, and people around her. What began with simple concoctions quickly turned into experiments on animals and then hapless travelers. Now she is planning to get her revenge on the town, using the very stone where they denied her mother aid. It is the eve of her triumph, one that will kill every last person in Etran's Folly.",

The caustic wolf uses his howl\nearly in the fight and his acid breath only once he\nhas been damaged.

The map shows a forest clearing with labeled encounter areas, terrain features, and a grid for movement measurement.\n\nmap:\nScope & Reference :\n  • The map covers a forested area with a clearing and a cave, labeled \"The Blighted Den.\"\n  • A grid overlays the map, with each square representing 5 feet.\n  • A compass rose in the lower left indicates cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).\n\nKeys & Annotations :\n  • Two labeled encounter areas: \"G1\" (central clearing) and \"G2\" (cave chamber).\n  • \"THE BLIGHTED DEN\" is labeled in the upper left.\n  • \"1 SQUARE = 5 FEET\" is noted in the lower right.\n  • A pool of water is illustrated in the cave (G2), and a creature token is present.\n  • Three tree stumps or logs are in the clearing (G1), and a large fallen log is to the north.\n  • Stairs and large tree roots connect the clearing to the cave entrance.\n\nOrdering :\n  • The map is oriented with north at the top.\n  • The main path enters from the east, leading west into the clearing (G1), then up stairs and roots into the cave (G2).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The map is structured for tactical encounters, with clear movement paths and terrain features for cover or obstacles.\n  • The cave (G2) is separated from the clearing (G1) by elevation and natural barriers, suggesting a defensible position.\n  • The grid and scale support precise movement and positioning for gameplay.",

The scrolls belonged to the war band's shaman, who tried to leave soon after Vilree arrived but, unbeknownst to Nar, Vilree captured her and used her to create the Amalgam (see area I16). Finally, the compartment contains a tiny straw doll made to look like Vilree that Nar keeps here to practice talking to his mistress.

As the PCs get closer to the cave walls, the character with the highest Perception notices veins of green in the rock. This ore is a key ingredient in the creation of the viridian vapor, and part of the reason it is so deadly. When ground up, the green rock deals serious damage to the lungs, allowing an infection to take hold and grow within hours. If the characters have studied Vilree's formula book, they know this green rock is called flaystone.",

When the giant tasted the broth, it froze his mouth shut, and Bort was able to escape with his entire crew during the confusion.\n\n**Pharasma's Comb:** One day, while crossing the waters of Lake Encarthan, Bort's boat was set upon by a mighty storm and the ship capsized. As the sea took him, the crafty merchant grabbed hold of one of his treasured lock boxes as he slid beneath the waves, only to awake in front of Pharasma, about to be judged. Alas, the lady of death could not decide his fate because her hair was being tussled by the storm winds that brought Bort before her. Not wanting to be inconsiderate, the merchant dug through his lockbox and found a silver comb that he gave to the lady to tame her hair. So impressed was she by the gift, she returned the dwarf and his entire crew to the shores of the lake, alive and well.",

Her time with the druids was not to last, for soon after the desire to wander called to her, and she left Nirmathas, joining up with Bort's caravan to travel and see the world. Glunda regularly uses her rudimentary skills to speak to the pack animals and tend to their needs. She almost never talks to anyone other than Tamli and Bort unless absolutely necessary, preferring to sleep near the animals rather than gather round the fire.",

In addition to the backgrounds presented in that book, the following are additional background options available to PCs at the start of the game to represent their ties to the world and the story that is unfolding in Isger and its neighboring countries. Some of these backgrounds might be referenced later on in this adventure connected to additional encounters or interactions with NPCs in the village, but the GM should feel free to tailor these to apply to other backgrounds where appropriate. These backgrounds are also referenced in the Concluding the Adventure section on page 49, which gives GMs ideas for including these backgrounds as part of the campaign.",

If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb's energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on).

Those made from trolls gain a limited form of regeneration. Finally, a blood ooze made from the blood of fiends might gain a cruel and vindictive intelligence drawn from the thoughts and minds of its parent creatures.

What starts as a simple investigation quickly turns sinister with the discovery of forbidden alchemy, mutant animals, and a nearby forest rotting away due to a mysterious blight. It becomes clear that if these heroes don't intervene to stop whatever evil is brewing, the fall of Plaguestone is all but certain! The Fall of Plaguestone is the first standalone adventure for Pathfinder Second Edition, designed for 1st-level characters. It tells the story of how a group of strangers band together to form a group of adventurers while saving the town of Etran's Folly from a terrifying fate, serving as a perfect introduction to a new Pathfinder campaign!",

    "text": "Summary : This is a fantasy-style illustration depicting three adventurers in a dense, mystical forest setting, with dramatic lighting and dynamic poses suggesting a tense or action-filled moment.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Three armored and armed characters are present: one crouched in the foreground with a shield, one with long white hair in blue clothing to the left, and one standing on a rock in the background aiming a crossbow.\n  • The setting is a lush, green forest with large, twisted tree roots and beams of sunlight filtering through the canopy.\n  • The composition is dynamic, with the foreground characters partially obscured by wooden crates, suggesting a moment of stealth or ambush.\n  • The color palette is dominated by earthy greens, browns, and muted blues, with high contrast between the sunlit background and the shadowed foreground.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, text, or UI elements are visible.\n  • The illustration uses painterly digital art techniques, with detailed rendering of armor, weapons, and forest elements.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The crouched character with a shield is in the immediate foreground, partially behind a crate.\n  • The character in blue is positioned to the left, mid-ground, facing the standing figure.\n  • The standing figure with the crossbow is elevated on a rock, backlit by sunlight, and positioned centrally in the background.\n  • The arrangement creates a sense of depth and tension, with the viewer's eye drawn from the foreground action to the illuminated background.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The scene conveys a narrative moment, likely an ambush or confrontation, with the characters' poses and placement suggesting readiness and alertness.\n  • The use of lighting and perspective emphasizes the dramatic and fantastical nature of the setting, highlighting the central figure as a focal point.\n  • The presence of crates and gear hints at a possible camp or supply area, adding context to the encounter.",
