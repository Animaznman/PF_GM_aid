      "# INTRODUCTION *Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. This book combines with Player Core, expanding on its options and giving you even more ways to play the character you want!*\n",
      "## MORE OF EVERYTHING *Player Core 2* provides even more options for player characters. Along with the ancestries and classes summarized on the following page, there are additional general and skill feats, equipment, spells, and treasure round out your characters' abilities.\n",
      "Alongside the eight new multiclass archetypes for the classes in this book, you can find archetypes for all sorts of characters starting on page 172. These can expand any Pathfinder character in unexpected directions, helping them discover new abilities to match their developing stories. Many of these archetypes support combat specializations, like the bastion and wrestler, while others show off the roles characters may be stepping into, like the blessed one and marshal. Even characters' growing skills can uncover deeper specializations, like the archaeologist and medic.\n",
      "In addition to an expansive slate of ancestries, this book also contains three versatile heritages suitable for characters of any ancestry:\n",
      "- • Dhampirs are the mortal offspring of vampires, walking the line between life and undeath. - • Dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits owing to dragons' influence, either direct or on their ancestors. - • Duskwalkers are souls reincarnated as a result of a bargain between psychopomps, the guides of the dead.\n"
